Territory of dispute, Area S09...

FAL: FF FNC. Calling FF FNC.

The sound of chewing comes through the channel.

FF FNC: Mghmm...nom... (Chewing)

FAL: (Sighs) Talk to me after you swallow your snack.

FF FNC: Mghmm! Hmm! Mghmmghmmghmm! (Chewing)

FF FNC: Gulp! I'm done! What's up, FAL?

FAL: Don't "what's up" me... I'm asking for your report obviously.

FAL: You've reached the designated base, right? Taken a good look at the abnormal Sangvis signal yet?

FF FNC: Nothing spotted yet...other than some Sangvis patrols.

FAL: What about 49? She's scouting at another outpost, isn't she?

FF FNC: She did report a lot of stuff. Seriously...she would report anything that twitches.

FF FNC: There IS something that kinda bothers me, (mutters) though it has nothing to do with S.F...

FAL: Do tell.

FF FNC: The weather! The weather is rather bizarre today...

FF FNC: Strong winds, low air pressure… The sky isn't looking very good either.

FAL: Tell me what you see.

FF FNC: There...

FF FNC: Look at those black clouds. Don't they look like a whirlpool?

FF FNC: You only see those on weather forecasts, right?

FF FNC: They're like a bunch of angry marshmellows about to explode any second.

FAL: You're right. But S.F...shouldn't have any weapons that can affect the weather.

FAL: Is this something to worry about? Or am I being paranoid...

FAL: FF FNC, next time you'd better...

(Static)

FF FNC: Quoi? What did you say, FAL?

(Static)

FF FNC: Tsk. Such bad timing...

FF FNC: That's why I keep saying FAL babbles too much! Why didn't she just get right to the point?!

FF FNC: What should I do now... Maybe get in touch with 49? Sounds like a plan!

FF FNC calling FF FN49.

...Click.

...Click...click...click.

(Static)

FF FN49: FF FNC... Hey...

FF FNC: Hmm...her comms are acting up too...

FF FNC: Or could the problem...be with me...?

FF FNC: Or is it...the weather?

FF FN49: FF FNC...watch out...

FF FNC: Huh? 49? Come again?

FF FN49: ...Intru...

FF FN49: She's back...watch out!

FF FNC: Intrude? What's intruding...?

...Pssst!...Psst!

FF FNC: Zut! Comms are completely down! This blasted weather!

FF FNC looks up to the sky.

FF FNC: ...!

FF FNC: What...the hell is that...?

Sparks appear in the center of the black swirling clouds...

FF FNC: ...

FF FNC: This...has to be some kind of special effect, right...?

It's almost like...some "spirit" is gonna come out from there...

FF FNC: ...!!

Meanwhile, at Griffin Control in Area S09.

FAL: Hey! FF FNC? Hey!

FAL: Comms broke down all of a sudden. Could it be the enemy...?

FAL: 57, go check the connection.

Five-seven: There's no problem with our comms.

Five-seven: By the by, I checked before you even asked.

FAL: Being a smartass won't get you promoted, ma chère 57.

Five-seven: Ouais, ouais, ouais. You prattle too much...

Five-seven: Anyway, don't you think this has something to do with FF FNC's report?

FAL: The weather? I reserve my judgment.

FAL: Our network would hardly be disrupted by something this minor, and there's been no sign of S.F. using such weapons.

Five-seven: But just in case, what if it isn't S.F.?

Five-seven: What I'm saying is that this abnormal weather could be the doing of a third party.

Five-seven: Of course, this could just be total nonsense, bien sûr...

FAL: You can be fanciful, but...I do think you have a point.

Five-seven: Oh? You agree with me? Must be my lucky day.

FAL: One learns to give credit to intuition and luck after a while on the battlefield. That's why you're my vice-leader.

Five-seven: I'll take that as a compliment.

Five-seven: Still, it doesn't hurt to be more straightforward every once in while...

BOOM!

Five-seven: Whoa!

FAL: Ack! These massive quakes...!

Five-seven: ...Are originated from the northwest! ...That's the location of our mission!

FAL: It spread all the way here? What on earth happened?

Five-seven: The precise energy source is currently unknown... Wait, the connection is up again!

FF FNC: (Pant...pant…) Is...is anybody there?!

FAL: FF FNC! What happened over there?!

FF FNC: Thank goodness... The call finally connected!

FF FNC: W...We ran into Intruder!

FAL: ...!

FAL: Was that her doing just now?

FF FNC: No idea... Then...there was lightning in the sky!

FAL: ...Quoi?

FF FNC: An insanely huge lightning! It blew everything up here like a bomb!

FAL: Could lightning...be this destructive?

FF FNC: In any case, I wasn't hit...

FF FNC: But Intruder vanished after that. Who knows when she's coming back.

FF FNC: I also found an unconscious human female nearby.

FAL: ...A woman?

FF FNC: Blonde...wearing some weird clothes. Doesn't seem to be from around here.

FF FNC: But the situation is becoming critical. S.F. units are on the move because of that commotion just now.

FAL: We'll move in right away to provide support. Go find 49 immediately.

FAL: Protect that woman while you're at it.

FAL: Move covertly for now. Rendezvous with us before we retreat together.

FF FNC: U-Understood!

FAL: Commander, looks like we have to set off.

Five-seven: Oh là là! We can finally stop collecting dust in here.

Five-seven: But if that lightning thing really is some sort of Sangvis weapon...not good, is it?

FAL: Report this to Helian. They might be able to get some information out of Architect.

FAL: This time, things...could be well beyond our imagination.

FAL: Allons-y, it's time for Team FF to regroup.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Griffin Control in Area S09, after Team FF retreated successfully...

FF FN49: (Sobs) I...I thought I was gonna die for sure!

FF FNC: What's there to be scared of, seriously?

FF FNC: Though that crazy lightning did make me jump out of my skin...

Five-seven: Alright, alright. As long as everyone is okay...

Five-seven: So, have they figured out what that massive lightning strike was?

FAL: Helian asked questions but didn't get much of an answer... Architect seemed pretty shocked too.

FAL: If the one in charge of running tests on Sangvis weaponry doesn't have a clue, then it probably has nothing to do with S.F.

FAL: Now, the only mystery is... (glances at the blonde girl)

FAL: FF FNC, how did you find her?

FF FNC: I didn't see her while I was scouting...

FF FNC: But after the lightning strike, she's just there, lying in the rubble.

FF FN49: The way she appeared was so bizarre... D-Do you think she's human? Look at her strange clothes...

FAL: Her physical features do suggest she's human, but there's nothing that sheds light on her identity.

FAL: Still, she most likely has something to do with the lightning strike...

Blonde girl: Hmm... Ugh...

FF FN49: Whoa! S-She's awake!

Blonde girl: What a racket... Huh? W-Where am I?

FAL: You speak our language? Wonderful...

FAL: Please state your identity and objective.

Blonde girl: H-Huh? Me?

Blonde girl: Argh! My head hurts! What in the world...?

Blonde girl: Oh right! I remember falling into a Cauldron, then...

FAL: (Sighs) Apologies, but please get to the point.

Noel: Ah, I'm sorry! My name is Noel Vermillion! Say, you guys...

Noel: This place looks almost like Kokonoe's lab... Are you from Sector Seven?

FAL: Sector Seven? What's that?

Noel: Uh, sorry. I'm not asking my questions in order. I did pass through a Cauldron, after all...

Noel: May I ask, what year is this?

FAL: ...2062. This is Griffin Control in Area S09.

Noel: ...

Noel: ...WHAT?!

Noel: The Gregorian calendar?! 100 years ago... Have I traveled this far?!

Noel: Area S09... I've never heard of this place before...

Noel: Griffin... What on earth...?

FAL: …Did you guys pick up a psychiatric patient? (Gestures at her head)

FF FNC: I-I don't know... Should I call the hospital?

Five-seven: Voilà! Already on it.

Noel: W-Wait! I'm not a weirdo!

Noel: I know it's hard to believe, but please listen to me...

Noel: I'm a traveler from the future.

FAL: ...

Noel: ...

Noel: Sigh...I know. You won't believe me...

FAL: Hold on. Do you know what the lightning strike just now was?

Noel: Lightning strike?

FAL: A massive lightning struck the spot where you appeared. We found you after that.

Noel: Lightning strike... Don't tell me...!

Noel: I think a ray of light flashed past me while I was passing through the Cauldron. I Then I lost consciousness...

Noel: Maybe that's what caused a distortion in space and brought me to this strange place...

Five-seven: What to do, FAL? Should we believe in such nonsensical raving?

FAL: ...Take her into custody for now. Report her name and do some investigation.

Noel: Th-that won't do! I can't stay here! I have to go back!

FF FNC: Aren't you a traveler? Can't you just "whoosh!" if you want to go back?

Noel: I can't go back without an Observer!

Five-seven: Observer? Another new archetype...?

Noel: The one who "observes" me... That's right!

Noel: She must be here as well! I saw her in the Cauldron!

Noel: She suddenly appeared before me together with that lightning strike...

Noel: She has long ears...more like bunny ears.

FF FN49: One of our T-Dolls DID wear something like that a few months ago.

FAL: Sorry, we didn't find any bunny girl at the scene.

Five-seven: It's enough of a shock finding a weirdo like you.

Noel: How...could that be...

Five-seven: Bien. Follow me, s'il vous plaît? Your room is ready.

Noel: (Sobs) Tsubaki... Makoto...

Noel: Will I ever see you again...?

After Noel and 57 left...

FAL: Phew...what a mess. Isn't it lively tonight?

FAL: Commander, do you believe what that nut case said?

FAL: If...IF she was telling the truth...

FAL: Then we might have missed something terribly important...

Meanwhile, at an abandoned Sangvis factory...

Intruder: Curiouser...and curiouser.

Intruder: I never expected the "spirit" that emerges from there to be this powerful.

Intruder: I thought we were already at the climax. Who would've thought a new character would be introduced at this point...

Intruder: Now then...how are you feeling, Miss New Girl?

Intruder: Destroy all the puppets on this stage as you please...

???: ...

Elphelt: Elphelt Valentine. Here to annihilate all unworthy Dolls!

A week after the Lightning Incident. Griffin Control in Area S09.

FF FNC: I see. So you're a soldier too?

Noel: Yeah... I'm still trying to wrap my head around what I've heard about things in this world...

FF FNC: I thought fashion from the future would be more stylish.

Noel: S-Sorry...for disappointing you.

Noel: But...do you believe me?

FF FNC: It's not like I don't believe you. I just don't really care either way...

FF FNC: Completing our mission is all that matters to us T-Dolls.

Noel: T-Dolls...so you really aren't human.

Noel: If you're androids, are you equipped with things like rocket fists or thrusters?

FF FNC: ...Are your androids equipped with such things?

Noel: Hmm... They're more like cyborgs, I guess...

FAL: Well, aren't you two getting along well?

FF FNC: Oh, FAL. Is it time to eat?

FAL: There's some bread, but let's talk about the mission first.

FAL: Ever since the Lightning Incident, S.F. has been launching attack after attack in nearby territories.

FAL: We've been receiving casualty reports from neighboring regions of Area S09.

FAL: Moreover...according to witnesses, there's someone with bunny ears among the Sangvis units.

Noel: Bunny ears! C-Could it be...

FAL: Unbelievable as it may be, that seems to be the one you were referring to.

Noel: It has to be her! If we can find her, I can go back!

FAL: At the moment, this bunny girl's motive is unclear...

FAL: But she's bothering us with all this trouble she's been stirring up.

FAL: Since she's your target as well, we have no choice but to work together.

Noel: Fantastic! I have hope of going home!

FAL: Sorry, Mademoiselle Noel, but let's not get too excited.

FAL: You're still under suspicion yourself, so your freedom is still restricted.

Noel: Oh... I'm sorry... I forgot my place...

FAL: The report has forecast the possible location of the next Sangvis attack.

FAL: Allez, girls, and get the one who's stuffing her face...

FAL: Operation Rabbit Hunt is about to begin.

FF FN49: Th-This is Point B... Evacuation of all residents confirmed.

Five-seven: Point C also checked. There shouldn't be a problem, I suppose?

FAL: Très bien. Now we just have to sit tight and wait for the rabbit to set off the trap...

Intruder: Nice setup. Your effort is much appreciated.

FAL: Intruder? How could it be you?!

Intruder: Forgive me, I can't let you see the Rabbit for now.

Intruder: But I trust that you won't be too offended if I take part in the show in her place?

FAL: Both you and the Rabbit are on our bucket list.

FAL: Though it seems like we can strike your name off early.

Intruder: Then thank you for your hospitality. Let us make the most of our chance meeting.
Part 2

Operation in progress.

FAL: How are things ahead? Still not done?

FF FNC: Non, not time yet! Intruder really is a handful!

FF FN49: All we can do is slightly reduce her strength, but we're far from actually neutralizing her.

Five-seven: I suggest we retreat for the time being, FAL. Wait for her supplies to deplete.

FAL: Can't be helped. Break it off for now. I'll put together the next round of offensive ASAP!
Part 3

...

FAL: The hunt is over, Intruder.

Intruder: That's quite alright. We've gained a lot.

Intruder: Too bad we haven't been able to find the real "Doll".

FAL: The real "Doll"?

Intruder: What the Rabbit is looking for...

Intruder: If she can't find it, then even I won't be able to prevent Dolls' annihilation.

Noel: ...

FF FN49: What on earth is your objective?

Intruder: Didn't you know? This is just a game.

Intruder: You're still very far from clearing this stage, so do take your time and enjoy yourselves...

FAL: Humph... Your death is the only thing we want to enjoy.

Intruder: Then sorry, but I haven't finished the script yet...

Intruder: Please let my name stay a little longer on your bucket list.

Five-seven: Zut! Smoke screen!

FAL: ...!

FAL: You think you can escape using such a cheap trick?!

Team FF focuses their firepower...

FF FN49: Sigh... She escaped after all.

FAL: Tsk! Right under my nose.

FF FNC: Looks like...we won't return empty-handed.

FAL: ...?

FF FNC: She seemed to have dropped this while running away... (Hands over)

FAL: This...looks like...

FAL: (Chuckles)

FF FNC: W-What is it?

FAL: Humph... I think we're gonna meet again very soon, Intruder.

Back at Griffin Control after the operation...

Five-seven: The Rabbit seems quite closely related to Sangvis Ferri.

FF FNC: FAL has already reported the evidence. We'll hear from them in no time.

Noel: ...

Five-seven: Is something wrong, Mademoiselle Noel?

Noel: Oh! Sorry. U-Umm...I was just thinking...

Noel: "The real Doll"... Could that be me?

Five-seven: ...You're a Doll?

Noel: How should I put it...? In a manner of speaking... I guess I am...

Noel: Of course, I'm not entirely sure...

Noel: Whether I'm the "Doll" that the Rabbit is looking for...

Five-seven: That's to say you're the cause of all the trouble we've been having?

Noel: Eep! I'm sorry! It's all my fault...

Five-seven: Exactement. It's all thanks to a weirdo like you that we're working our butts off.

Noel: (Whimpers) This awful feeling...of being blamed...

Noel: Seems pretty familiar...

FF FNC: Well... You don't have to put it that way...

Noel: Hmm?

FF FNC: Noel appeared as the lightning struck, right?

FF FNC: If it hadn't been for the lightning, Intruder could have done us in right then and there...

FF FNC: Perhaps...Noel saved us.

Noel: (Sobs) I-I'm so touched!

Noel: You're so nice, FF FNC! (Hugs)

FF FNC: Ack! L-Let go! You're...squeezing too hard!

FAL: ...We'll have to deal with this problem sooner or later.

FAL: If the Rabbit is after Noel, that makes our job easier.

Five-seven: Oh, there you are.

FAL: The result is out. That thing really is Intruder's communication module.

FAL: It's receiving a signal from a certain location, though the precise source is still unknown...

FAL: It does resemble the Rabbit's signal that we had detected before.

Five-seven: Bien! That's good news.

FAL: It's too early to celebrate, 57.

FAL: According to our surveillance, the signal is currently at an abandoned Sangvis factory up north. The factory has been inspected in the past.

FAL: Other than a sparse amount of Sangvis units wandering around, it is largely deserted.

FAL: Why would a clue be sitting at that sort of place... I have a bad feeling about this.

Noel: Should we take the initiative this time?

FAL: It's necessary to reinvestigate the site. Also...

FAL: Mademoiselle Noel, it's time you made yourself useful.

Noel: Huh?

FAL: If the Rabbit doesn't want to leave her hole...

FAL: Then we'll give her a "carrot".

Team FF reached the outskirts of the factory...

Noel: Um... By "carrot"...do you mean me?

FF FNC: You don't look very tasty to me.

FAL: That's right. You're to be the bait and lure the Rabbit out.

Noel: Sigh... That's what I thought...

FAL: First, we break into the factory and set up an ambush...

FAL: There's a server in there. We can access Sangvis comms by setting up a backdoor.

FAL: All we have to do is log in with Intruder's authorization code and send you to catch the Rabbit's attention.

FAL: That's the plan. Any questions?

Noel: ...

Noel: None at all! Very clear!

FAL: Oh? Aren't you quite the soldier now?

Noel: You're all helping me, after all. I'll also try my best to be of help!

FF FN49: Noel seems...pretty dependable.

Noel: Th-Thank you!

FAL: Relax. I don't actually expect your part to work.

FAL: I'm just giving you something to do while we conduct our investigation.

FAL: Be grateful that I'm giving you a chance.

Noel: Ack! Should I be happy about this? That's kinda hurtful...

Five-seven: We're only up against a few scattered Sangvis units, but don't let your guard down, okay?

FAL: Beating up those weak-ass mobs isn't even fun.

FAL: Let's move out. Time to wish the Rabbit bon appétit.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Team FF arrived at the operations control center in the factory...

Five-seven: Hmm... This should be the server.

Five-seven: Didn't think it'd still be operable. Now let's get started.

FAL: The rest of you come with me. We'll run a search in the area and set up our ambush.

FAL: Nobody is giving us the slip this time!

FF FN49: FAL still seems...pretty mad about letting Intruder escape before... (Whispers)

FF FNC: Can't be helped. The mission was a failure. She simply can't take this kind of... (Whispers)

FAL: Oi! Quit dawdling!

FF FNC: O-Okay... We're coming.

FF FN49: Do you think she heard us? (Whispers)

FF FNC: Don't worry. She's deaf when people talk behind her back... (Whispers)

FAL: I heard every single word you said, you know?

After the departure of the survey group...

Noel: Miss 57, is there anything I could help you with?

Five-seven: Oh dear, feeling lonely already?

Five-seven: Patience, ma chère. We're still searching for the signal.

Five-seven: If you want to help me out...why not tell me something interesting?

Noel: What...do you mean?

Five-seven: A "Doll"... That's what she called you, right?

Five-seven: In other words, you're not human, are you?

Noel: ...

Noel: That...doesn't feel right.

Five-seven: You're not denying it, but you think it doesn't "feel right" to say you're not human?

Five-seven: Haha, you really are a weirdo.

Noel: Have you ever been troubled by the fact that you're not human, Miss 57?

Five-seven: Hmm... Should I say I'm not programmed to feel that way, or I've simply never thought about it?

Five-seven: All I care about is "myself". I don't care "what" this "self" is.

Five-seven: Human or T-Doll, my purpose remains the same.

Five-seven: Other than the destiny and identity that you were born with...

Five-seven: Surely you also have...something that only belongs to you, and you alone?

Noel: ...

Noel: Yes, I do.

Noel: I have my own friends, and I have something that I must do.

Noel: The fact that I miss them...has nothing to do with my being a human or a Doll.

Noel: Which is why...I have to go back. Back to where I belong.

Noel: Thank you, Miss 57.

Five-seven: Haha, thank YOU.

Five-seven: That was some interesting conversation... Satisfying, isn't it?

Noel: Heheh...

Meanwhile, somewhere in the Sangvis factory...

Intruder: Do you have to go back?

Intruder: But now that you're in my garden, please do enjoy yourself.

Intruder: It's almost time for supper.

Intruder: The Rabbit will never let anyone escape...

Elphelt: ...

The survey group completed their mission.

FAL: How are things on your end, 57?

Five-seven: Right on time. Everything is ready here.

Five-seven: The Rabbit's signal has been located. We can make the connection anytime.

Noel: ...

FAL: All yours, Mademoiselle Noel.

Noel: Got it! Leave it to me.

Five-seven: Then let's begin...

...

Noel: Is this...the Rabbit?

Elphelt: ...

Noel: Um...hello?

Elphelt: ...

Noel: ...

FAL: ...

FAL: Say something else.

FAL: Huh? O-Okay.

Elphelt: ...

Noel: Are you...looking for the "Doll"? Please look at me! Am I the one you're looking for?

Elphelt: ...

FAL: No response at all. Have we failed?

FAL: ...

FAL: Something doesn't feel right...

FAL: What do you mean?

FAL: She seems...a bit different...

Elphelt: ...Annihilate...

FAL: ...!

Elphelt: Elphelt Valentine...

Elphelt: Here to annihilate all unworthy Dolls!

Connection broken...

FAL: That was...

BOOM!

FAL: Whoa! W-What's that?!

FF FN49: FAL! A surge in Sangvis numbers just ahead!

FAL: What?! Where did they come from?!

FF FN49: No idea! It's like they appeared out of thin air! There's no sign of an intrusion from outside!

Five-seven: FAL...we have a problem. The facilities in the factory have somehow been reactivated.

Five-seven: The scattered Sangvis units are revived...and their numbers are going up!

FAL: Tsk. So we're the ones getting ambushed.

FAL: That communication module has always been a trap...

Intruder: Finally caught on, eh?

FAL: Humph... Not exactly surprising, Intruder.

FAL: Though I wonder...how much more foreshadowing have you written into your script?

Intruder: No, I'm just a member of the audience myself. It's been quite entertaining how things have developed.

Intruder: It's just that without a bait, the prey won't fall into the trap.

Intruder: This is the final hunting ground. I look forward to your last performance...

Connection broken...

FAL: We'll see, Intruder.

FAL: I'll make you realize...that you've made a mistake with the cast.

Five-seven: FAL! The Rabbit is here!

Elphelt: Dolls... Annihilate all Dolls...

Noel: Has she...already made it this far?!

FAL: Mademoiselle Noel, for the sake of us all...

FAL: If you want to make it back alive, give it everything you've got.

Noel: Roger!

Noel: We're all definitely gonna make it back alive!

FAL: Let's go, everyone...

FAL: This is the final Rabbit Hunt!
Part 2

...

FF FNC: (Pants) Th-That's way too overpowered...

FF FN49: How...could she still be on her feet...?

Elphelt: Anni...hilate...all...Dolls...

FAL: She seems a bit different from the other Sangvis Dolls...

FAL: Doesn't she have..."emotions" of any kind?

Elphelt: ...

Noel: Different...

Noel: Different...?

Noel: That's right! She IS different!

FAL: What?

FAL: I remember you mentioned this before.

FAL: She looks different from when I saw her as we passed through the Cauldron!

FAL: Hmm?

FAL: So she isn't the Rabbit that you saw?

FAL: She looks like her, but...

FAL: I need further confirmation!

FAL: If only...if only I could talk to her in person...

FAL: This is not yet the time to meet her. We have to weaken her in order to approach her safely.

FAL: Reorganize our assault and keep at it until she makes a slip!
Part 3

...

FF FNC: That...should do it, right?

FF FN49: Is...is it over...?

Noel: I'll go and take a look!

FAL: Be careful, Noel.

FAL: Hey, who the hell are you?

Elphelt: ...

Elphelt: You...you are...

Noel: ...!

Noel: Does she know me?

Elphelt: D...Doll...

Elphelt: My...emotions...?

Elphelt: That's right... Valentine's...emotions...

Elphelt: Am...I...

Elphelt: Who...on earth...am I...?

Elphelt: ARGHHHHHHHHHH!

Elphelt collapses and becomes still.

FAL: ...

FAL: Stay put. I'll have a look.

FF FNC: B-Be careful...

FAL: ...

FAL: The neural pathways of her dummy network are cut off. She can't move at all.

Five-seven: Dummy network? Then she's...

FAL: Oui, just a modified S.F. dummy.

FAL: In other words...this isn't her master unit.

Noel: That's not her?

Noel: S-So, where's the real Elphelt?

FAL: If the dummy is here, then the master unit can't be far away...

FAL: Launch an immediate search at all suspicious locations nearby!

FF FN49: Understood!

Meanwhile, somewhere in the Sangvis factory...

Intruder: So this is how it ends this time?

Intruder: Nevermind. It's just a toy I picked up anyway...

Intruder: You did pretty well for an amateur entertainer.

Intruder: Then...thanks for your hard work. Looks like this is where we part.

Intruder: Wait for the prince who'll come and wake you...Miss Rabbit.

...

Elphelt: ...

Team FF has been searching for a while...

FAL: Is the suspicious receptacle you found somewhere around here, 49?

FF FN49: Should be... There it is.

Noel: The real...Elphelt...

Five-seven: Bien. Leave this to me. I'll deal with it...

Receptacle: ...

Receptacle: Authorization...Check...SP914 "Intruder".

Receptacle: Authorization complete.

Five-seven: Sorted.

The lid slowly slides open...

...

Elphelt: ...

Noel: Ah...

Noel: This is...

FAL: Well? Is this the girl you saw?

Noel: Y-Yes! That's her!

Noel: She's the Observer that observed me!

Elphelt: ...Ugh!

Elphelt: Elphelt Valentine, here to annihilate all unworthy Dolls!

Team FF: ...! (Raises gun)

Elphelt: Hmm?

Elphelt: W-What's going on?!

Elphelt: Why are there so many guns pointed at me?!

Elphelt: Ah, are you humans? I'm really sorry!

Elphelt: That was a line I've been programmed to deliver every time I wake up! Please don't take it seriously!

FAL: ...

Noel: ...

FF FNC: She doesn't seem dangerous.

Elphelt: Uh...excuse me...?

Elphelt: What's...going on right now?

FAL: (Sighs) This isn't really the place to talk. There could be remaining Sangvis units roaming about.

FAL: So...Mademoiselle Elphelt, oui?

FAL: Come with us. Rather than you asking us questions, I'm more interested in the answers you can give us...

After Team FF brought Elphelt back to base...

Elphelt: That's to say...we've come to a different world together?

Noel: Yes.

Elphelt: This is certainly not my time, and "Science" is still widely in use here.

Elphelt: It really is a different world.

Noel: That's right...

Noel: Since you appeared in the Cauldron, you must've come from another dimension as well, right?

Elphelt: All I remember...is St. Elmo's Fire striking down...

Elphelt: Then I saw you in an unfamiliar place. I don't remember anything afterwards...

FAL: Then you don't remember being used by Sangvis Ferri?

Elphelt: I was slumbering the whole time... I don't know anything.

FAL: (Sighs) We almost had our butts handed to us because of you...

FAL: Well, now we can hardly blame you for it, can we?

Elphelt: I'm so sorry! I can't believe I've done such horrible things...

Noel: It's not your fault! It's all because of that Sangvis Ferri person! And we're all fine now.

Elphelt: Miss Noel... Alright!

Elphelt: Haven't you been looking for me this whole time? I'll do my best to help you in any way I can!

Noel: Yeah! I need your power to send us back together!

Five-seven: How do you plan on doing that?

Noel: The Gate will open as long as an Observer is present.

Noel: We have to go back to where we first arrived.

FAL: Where the lightning struck?

Noel: Yes...that's the entrance as well as the exit.

FAL: My days... I'm still having trouble believing this.

FAL: Travelers from another dimension...

FAL: If I report something like this to Helian, she'll definitely think my neural cloud is fried.

FAL: Commander, please do something about the investigation report.

Five-seven: Isn't it fantastic, Mademoiselle Noel? You can finally go home.

Noel: Miss 57... Indeed. After all, the things that belong to me aren't here.

Elphelt: And I have my own mission to fulfill...

Elphelt: Thanks for saving me, everyone.

Five-seven: Bien. As a gesture of farewell, we'll escort you one last time...

Five-seven: To where the lightning struck.

Noel and co. arrived at the scene...

Noel: Right... If I use the Power of the Eye here...

Noel: Lux Sanctus, heed my call! Murakumo Unit, activate!

FF FNC: Whoa?!

Noel's form starts changing...

Noel: Phew...that seems to have worked.

Noel: I was worried I couldn't release this form.

FF FNC: M-Magnifique...

FAL: Well...NOW I truly believe you're from another dimension.

FF FN49: Incredible...

Elphelt: I'm ready here, Miss Noel.

Noel: Got it. Please give me a second...

Noel seems to be searching for something in the sky...

Noel: Ah! Got it! The Gate!

FF FNC: Gate? What gate? I'm not seeing anything...

Noel: It's a conceptual object that can only be perceived with my power. Ordinary people can't see it.

FF FNC: Okay... Another weird character setup of yours, eh?

Five-seven: Thank goodness you weren't captured by S.F.

Five-seven: Otherwise we'd be in big trouble.

FAL: Looks like it's time to say goodbye...

Noel: Miss Elphelt, please hold on tight.

Elphelt: Okay! Gotcha!

Noel: Then, thank you so much, my friends from Griffin!

FAL: Just don't come with any lightning bolts again.

FF FNC: Hmm...

FF FNC: I'm kinda curious about their world. Maybe I should go and have a look?

FF FN49: ...Are you serious?

FF FNC: ...Just kidding.

Elphelt: Don't worry! Maybe we'll meet again some day!

Five-seven: If so, I sincerely hope you'll be on our side.

Elphelt: Heheh... If you introduce some nice husband material to me, I'll think about it.

Five-seven: Oh...won't you consider girls?

Five-seven: See, I have "ears" just like yours.

Five-seven: If you'll take me as your "husband", I'll shower you with all the romance that you want... ❤

Elphelt: With a girl...?!

Elphelt: A-Absolutely not! If we commit such taboo...

Elphelt: Then my femininity... My femininity will...!

Five-seven: Heheh. What an amusing response.

Five-seven: It's an acceptable farewell gift.

Noel: Finished your goodbyes? Good...

Noel: Let's go, Miss Elphelt.

Elphelt: O-Okay! Then...

Elphelt: See you, my friends!

Noel: See you, everyone from Griffin!

FAL: Au revoir, travelers.

Noel and Elphelt take to the sky...

And disappear together through a crack in the air...

Five-seven: They vanished just like that...

Five-seven: If it weren't for the crater left by the lightning strike, I'd think I was dreaming.

FAL: Remember what they said? "See you"...

FAL: Who knows? Maybe we WILL meet again.

FF FNC: People from the future are so powerful...

FF FNC: They would make pretty good characters in fighting games, wouldn't they?

FF FN49: ...What makes you think that?

FF FNC: Eh...I'm not sure either.

Rumbles...

FF FNC: ...

FF FNC: Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go eat something?
