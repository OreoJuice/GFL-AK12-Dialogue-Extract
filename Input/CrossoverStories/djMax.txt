The longer someone lives, the bigger the world seems to them.

They aren't living life to the fullest if they don't realize that.

Some people take things one step at a time and will eventually find their destiny on bigger and bigger stages.

Others live by the rules and never stray off the beaten path.

Even when they're opening a packet of chips, they always follow the "tear here" instruction.

M950A is exactly that kind of person.

...Knock, knock!

M950A: Open up!

M950A: Hey, hurry up and open the door!

I despise people like that.

M950A: Open the door! Dorm inspection! Hurry!

...Ka-chak.

Thunder: Good morning, M950A.

M950A: You took your sweet time. Were you still in bed?!

Thunder: I was blow-drying my hair. Didn't hear you.

M950A: (Sighs) Couldn't you have done that earlier?

M950A: Where's AEK-999? It's almost time for today's training session.

Thunder: ...

M950A: Spit it out, Thunder. Where the hell did AEK run off to?

Thunder: (Silence) ...

M950A: Don't think that poker face is gonna fend me off.

M950A: I'm second in command here, so show some respect—

M950A: ...Oh, you moved.

...Thunder suddenly raises her weapon.

M950A: Hey, w-what are you trying to—

...BANG!!

...Thunder fires in M950A's direction. The bullet grazes past her hair, the thundering muzzle blast echoed in the hallway outside.

M950A: ...

M950A: W-w-w-why the heck did you do that?!

Thunder: To convey my feelings.

M950A: What feelings are you trying to convey by opening fire?! And your gun is freaking loud, you know?!

Thunder: Fear.

Thunder: I felt threatened by your aggressive manner, but I'm okay now.

...Thunder draws a deep breath.

Thunder: AEK left early in the morning. I don't know where she's gone.

M950A: You could've just told me; what's there to be scared of?!

M950A: And didn't I tell you to keep a close eye on her? That was why I put you two in the same dorm in the first place.

Thunder: "Advice For Griffin Rookies From Vets Who Have Been Through Some Crap" Rule No.999 – No one can find AEK-999 unless she wants to be found.

M950A: I've never heard of that before...

M950A: Wait...I know where AEK could be...

M950A: She must've gone "there" again! I've gotta catch her red-handed!

Thunder: ...

M950A: Stop spacing out. Come with me!

Thunder: I have to come with?

M950A: Of course, you're my partner!

Thunder: Since when?

M950A: Since always! We agreed on correcting people's lazy and undisciplined behavior around here!

Thunder: That's a one-sided demand on your part.

M950A: But haven't you always been helping me?

Thunder: That's because you're the only one who hangs out with me, for whatever reason.

M950A: I hang out with you because I believe that, like me, you're a reasonable person who respects the rules!

M950A: Our team leader is too nice and lets everyone have their way. AEK is a problematic child, and you can never tell what that quiet creep TMP is thinking.

M950A: You're the only one who kinda listens to me. Otherwise, I'd have no friends on the team at all.

Thunder: So you ARE aware of that.

M950A: How come you don't show any fear when you're saying that to my face?!

Thunder: Everyone says you're never honest with the Commander.

Thunder: Yet you don't hold back at all when tormenting us.

M950A: I just know my place and want everyone to do their job properly.

M950A: Why doesn't anyone understand that...?

M950A: (Mutters) Besides...what do they mean I'm not honest with the Commander...?

Thunder: So what do you want me to do?

M950A: Just do what I've always been doing.

...M950A and Thunder make their way down the hallway together.

M950A: Thunder, I really wish you could lend me your aid because...

Thunder: You'll pay me?

M950A: No!

M950A: I mean, you'd also want a neat and tidy working environment and be praised by the Commander for that, right?

Thunder: I'm not sure. You can simply give me an order.

M950A: No! I want you to change your own mind! I know you will understand me!

M950A: We're all members of Griffin – this kind of indolence has to go, right?!

Thunder: This is a place even Sangvis Ferri don't want to set foot in...

M950A: True, this city is completely abandoned, no humans have come by in years.

M950A: But it is our job to protect the area until the mining crew wraps up!

Thunder: But once they're done with the mining, our team will be disbanded and we'll all be going our separate ways.

M950A: Until then, we are family, and we need to be on our best behavior!

Thunder: With no one watching us, the Commander said we could relax a bit.

M950A: We need to take more initiative precisely because we don't have the Commander with us.

M950A: Otherwise, we wouldn't have time to react if S.F. decided to sabotage us all of a sudden!

M950A: We mustn't let our guard down until it's over. Don't you want to complete the mission without any regrets, Thunder?

Thunder: You've been nice to me and you spend time listening to me, M950A.

Thunder: I'll help you, even though I don't have any regrets.

M950A: Perhaps, but it doesn't hurt to take things seriously.

M950A: Then now we're officially partners!

Thunder: Partners?

M950A: That's right, we're both Griffin prefects working hand-in-hand to enforce order and discipline!

M950A: Right, we're here.

...The two have arrived at a dark and obscure chamber.

Thunder: What is this place? It's quite well hidden.

M950A: Hush...keep your voice down. We don't want to give ourselves away.

M950A: Remember? This used to be the arcade room. TMP and the others had it renovated after we moved in.

M950A: It hasn't been used for a long time and hardly anybody ever comes here.

Thunder: So it was an internet cafe?

M950A: Something like that, but it's more for games where you wear headsets – kinda like in electronic warfare.

M950A: I bet you anything...that AEK is in there.

Thunder: Doing what?

M950A: I told you, it's an arcade...

M950A: She's either playing online games or surfing the net and chatting with people or something?

Thunder: "Surfing the net"...

Thunder: You're so old-fashioned, M950A.

M950A: That's none of your business! I'm not using that phrase ever again!

M950A: In any case, it's not good to be addicted to such things! We must get inside and drag AEK outta—

??: Drag me out for what?

M950A: Whoa...!

AEK-999: Oh, did I scare you?

AEK-999: But what are you doing here? Even you're here, Thunder.

M950A: What are we doing? Looking for you, duh!

M950A: What are YOU doing here?!

AEK-999: Doing research.

AEK-999: Don't we have a training session today?

AEK-999: As you can see, this T-Doll has been learning from the humans by watching military documentaries. That makes perfect sense, right?

M950A: Oh really?

M950A: You never take the training seriously and are always slacking off!

AEK-999: But that's no reason to accuse me of not being motivated during my time off.

AEK-999: You don't think I'm here to hang out in chat rooms or play games, do you?

AEK-999: I know you're very eager to whip us into shape, but at least consider my personal taste – you think I'd have such lame hobbies?

M950A: Ha, don't bother.

M950A: Whether you're here to learn or to surf the net...

M950A: It'll all be clear when we look into your browser history.

AEK-999: ...

...M950A stares hard at AEK-999, but the latter remains stoic as ever.

...A few seconds later.

Thunder: ..."Surf the net".

M950A: Shut up, Thunder!

M950A: Come with me! We're about to find out for ourselves!

...The alarm goes off suddenly.

AEK-999: W-what's going on?!

M950A: A warning signal! Enemies incoming!

...Footsteps are coming from down the hallway.

??: Pant, pant...

M950A: Don't shoot, Thunder! It's one of our own!

M950A: TMP? Is that you, TMP?! What's happening? Report!

TMP: S-Sangvis Ferri! Our scouts have spotted S.F. in the distance!

TMP: Squad leader is calling for everyone to assemble. R-right now she's getting in touch with the Commander and asking for instructions!

M950A: Then let's go! Everyone, follow me!

M950A: It's finally time... This isn't a drill, but an actual fight!

M950A: I've got to show the Commander and everyone what I'm capable of!

K2: Oh, is everyone here already? That was quick.

M950A: What's the situation, Leader?

M950A: Where are the Sangvis Ferri? When do we start the counterattack?

K2: Uh, no rush at all. The S.F. are actually...still pretty far away.

M950A: Huh?

K2: They're beyond even the base sensor array's detection range, but since the scouts spotted them, I thought I'd assemble everyone and put us on alert.

M950A: But even the Commander is here. So now what, are we not even gonna fight??

K2: Uh...well...

K2: The Commander says that judging by the enemies' trajectory, they don't seem to be coming towards us. However, they don't look particularly strong either so if we want, we can go after them...

TMP: HQ have their hands full at the moment, so they probably...don't have time for us over here...

AEK-999: They're probably just passing by. There's no point for us to run all the way there just because we're bored.

AEK-999: Why don't we just let it be? We've all got stuff to do.

M950A: Oh? The high-and-mighty AEK has lost her guts all of a sudden?

AEK-999: I just don't want to make trouble out of nothing.

M950A: ...What about you, Thunder?

Thunder: I think it's better to strike first.

M950A: That's right. Sangvis Ferri is our enemy. We can't go wrong by attacking them. And we mustn't wait for them to make their way here, or we'll lose the initiative.

TMP: B-but we haven't seen actual battle in a long time...

M950A: Then this is our chance for combat experience. We can't give them the advantage.

K2: So what's the consensus...do we fight or not?

TMP: ... (Shakes head slowly)

AEK-999: I think we should have our scouts monitor them for now.

Thunder: I suggest we make the first move.

M950A: Let's go get them! Kill them all in one go!

K2: I also agree that we should sortie. Even if we aren't their target, they could still stir up trouble elsewhere.

K2: Besides...my hard-earned temporary command authorization hasn't seen any use yet, and it'll have to be uninstalled in a month. At least let me enjoy being a team leader for once?

M950A: Ha! Spoken like our amazing team leader. Well, AEK?

AEK-999: Tsk... Fine. I do enjoy a good fight.

K2: Right. Three to two. Let's move.

K2: Get yourselves ready. We're finally getting a proper workout.

...The team gets on with their preparations.

M950A: AEK, we're going to war.

M950A: Are you gonna keep those headphones on the whole time?

AEK-999: What, you don't like music?

M950A: I don't wanna get distracted when I'm in combat.

AEK-999: I'm the opposite. Don't worry, I won't slow you down.

M950A: You'd better not.

...M950A walked off, TMP approached AEK-999.

TMP: AEK, is everything...going to be alright?

AEK-999: Sure, I'm in tip-top form.

AEK-999: Because I just found a new song. Wanna listen to it?

TMP: Um...okay...

...TMP connects her headphones to AEK's sharing channel, and AEK presses the play button.

...Music starts playing.

TMP: Did you...get this from that "City" as well?

AEK-999: Yep. Suits me, doesn't it? I'm gonna do great today.

TMP: But...will you be going again? Didn't you promise me and—

AEK-999: I won't...

AEK-999: Soon, I won't have to. Relax.

...TMP nods.

M950A: Keep up, you two! We're leaving!

AEK-999: Alright!

AEK-999: C'mon, TMP.

AEK-999: Let's turn this world upside down!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Operation concluded. Sangvis forces eliminated.

AEK-999: They're all so weak!

AEK-999: Even fighting is boring all the way out here.

AEK-999: How much longer do I have to live like this? Boring enemies, boring teammates...

TMP: AEK?

AEK-999: Oh, nothing. Just letting off some steam.

AEK-999: Are you alright, TMP?

TMP: Uh...I think...

TMP: I was too nervous to really experience anything.

AEK-999: Now that the enemies are all dealt with, can we call it a day?

Thunder: Are there any backup forces from S.F., Squad Leader?

K2: Don't think so.

K2: The Commander says that according to HQ's analysis, it seemed to be a Sangvis envoy just passing through the area.

M950A: Huh? Why would they be passing through here?!

AEK-999: The point is – I told you so, 950.

M950A: So what? Think of it as a kind of alternative morning training!

K2: Gee, what's with the temper?

K2: Remember, we won. It's a victory we don't see often.

K2: C'mon, let's go back to the dorm and get some rest. Should we throw a party to celebrate tonight?

AEK-999: Sorry, I'm not particularly gratified by such a small victory.

AEK-999: I'm not coming tonight. Have fun, guys.

...AEK-999 walks off on her own.

TMP: AEK...

K2: That kid has been pretty lethargic lately...

M950A: ...

M950A: (Mutters) Thunder, come with me.

...M950A and Thunder slip quietly into the electronic entertainment room.

Thunder: Sorry to intrude.

M950A: Shush! Why are you announcing our presence?!

M950A: Ah...but AEK hasn't arrived yet. Thank goodness.

Thunder: Should we come back later?

M950A: No. We lie here in ambush, then jump and shout "aha!" when she sits down and logs on – we'll catch her red-handed!

Thunder: A...ha...

M950A: Maybe just leave that to me...

Thunder: Are you certain she'll come?

M950A: She was already thinking about ditching work before the battle and kept objecting to the fight. That's not like her at all.

M950A: So something here must have her enthralled.

Thunder: ...We're exactly like stalkers.

M950A: This is an investigation! C'mon, we've gotta hide.

...The two T-Dolls conceal themselves but ensured they have a clear field of vision to spy on the rest of the room.

...Ten minutes later.

...An hour later.

...Two hours later.

Thunder: (Whispers) 950...

Thunder: 950, wake up...

M950A: Hmm...

M950A: (Muffled) Hmm!

Thunder: (Whispers) Quiet. AEK is here.

Thunder: I'm covering your mouth to stop you from making a sound.

...M950A nods, and Thunder lets go.

AEK-999: ...

M950A: (Whispers) You've really shown up, AEK-999.

...AEK-999 finds a seat and logs on.

...Then it got quiet.

...15 minutes later, everything is still quiet.

Thunder: 950, stop sleeping.

M950A: I wasn't asleep!

M950A: It's about time. She must be pretty preoccupied.

M950A: C'mon, let's see what she's doing!

...M950A and Thunder sneak closer to AEK's seat carefully and start observing.

Thunder: (Whispers) ...I can't see what she's doing.

M950A: Huh? We just have to take a look at her monitor...

M950A: Wait...AEK is...unconscious?

...950 gives AEK a poke. AEK just keeps lying on the chair, completely still.

Thunder: She isn't controlling the machine manually. She's directly plugged her neural cloud in.

M950A: Her consciousness has entered a deeper Level?

M950A: What the hell did TMP tinker this thing into?!

Thunder: Is she training for electronic warfare?

M950A: Impossible. Without the right kind of modification, T-Dolls like us can't handle the stress on our system.

Thunder: But then we can't determine what she's doing.

M950A: Of course we can! Here!

...M950A drags Thunder to the next seat.

M950A: Her connection isn't encrypted. We can simply join the same channel to enter her sector.

M950A: Whether she's actually studying or just chatting and "fishing" online, we'll find out soon enough.

Thunder: Shouldn't we consult the team leader first? I'm worried that...

M950A: What are you worried about? I've been to chat rooms before. They're basically social lounges.

M950A: Nothing more than places where a few people dressed as anime catgirls run around asking for head pats.

Thunder: Is it really that simple?

Thunder: After all, we know practically nothing about where AEK-999 is.

M950A: How crazy can cyberspace be? If AEK can go, I can certainly go, too.

M950A: Besides, I have you with me.

Thunder: Me?

M950A: That's right, I trust you.

M950A: Even if I mess up, we'll be fine together, so I'm not scared at all.

...Thunder falls silent for a while, then she nods.

Thunder: So, shall we begin?

M950A: Yeah, let's get cracking! We must catch AEK-999 slacking off this time!

...M950A and Thunder lie down on their seats and plug themselves in.

Thunder: Ready?

M950A: Yep, let's initiate the connection!

Thunder: Roger.

...Thunder takes a deep breath.

Thunder: Into the Brains!

M950A: What?!

...Buzz!

M950A: Whoa!

...After a bout of dizziness, M950A's consciousness leaves reality and crashes right into cyberspace.

...

...After a long while.

Thunder: M950A...

Thunder: M950A?

M950A: Ugh...

...M950A tries to open her eyes, but her virtual vision hasn't fully recovered.

M950A: Cough...

M950A: I need some rest, Thunder...

Thunder: Same here...

M950A: Seriously, I just can't get used to this without the specialized module...

M950A: We haven't dived that deep, have we? But my neural cloud already feels pretty fried...

Thunder: Well, this isn't exactly our strong suit.

M950A: But...are we there?

Thunder: I guess...we are...?

M950A: You guess? Then where's AEK? Have you seen her?

Thunder: No.

Thunder: It's too crowded here.

M950A: Crowded? You're right...It sounds pretty noisy around us...

M950A: What is this place? Is it a large room?

Thunder: What room...do you mean?

M950A: Huh? I'm obviously talking about—

...M950A's vision slowly returns.

...And she takes in the world before her eyes.

M950A: ...

M950A: Oi...

M950A: What...

M950A: Where—

M950A: WHERE THE HECK ARE WE?!!!

...When M950A and Thunder come to their senses, they find themselves in a massive cybercity.

M950A: W...What the hell is going on?!

M950A: What do we do?! Where the hell are we?! This isn't a chat room!

Thunder: Calm down, 950.

M950A: How can I be calm in a time like this?!

Thunder: Don't worry. All we have to do is find a time machine.

M950A: What time machine? Is this really the time to meme?

Thunder: You understood the reference?

M950A: Hey, I've spent enough time around you clowns.

Thunder: Then...

Thunder: You don't think it's funny?

M950A: Ack...!

M950A: A-At least, I seem to have calmed down... more or less.

M950A: Anyway, let's get outta here first. The people here and this place are simply too odd. We'd better log off and report everything to K2.

Thunder: Yeah...

...M950A and Thunder prepare to disconnect.

M950A: I'm ready. What about you?

M950A: ...

M950A: Uh... Thunder?

Thunder: I can't...

M950A: Huh? What is it?

Thunder: I...can't disconnect.

...M950A looks over and realizes that Thunder really can't leave the current Level.

M950A: What's going on...? Why can't you disconnect...?

M950A: Can't you confirm your original coordinates?

Thunder: Looks like it.

Thunder: Why don't you log off first, 950? Don't worry about me.

M950A: No way, I won't just leave you all alone in this bizarre place.

Thunder: But your mission...

M950A: This is OUR mission! How could I just leave you behind?

M950A: We can get to the bottom of this even with just the two of us.

Thunder: Thanks, 950.

...M950A smiles and pats Thunder on the shoulder.

M950A: We're partners after all. We move together.

...

We roam this strange and fantastical world – this cyberspace that's vastly different than reality with its plethora of bizarre-looking virtual lifeforms.

...All sorts of palm-sized electronic Fairies zoom around the busy streets.

...They seem to be residents of this city. Life beneath the flashing neon lights goes on as usual despite two uninvited guests.

They're definitely aware of us, but nothing's happening. Our appearance and presence don't seem to make a difference.

M950A: Say, there are a lot of these tiny beings. Do they all live here?

M950A: I didn't know so many Fairies live in this world...

Thunder: They look...very happy.

M950A: Ha...I bet it's great not having to work.

M950A: But can Fairies actually be free? Shouldn't they have a master or something...?

Thunder: That's discrimination. You sound exactly like those humans from anti-Doll rights organizations.

M950A: I simply can't picture it. But enough meaningless banter, it's time we get a move on.

Thunder: Where are we going?

M950A: Looking for AEK-999, duh. And finding out where we are.

M950A: After all, this place isn't documented in the system menu. We've gotta figure this out.

Thunder: Where should we start? Should we ask around?

M950A: That's my plan, but the Fairies here are all so weird. I wonder if we can communicate properly...

M950A: Let's try and find someone with a friendly face.

Thunder: What about that one with the rabbit ears over there?

M950A: She's alone. Probably waiting for someone. That'll make it easier to strike up a conversation.

...The two walk over.

M950A: Hello, sorry to disturb you...

M950A: Whoa!

M950A: Are those...guns??!!

M950A: Oh, sorry! It's just a toy. Don't worry!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Are you...from 【ATK】?

M950A: AT...K? What's that?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: This smells fishy...but I'll bear with it...

M950A: You don't have to! We're not bad guys, honestly!

M950A: I was just wondering if you could tell us what this place is.

M950A: Sorry, we accidentally barged in and got a bit confused...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Barged in? Confused? What do you mean?

M950A: Uh...basically, we don't know where to go?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: So...you're lost?

M950A: Exactly! Yes, we're lost! Can you help us?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Where do you want to go?

M950A: Well...I don't know either...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: You're not "lost" if you don't even know where to go, right?

M950A: Ugh...! Can't argue with that...

M950A: Th-Then could you please tell us what this city is?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: This is Pocket City, so I've been told.

M950A: "So I've been told"... Don't you live here?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Sort of? But you tend to forget certain things...

M950A: Pocket City? Never heard of such a place...

M950A: This is 【Black Square】. Do you want to watch a live concert at the 【Clazziquai】?

M950A: Or visit 【Technica】 Street? You'll need to take the 【Miles】 Line...

M950A: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! You just threw in so many strange words I couldn't even make heads or tails of! I don't want to go to those places!

M950A: Then what exactly are you trying to ask me, suspicious little Miss Twintails?

Thunder: Affection levels are reaching a critical low, 950.

M950A: I-I know!

M950A: Okay, I'm looking for a girl. Have you seen her anywhere?

M950A: Kinda short, gray hair, headphones, and a face that's begging to be annihilated by a punch.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: ...Sorry, I haven't seen anyone that fits the description.

M950A: She's our friend, but we got separated. Could you keep an eye out for us?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Someone as suspicious as you? Sure. I'm also looking for someone anyway.

M950A: Who are you looking for? Maybe I can help.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I forgot...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: But I know that I'm looking for him.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Though...he probably isn't coming...

M950A: Is...is that so...?

M950A: If you remember, I'd love to help, Miss Rabbit Ears!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I'm not Miss Rabbit Ears. I have a name.

M950A: Right, so what's your name?

M950A: I forgot...

M950A: Arghhh!!!

M950A: What's the matter with these people?!

Thunder: 950, manners.

M950A: Fine. Then how do we leave this place – this...cyberspace?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: ...What do you mean "leave this place"?

M950A: Uh...you know...leave this place and go back to reality.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Back to reality?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: This...IS reality.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: What else can there be but 【here】?

M950A: Hmm...so you don't know about any other worlds?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Other worlds? What?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: All I know is that...this is 【everything】.

Thunder: It seems that this has turned into a philosophical discussion of cosmic proportions.

Thunder: Sorry, but I have absolutely no idea what you two are talking about.

M950A: That's alright. Is everyone here this...weird?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I'm very ordinary, thank you very much... Why don't you ask the others yourself?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: See, here they come.

M950A: Huh?

...A commotion can be heard in the distance. A group of panicky Fairies come shrieking in fright.

M950A: More funny-looking Fairies! What's happening over there?!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: It's Sangvis Ferri! Sangvis Ferri is here!

M950A: What did you say? Sangvis...Ferri? Here??

...Coming from behind the Fairies are indeed Sangvis forces.

M950A: Wait a minute! What are Sangvis Ferri doing here?!

M950A: Besides, how would YOU know they're S.F.?!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: They're here to capture us! Nobody knows what happened to those they've captured!

M950A: Thunder, draw your weapon. We have to protect the Fairies!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Didn't you say... that those guns were toys?

M950A: Sorry, that was a lie.

M950A: But we really aren't bad guys. Sangvis Ferri are our enemies.

Thunder: Do we engage? But there are a lot of them.

M950A: Still, we can't just let them wreak havoc and snatch whoever they want!

M950A: At the very least, we must give more Fairies cover to evacuate to safety!

M950A: Thunder, we're Griffin T-Dolls, right?!

M950A is after all, such a person.

Thunder: ...Right, I understand.

I hate people like that.

M950A: Thunder, stay behind me and listen to my commands. Get ready!

...

...Bang, bang!

...Suddenly, gunfire from behind M950A completely decimates the Sangvis units charging straight at them.

M950A: Huh?

M950A: Thunder...since when did you boost your firepower?

Thunder: That wasn't me.

Thunder: It came from behind.

K2: ...Is everybody alright?

M950A: L...Leader?? What are you doing here?!

K2: This isn't the time for chit-chat.

K2: My echelon will fend off the Sangvis troops. I'm leaving it to you to cover the Fairies. Is that okay?

M950A: Got it! Leave it to us!

M950A: But where should we evacuate them?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I...I can help!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I hang around here pretty often as I wait for someone. I know where it'll be safe!

M950A: Then please!

M950A: Guys! You heard that?!

M950A: 【ATK】 is here to save us! Follow me to the usual place!

M950A: What exactly is this 【ATK】 that you just mentioned...?

M950A: Never mind, leave that for later. Where are you going?!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: There's a bar called 【Hot Tunes】 in the city center. That's our temporary shelter!

M950A: Right, then I'll cover your retreat!

Thunder: You've become really dependable all of a sudden, 950.

M950A: Huh? Say, don't treat me like an idiot. I've been your vice-leader for quite a while, okay?

M950A: Goody-goody K2 can't handle you bunch of free-range critters on your own, you know!

K2: Um...sorry, but I heard that...

Thunder: Congratulations.

M950A: Be serious! We're getting everyone outta here!

M950A: Take care of the Sangvis forces, Leader K2!

K2: Don't worry, leave it all to me!

K2: But right now there are still too many Fairies around. We can't go all out and can only fend them off!

K2: Escort the Fairies off the scene and stay back. Don't come out until I'm finished with them, alright?

K2: Finally, I'm here again...

K2: I won't ever let you hurt any of my friends!

K2: Sangvis thugs, get the hell out of this city!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Combat over.

...Sangvis Ferri has been pushed back to the perimeters of the city. M950A and Thunder seize the opportunity and escort the Fairies into the bar.

M950A: I-Is everything over and settled?

Thunder: It was a big victory, 950.

M950A: Ha, piece of cake. All we did was lead everyone into the bar.

Thunder: Made easy thanks to the team leader.

M950A: Ha, K2, you're right on time—

M950A: K2? Hey, K2??

M950A: Strange, why isn't she responding...?

Thunder: Comms are functional and all Sangvis troops have withdrawn.

Thunder: Conclusion – there shouldn't have been an accident.

M950A: True, but then what happened? She just appeared and disappeared without warning...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Hey, everybody's safely inside the bar. Come on in!

...M950A leads Thunder into the bar.

M950A: This looks familiar. I've seen something like this back at HQ—

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: 【ATK】 is back! Go and welcome them!

M950A: Huh?! W-What...

...M950A and Thunder find themselves surrounded by a bunch of Fairies in a partying mood.

M950A: Uh, thanks...

Thunder: Where did your decorum go, 950?

M950A: I-I'm just a bit startled!

M950A: And the 【ATK】you just mentioned...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: You defeated Sangvis Ferri and saved us all, so you must be a member of 【ATK】!

M950A: 【ATK】? What the hell is that?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Huh? You honestly don't know?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: And here I thought you were their new recruits...

M950A: Please explain this 【ATK】 to me...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Whenever Sangvis Ferri attacks, this mysterious 【ATK】 will come to our rescue!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Cat Warrior sniffs out the scent of danger, Black Rider clears the way with her steed, and Windtalker summons an army to destroy the enemies!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: They're the saviors of 【Pocket City】!

M950A: Is 【ATK】 some sort of organization?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: That's right! 【ATK】 is like the NB Rangers – a battle organization that requires team coordination!

M950A: NB Rangers? I have no idea who they are either...

M950A: Anyway, we probably aren't from this ATK or whatever, but it's our pleasure to be of help.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: That's fine! You protected us in 【Pocket City】, and we're all very grateful!

M950A: Oh, don't mention it.

M950A: By the way...what are they doing back there?

...The Fairies are all gathered into groups, some decorating the room, some fiddling with the music player in the corner.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: We're getting ready for a break.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: We've done a lot of running. Music is the only thing that can restore our energy.

M950A: Listening to music to recuperate? Interesting.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Don't you do the same to feel better?

Thunder: Our recovery is more like "cling-clang crack-crackle".

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: That sounds painful...

M950A: It's not so bad, though your way seems pretty nice too.

M950A: Oh, is it done already?

...In the blink of an eye, the whole room has been transformed into a wintry, festive mood.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The music is about to begin. Oh, take these and join us!

...Rabbit-Ears hand them a music player and a pair of old, battered earphones.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Sorry. These things have been here for a long time. Most of them have seen better days.

M950A: That's alright. It's perfectly fine for the two of us...

M950A: Do I turn it on like this?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Are you ready? Judging by the décor, it's probably gonna be that song.

M950A: "That song"?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: This one, duh.

...

...The bustling Fairies all fall silent and settle down on the bar table and chairs.

...M950A also stops asking questions and just lets the melody flow through Thunder and herself.

M950A: ...

M950A: ...That's something.

Thunder: Yeah.

At that moment, my ears and my heart have awakened.

I finally understand that this is what I want...

...What I really want to do.

M950A: (Whispers) Come to think of it...

M950A: Why are there plushies of IDW here...?

Thunder: Both Sangvis Ferri and Griffin seem to be active here.

M950A: Humph, what a strange place.

Thunder: But I want to stay.

M950A: Are you sure?

Thunder: This is a place where you can simply live – no fighting, no getting hurt.

M950A: Is that what you think?

M950A: Be careful what you wish for though, or you might never be able to wake up from this.

Thunder: But...

Thunder: Even if I end up staying here forever, someone will come along and replace me in reality.

M950A: But this Thunder I'm talking to is one-of-a-kind and completely irreplaceable to me, partner.

Thunder: What about the next Thunder?

M950A: That'll probably be someone else...I guess.

Thunder: ...So you're not sure?

M950A: I don't know. I haven't lost you yet, have I?

Thunder: True...

M950A: Still, if you stay, I can't watch your back.

Thunder: ...I know.

Thunder: Fighting is our life, I know that...

Thunder: I just can't help but wonder...who lives a happier life, us or these Fairies.

M950A: Do you have the answer?

Thunder: Obviously not.

M950A: Perhaps those who don't know are the happiest.

Thunder: Nonsense.

Thunder: Still...I'm sorry, 950.

Thunder: Even I don't know...why I'm talking about such things...

M950A: It's probably the music here...

M950A: Our neural clouds are somehow affected...

M950A: Or should I say...opened...

Thunder: You think so? Like how humans feel...their heartbeat?

M950A: This cyber world isn't reality, and we're nothing but guests here...

M950A: Maybe...wait...

...The break seems to be coming to an end. The music slowly drifts away and disappears like smoke.

M950A: Thunder...

M950A: Maybe this is why AEK keeps running away!

Thunder: What?

M950A: The thoughts you've been having. AEK... is trying to put them into action.

Thunder: Leaving us and keeping her neural cloud here forever?

M950A: That's right, escaping to another world...forever...

M950A: After all, this kind of lifestyle does seem to suit her.

Thunder: No matter what, we can't let her go.

M950A: Yeah... of course not!

M950A: At least I won't let her do this. Neglecting one's duties is highly irresponsible.

M950A: Besides... us T-Dolls can't actually be repaired by music. Listening to music all day will just get boring for us.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Listening to music wasn't all we would ever do.

M950A: Oh, you're still here.

M950A: That was a really nice song. What's it called?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I don't remember.

M950A: What? You don't even remember the name of the song?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Yeah...none of us remember the names of these songs. We only pick what to play randomly.

M950A: Is that so... Well, as long as it sounds good!

M950A: Here, thanks for your earphones and music player.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Keep them as a present. We still have loads.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: After all...there's no one left to use them...

M950A: What do you mean?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The Fairies in 【Pocket City】...are getting captured by Sangvis Ferri one after the other.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Listening to these songs left behind by our friends is the only way we can spend our days.

M950A: Even you have your own problems...

M950A: But I don't know how to help you. Sorry.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: That's fine. But are you...really from the outside world?

M950A: According to our understanding, yes.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The outside world... So it really does exist?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I didn't dare believe it... It turns out...that the rumors are true!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Are people in the outside world...still listening to our songs?

M950A: Songs? ...I'm not too sure about that.

M950A: So can you finally tell me where the gray-haired girl is?

M950A: I believe she's a member of this 【ATK】 that you mentioned?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Hey, how do you know that?

M950A: You asked me if I was an 【ATK】 member because of my weapon, didn't you?

M950A: Besides, the girl we're looking for is called AEK-999. I'm guessing her name probably has something to do with ATK...

M950A: ...What, Thunder?

...Thunder tugs M950A's blouse lightly for a brief moment.

Thunder: ...950.

Thunder: So you're actually pretty smart.

M950A: What the hell...? Somehow that compliment doesn't sound flattering at all!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: She's Black Rider from 【ATK】...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Why are you looking for her?

M950A: She's our friend, but she's been slacking on her job recently. That's why we came to see what she's up to.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I'm so sorry. I didn't tell you the truth because I was suspicious of your motive.

M950A: AEK-999 is my teammate. I'm only here to find her.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Alright... Then I'll tell you what you want to know.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The lady with gray hair did come...

M950A: That's great! Ha, I finally have you, AEK-999!

M950A: Do you know where she is now?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: She said she's going to...uh...

...Rabbit-Ears makes a face.

M950A: Well? Go on.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The 【Graveyard】...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: She said she's going to the 【Graveyard】...

Thunder: What's that?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The 【Graveyard】 is a rumor. No one knows where exactly it is...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Actually, we aren't even sure it even exists.

M950A: Then AEK knows where this Graveyard is? And why is she going there?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: She said she'd find it.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: She wanted to go there because legend has it...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: The Master of 【Pocket City】 is buried in the 【Graveyard】.

M950A: Master?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: We don't know who this Master is. In any case, she has never awakened.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Perhaps...there had never been such a person, and she was nothing more than a myth...

M950A: Now it makes sense... AEK wants to go to this so-called 【Graveyard】...

M950A: But where do we start looking?

M950A: There are only the two of us. If only we have more people here...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Um...why don't you ask her over there?

M950A: What?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: She's also a member of 【ATK】.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: You probably know her, too?

...The Fairy with rabbit ears points at someone near the crowd.

M950A: Huh? That's...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: That's the most mysterious member of 【ATK】 – Cat Warrior!

...M950A and Thunder look in the direction and see a mysterious-looking girl wrapped in a coat.

...Only she isn't mysterious at all to them.

TMP: ...

M950A: ...

TMP: ...

M950A: TMP...

TMP: ...!

M950A: What...are you doing here...?

M950A: Huhhhhhh??!

...TMP has been spotted!

M950A: You! What are you doing here?!

M950A: Spill!

...Flustered, TMP turns and makes a run for it!

M950A: Don't run! Stop right there! Now!

Thunder: She ran off. What do we do?

M950A: We go after her, duh! Hurry!

M950A: Please make way! Excuse me!

...M950A and Thunder push through the crowd in pursuit of TMP.

...Rabbit-Ears' voice comes shouting from behind.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: We'll be waiting for you here!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Don't forget to come back for our party!

M950A: Thanks! See you later!

M950A: TMP, stop running! Don't you dare take another step!

TMP: ...!

...TMP keeps running without even looking back, her cat ears flopping with every stride.

TMP: ...!

M950A: TMP! You won't get away from us!

Thunder: But she already has!

M950A: Evasion is her forte. Catching her in a speed race isn't the way!

M950A: Let's split up and cut her off! Thunder, you take the left!

...M950A and Thunder separate for a pincer attack!

TMP: ...!

Thunder: Stop right there. You can't make it.

Thunder: No one gets past my bullets.

TMP: Th-Thunder...

TMP: Why are the two of you here as well?!

Thunder: Want to know the reason?

TMP: As if I care! You can't catch me!

...TMP turns and bolts!

M950A: Humph, I've been waiting for you!

M950A: Justice from the Heavens!

...Thunk!

TMP: Whoa!!

...M950A leaps down from above and has TMP pinned down.

M950A: Phew...

M950A: Gotcha, TMP.

TMP: Ugh...

...TMP lies in a heap on the ground, stars dancing before her eyes.

M950A: You...are the 【T】 in 【ATK】, aren't you?

TMP: Ugh...

M950A: Answer me!

M950A: You're always hanging around AEK-999!

M950A: You must be involved in this, right?!

TMP: We...we're doing it for this cyber city...

M950A: That's too dangerous! You should've sent this case to FAL!

M950A: Now tell me where AEK-999 has gone!

TMP: I...I don't know. I'm also looking for her...

M950A: Huh? You think I'd believe that?! Hurry up and tell me, or—

M950A: I'm gonna confiscate all your merch in your dorm once we get back!

TMP: No! I honestly don't know! Miss K2, save me!

M950A: K2?? What are you—

...Thunder taps M950A on the shoulder and points behind her.

...M950A looks back and finds K2 standing right there.

K2: ...Hi.

K2: I...uh...

K2: I'm here to warn you that we have trouble incoming.

M950A: Huh?

...A mechanical whir can be heard from a distance.

Thunder: Sangvis Ferri is here again.

TMP: They've been coming more frequently all of a sudden!

K2: (Sighs) All thanks to you lot.

K2: Didn't I tell you not to run off while I was busy clearing them out?

K2: Now the streets are crawling with your Griffin signals. Of course they're making a beeline for you.

M950A: But...

K2: I know we owe you a lot of explanation.

K2: But right now...

K2: Cover me while I finish off their assault forces.

M950A: You have a way?

K2: This cyber world is very malleable.

K2: It's easy to summon echelons from the database to fight for us!

TMP: Thanks to me!

Thunder: Are you entering "Temperature Mode"?

K2: It's "Fever Mode"!

K2: Rally up and get through this together. We'll save the talking for later.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Combat over. All Sangvis units in the streets have been eliminated.

TMP: Phew...that was close.

TMP: It's finally over.

Thunder: Congratulations on your outstanding performance, Leader K2.

K2: That wasn't too bad. This world is on a relatively shallow Level, so the stress on the command module is minimal.

K2: If it had been in real life or standard electronic warfare, my neural cloud would probably be pretty scrambled by now.

M950A: ...

M950A: Now tell us, K2.

M950A: Why exactly are you here...?

K2: Well...

M950A: Ah...of course you'd be here.

M950A: After all, we were saved by the echelon under your command...

M950A: Which makes you...

K2: The 【K】 in 【ATK】.

K2: Actually, that's just a silly name the Fairies came up for us.

K2: Sorry, M950A and Thunder, for keeping you in the dark this whole time. It's a little awkward now, haha...

M950A: It's not funny!

M950A: How...how could you do this?!

M950A: Arghhhhhh! You make us look like idiots!

K2: I'm so sorry, 950. We didn't mean to keep secrets...

M950A: Then what is the meaning of this?!

M950A: My dear team leader runs off on adventures to an alternate universe with her teammates while I try to play role model like a moron, is that it?!

K2: We'll explain later. I take responsibility for everything, 950.

K2: But right now, the most important thing is to find AEK.

M950A: AEK...where the hell has she gone?

K2: TMP has been trying to find her, but...

TMP: I found her rough location.

K2: Huh? Really?

TMP: Yeah!

TMP: I found it...

TMP: The rumors are real!

Thunder: What's real?

TMP: The 【Graveyard】...

TMP: The hidden 【Graveyard】 in 【Pocket City】... I found it!

M950A: What?!

M950A: You say you found the 【Graveyard】?!

TMP: But-but it's all ruined, thanks to you!

TMP: I was tailing the two Fairies...but you spotted me at the bar!

M950A: The two Fairies? Which two Fairies?

TMP: Oh yeah, they were retreating with you!

TMP: I've been digging around for a long time and apparently they're the only ones who know that the 【Graveyard】 actually exists!

TMP: It's all your fault it's all your fault it's all your fault!

...TMP flaps her long sleeves at M950A.

M950A: Argh! Stop it!

M950A: What's that got to do with me?! You were trying to run!

TMP: Because you scared me!

TMP: Now I've lost the lead. What are you gonna—

??: Greetings.

...Everyone turns to the voice.

Fairy twins: Are you...

Fairy twins: ...looking for us, by any chance?

...The four Dolls follow the Fairy twins toward the 【Graveyard】.

M950A: These two fairies...don't talk at all.

TMP: They don't make a sound no matter what you ask them. They're just like Thunder.

Thunder: ...I do make a sound.

Thunder: Listen.

...Thunder releases the safety on her gun.

TMP: Ugh...alright, alright. Don't go crazy.

M950A: It doesn't matter if they talk or not, so long as they take us to the graveyard.

M950A: However, Leader, you'd better come clean now.

M950A: What exactly is going on here, and how did you discover this world?

...K2 falls silent for a while, then lets out a sigh.

K2: Fine. I suppose it's better to tell you everything now...

K2: It all started because of me.

K2: Back when we first got here, I stumbled across this world while I was looking through the database that TMP recovered in the arcade.

M950A: But why did you interfere with the world? Did you have to go that far being a busy-body do-gooder?

K2: I did it because of Sangvis Ferri.

K2: The S.F. in this world were derived from the data in the Griffin database.

K2: In other words, our world accidentally converged with this one and created a threat.

M950A: Then why didn't you just report this to HQ?

K2: Because I got curious.

K2: I have memories of this world in my neural cloud.

K2: I wanted to find out more about this place...

M950A: Why...would you have memories...

K2: This world did exist in real life.

K2: These Fairies and their music created a lot of precious memories for humans 50 years ago.

K2: As for why I remember...I suppose it has something to do with my ancestry...

M950A: So you found this place and decided to help clear out S.F. to correct your mistakes, right?

K2: That's how it started, and I enlisted TMP to assist me since she also knew about it.

K2: But soon we realized that there's no end to the Sangvis Ferri infestation here.

K2: For some reason, they regenerate extremely quickly. I wanted to give up and hand this case over to HQ...

M950A: But you didn't give up. You came tonight, didn't you?

TMP: All because of you! And AEK-999...

TMP: She promised me she wouldn't come back. Why did she...

M950A: Then how did AEK-999 get involved in this?

K2: She came across this world on her own and sneaked in behind our backs.

K2: When we found out about the truth, we told her we're never going in again and she should also stay away, but...

M950A: But she sneaked in again today.

M950A: And this time...she doesn't plan on leaving...

TMP: Huh?! What makes you think that?

M950A: Is that not true?

TMP: K2 also shares your suspicion, but I don't believe it!

TMP: AEK doesn't always do as she's told, but she definitely isn't someone who'd put play before work!

M950A: I didn't believe it either, but I have a feeling...

M950A: ...that staying in this world for too long will affect our neural cloud.

K2: You noticed that too, 950? If we hand this over to FAL, AEK will be punished for staying here.

K2: So we must sort this out quickly. Find AEK and bring her home ASAP!

M950A: For the record, I am not happy that you did all this without telling Thunder or me...

M950A: Not. Happy!

K2: I know... I'm really sorry, 950. I mean it. I'll reflect on this when I get back.

K2: All I wanted was to settle this alone, but I ended up dragging everybody in...

K2: Maybe...I'm not really a good team leader.

TMP: You don't have to apologize, K2. This whole business is beyond our understanding.

M950A: Ha! Weren't you the one who created this mess to begin with?!

TMP: I...was just doing my job!

M950A: Huh?! I don't believe you! You always make unnecessary trouble out of nothing!

M950A: If you hadn't bolted just now, we wouldn't have wasted so much time!

TMP: I told you – you were really scary—

TMP: Ow! Ow! Don't pull my ears!

M950A: Hey, aren't those headphones?! Why would they hurt?!

TMP: I had them modified! I was just...trying to—

M950A: What were you trying to do?! Freak! Furry! Closet perv!

TMP: N-no-no, that's not what I meant! Let go!

K2: Stop bullying TMP.

K2: Have we...arrived?

...The Fairy twins come to a stop and stare blankly ahead.

...

M950A: You're right...

M950A: This does look like a graveyard, doesn't it?

K2: It seems to have been locked up for a long time.

...K2 touches the gate, and it flings open with a creak.

...The twins fly on, and everyone follows suit to explore the Graveyard.

TMP: It's huge. How long have we been walking now...?

TMP: Is AEK really in here?

K2: I don't think anyone has been here. Let alone AEK...

M950A: Huh? Then where did she go?! We've lost all our leads!

TMP: Something...doesn't feel right about this place.

K2: This is a graveyard. Of course it feels off.

TMP: The texts on these tombstones don't seem to be names.

M950A: What else can they be?

Fairy twins: No...

Thunder: Hush... The Fairies have something to say.

...The twins suddenly turn around.

Fairy twins: ...People aren't the only ones that die.

Fairy twins: Even things that aren't alive...can die...

Fairy twins: If we're all completely forgotten...

Fairy twins: We'll die...

M950A: What did you say?

M950A: And what are you?

Fairy twins: We...are memories that don't want to die...

K2: Memories...

K2: Are you...really...

Fairy twins: This is the farthest we can lead you.

...Rumble...rumble...

...The earth starts rippling beneath their feet.

Fairy twins: Now, please enjoy this city's hospitality.

M950A: Hospitality...?

Fairy twins: We look forward to seeing you survive the end of the moonlight.

...The Fairy twins vanish into thin air.

Thunder: 950...did you hear that?

Lazy female voice: Humph...

Lazy female voice: Are the tributes finally here?

M950A: Something...is vibrating...

...M950A rummages in her pocket.

Thunder: The earphones...and music player are glowing.

Lazy female voice: I've been looking for so long. I didn't expect you to just show up...

Lazy female voice: It's probably just a coincidence, but that's fate, I suppose.

Lazy female voice: Now, can I finally have what's mine?

M950A: Noises are coming from the ground!

??: Grumble...rumble...

Thunder: Something is coming out!

Figures draped in shadow start crawling out from the earth.

K2: Watch out! Stay together!

M950A: What the heck are those?!

M950A: This is ridiculous even in cyberspace!

TMP: Wraiths...

TMP: Legend has it...the Fairies that got captured by Sangvis Ferri...

TMP: ...would eventually turn into wraiths, trapped forever in the night, roaming and wailing in the moonlight...

M950A: You sure did your research.

M950A: I feel kinda sorry for them, but we'll have to fight back if they attack us!

K2: No matter who is responsible for this, we can't be sitting ducks!

K2: So it's going to be a fight.

K2: By the by...I hope nobody here is afraid of ghosts?

M950A: I'm not scared of anything that bullets can kill.

M950A: What about you, Thunder?

Thunder: I find them pretty cool. Worry about TMP.

TMP: Whoa! They're coming! They're coming this way!

TMP: Is it too late to log off?!

K2: Did you forget that we can't actually log off?

M950A: Even you...?

K2: That's right, we can't log off either no matter how many times we've tried.

TMP: Ugh... I have no idea what's gone wrong, but looks like we have no choice but get through this!

...Rumble...grumble...

M950A: Hey, there's too many of them!

M950A: Can we even handle them?!

K2: If you can log off, feel free to backup your neural cloud first.

M950A: Heh, what a crappy night. I don't wanna be the only one to come out of this alive.

M950A: I have to get my hands real dirty, or AEK will make fun of me for being a sissy!

K2: Right, then here we go!

K2: We've got to make it out of this graveyard alive!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The battle comes to an end. Almost all wraiths have been destroyed.

K2: Just those left! They're running away!

TMP: They know how to do that? But they don't look like sentient AI!

Thunder: They might be under someone's control.

M950A: We can't let them go! Leave them to me!

...M950A catches up with the last two wraiths and cuts them off in front of a large tombstone covered in graffiti.

...The two wraiths are trapped, with no ways to escape.

M950A: "R.I.P..." I've seen that logo before...

M950A: Gee, you can barely see what's written on it through all that graffiti. Did something happen here in the past...?

Thunder: Aren't you gonna kill them?

M950A: Of course I am.

M950A: Sorry, I don't care what you were...I can't let you escape.

M950A: Farewell—

??: Wait!

...Just as M950A pulls the trigger, she's pushed to the side.

...Her bullet brushes past the wraith and hits the tombstone.

M950A: Whoa! What the hell?! Are you—

M950A: ...Huh?

M950A: AE...K?

AEK-999: ...Heh.

AEK-999: That was close, wasn't it?

K2: AEK!

...AEK-999 walks up to the two wraiths.

AEK-999: Here are your lost items. I found them.

...AEK-999 holds out two tiny cheerleading pom poms.

M950A: Hey, AEK! What on earth...

...AEK-999 gestures at M950A to keep quiet.

AEK-999: Now, wake up!

...Suddenly, the wraiths are wrapped in a cocoon of light.

...Then, they start changing.

Thunder: Those are...

...Two Fairies emerge from the light.

Idol Fairies: Ugh...

Idol Fairies: Have you come to rescue us, Lord Rider?

AEK-999: I told you I'm not a lord...

AEK-999: But I did promise to save you, though I was a bit late.

...AEK-999 finally turns around.

AEK-999: Good evening, guys! What are y'all doing here?

M950A: Huh? Looking for you, duh!

TMP: AEK! Are you alright? Where on earth have you been?!

AEK-999: Haha, sorry if I made you worry.

AEK-999: These are the Fairy friends that I made a while ago. They got captured by Sangvis Ferri so I came to rescue them.

Idol Fairies: I knew Lord Black Rider and her friends were going to save us! Thank you so much!

M950A: Black Rider? Playing cool even in a place like this?

AEK-999: I was spotted biking around the Black Square.

AEK-999: They wanted to call me Sunset Rider or something, but I don't like that name because the song isn't my style!

Thunder: Song? Name? What...

AEK-999: Oh? You found out about that already?

AEK-999: That's right, they got captured because they remembered their names.

Idol Fairies: My name is Sehra, and this is my twin sister Nina.

K2: Not that we can tell you apart...

AEK-999: Sehra is the one in pink, Nina's in blue.

AEK-999: Thanks for opening the Graveyard. I couldn't have saved them before their memories got wiped otherwise.

AEK-999: Now that I've completed my mission, let's go home.

Thunder: Aren't you...trying to stay here?

AEK-999: Huh? Stay here?

AEK-999: Why would I want to do that?

TMP: I told you AEK would never do something like that!

K2: Sorry, AEK. We thought you...

AEK-999: Hey, am I really such an irresponsible prick to you?

AEK-999: And 950, don't always make a bad person outta me.

M950A: But you lied to me, didn't you?! You even said you were accumulating human experience or something!

AEK-999: Uh...well, I WAS learning. About music.

M950A: Tsk! Of course I'd misunderstand you if you never tell me the truth!

AEK-999: Still, when I was in the bar, a voice did try to tempt me to stay in this world forever.

AEK-999: I don't know who that was, but I rejected it!

Lazy female voice: Oh? You were just telling me...that it was an interesting idea...

M950A: That's the voice!

AEK-999: You...heard it too? That's it. That's her.

Thunder: The tombstone. The tombstone is speaking...

Thunder: Or something inside is...

AEK-999: It can't be...

AEK-999: Can that voice...be heard all the way in the bar?

TMP: It can...

TMP: If...she's the Master of 【Pocket City】...

That's right, if I am...the Master of 【Pocket City】...

The question is...am I?

K2: Careful! It's...coming out!

??: What exactly am I?

??: S?

??: A?

??: B?

??: C?

??: Or Fail?!

??: I'll let you rate me!

...BOOM!

...The whole graveyard is engulfed in violent tremors and rumblings. The large tombstone explodes in blinding light, forcing everyone to squint!

AEK-999: Hey! What the hell is that?!

M950A: Stay close and ready your weapons!

...The light gradually subsides.

TMP: Someone is standing on the tombstone!

...They all look up.

??: ...

??: Hello, everybody!

??: Ladies and Players!

??: Have you missed me?

...

??: Ladies and Players!

??: Have you missed me?

M950A: Who...

M950A: Who the hell are you?!

??: Call me Miss El Fail.

??: I'm the only person with a name in 【Pocket City】.

??: That is to say...

??: I'm the Master of 【Pocket City】.

K2: What's your evil plan? Tell us!

M950A: That's right, then we'll fight you and put a stop to everything!

El Fail: Say, do you always solve problems with violence?

El Fail: Here in 【Pocket City】, music is the way to go.

TMP: You're lying! You're the one...who summoned those Sangvis Ferri, aren't you?!

K2: Huh? You think so?

El Fail: You've got a great sense of intuition, Miss Cat Warrior.

El Fail: I modified this place with the data I borrowed from you.

El Fail: More and more Fairies are getting...unstable, so I have to "re-educate" them.

M950A: ...

M950A: What do you mean..."re-educate"?

El Fail: Taking away their names, of course!

Thunder: ...!

El Fail: Their names, the names of their songs, and their raison d'être...

El Fail: I have them brought here and remove all these unnecessary things.

K2: Why?! Why are you doing this?!

El Fail: Why? We have no need for such things here in 【Pocket City】.

El Fail: We don't need to know who each other is, where the songs come from, or why we live.

El Fail: All we have to do is enjoy the melodies. Isn't that the purpose of music? Isn't that happiness?

M950A: El Fail, you said...

M950A: You've tampered with everyone's memory. Don't tell me...even the Fairy that we talked to...

M950A: Even her memory...

El Fail: But of course. All the Fairies in 【Pocket City】 have had their memories wiped at least once.

El Fail: Problem is, things come back to them every now and then, so I'll have to do it all over again.

El Fail: Recently, this has been happening more and more frequently. For the sake of everyone's happiness, I've been working really hard every night, you know.

M950A: This isn't happiness!

M950A: How can anyone be happy when they can't remember their name or whom they're waiting for?!

El Fail: My... Nothing matters once you forget it, isn't that right?

M950A: But that's not for you to decide!

El Fail: Who is it up to then? This cold, fickle world?

El Fail: Ancestry, place of birth, family, what others think of you, public opinion, natural disasters, traffic accidents, war, the scope of tomorrow's exam, the lottery numbers next week...how many of these are for you to decide?

El Fail: Don't be fooled by reality's illusions. Happiness isn't something you can fight for, Miss Doll.

K2: So what are you doing?

K2: You're taking others' memories to satisfy your own ego!

El Fail: I told you, I'm doing this to make everyone happy. Only when they're happy can I be happy. This is how I live as their Master.

AEK-999: What are illusions, what's reality – that's for people to experience and decide for themselves!

TMP: That's right! Even if I spend my time daydreaming about nonsense, I don't need someone else to dictate how I think!

Thunder: Did you just casually bring up your personal fetish?

TMP: Ack...

El Fail: See? The start of trouble.

AEK-999: But this is also how new discoveries are made!

AEK-999: People like you have no soul and can never make new music!

El Fail: New discoveries? Nothing is new in Pocket City, nor do we need new things.

El Fail: Things are perfect the way they are. No rules, no opinions. Everyone can be happy without having to think about anything.

El Fail: At the end of the day, you're artificial creations just like us. Who are you to talk about free will?

K2: How pitiful. At least I know I can make choices.

El Fail: ...

El Fail: Sorry, but soon you won't be able to.

El Fail: Now that you're here in this world, you'll have to accept my doctrine and become one of us.

Thunder: Have you...also tampered with our neural clouds?

El Fail: What do you think? Do you know...why you haven't been able to leave?

所有人形: ...?!

AEK-999: What? Even you guys—

TMP: N-no way! Is that your doing?

El Fail: That's how things are.

El Fail: Everything is just meaningless fragments. Nothing is too perfect to be excised.

El Fail: But I'm not thorough enough with the surgeries...

El Fail: Still, now that I've obtained a new form and recovered all of my power...

El Fail: It's time to remedy that... None of you can possibly resist the thought of absolute freedom.

...El Fail hops off the tombstone.

K2: We won't let you get away with it! You can't beat us!

El Fail: Who says I'm trying to beat you?

El Fail: I simply want to make you happy...as your Master.

AEK-999: Here she comes!

...El Fail raises her star-shaped weapon.

El Fail: Calm down, my friends.

El Fail: What you need is a song to help you relax!

AEK-999: ...Watch out!

TMP: Whoa!

...The Graveyard is suddenly immersed in an eerie light that has drowned out the moon and everyone present.

...

......

...Knock, knock!

...Knock, knock, knock!

Thunder: ...

Thunder: Where...am I?

...Knock, knock, knock, knock!

...Someone is knocking on the door.

M950A: Open up, dorm inspection! Hurry!

...Ka-chak.

Thunder: Good morning, M950A.

M950A: You took your sweet time. Were you still in bed?!

Thunder: I...

Thunder: Sorry, M950A.

Thunder: I wasn't sure if I should open the door.

M950A: Huh? What are you talking about?

Thunder: AEK told me this morning...

Thunder: ...to fire a shot in the corridor if you're here. My gunshot is really loud so she'll definitely hear it.

M950A: Uh... Why does she need to hear it...?

M950A: Wait, is she not in the dorm?

Thunder: She's in the electronic entertainment room. Slacking.

M950A: Uh...

M950A: So...AEK made you a collaborator?

M950A: Strange. You're...surprisingly candid today.

Thunder: I don't know why...

Thunder: But it feels as if my neural cloud has been...pried open.

Thunder: So you aren't mad?

M950A: Why would I be mad? You're being honest with me.

Thunder: Don't you hate me now, 950?

Thunder: You trust me, yet I...helped AEK do bad things...

M950A: Hmm...why would I hate you...?

M950A: Do you hate me, Thunder?

Thunder: Of course not.

M950A: Really?

Thunder: I really like you, 950.

Thunder: You've always had faith in me. Not everyone does.

Thunder: So you really don't hate me?

M950A: How could I possibly hate you?

M950A: The one I hate...

M950A: The one I hate...is myself.

Thunder: ...

AEK-999: Thunder, close your mind! Now!

AEK-999: Or El Fail will have control over us! Don't trust anyone!

Thunder: AEK?

AEK-999: Sehra and Nina told me! I'm trying to throw El Fail off my tail!

AEK-999: Hang in there for a bit! We'll get you out soon, so wait for us!

...AEK's voice fades away.

Thunder: Just now, that sounded like...

M950A: What did you hear?

Thunder: I...

...The klaxon goes off all of a sudden.

Thunder: What's going on?

M950A: An alarm! Enemies incoming!

...

Thunder: Wait, where are the others?

M950A: What others?

Thunder: K2, AEK-999, TMP, and other T-Dolls...

M950A: Do they matter?

Thunder: ...Very much.

M950A: Even more than me?

Thunder: Certainly.

Thunder: Because you aren't really M950A.

M950A: ...

M950A: How did you realize that?

Thunder: I like 950. She's always certain that she's doing the right thing.

Thunder: There isn't much interaction between us, but through her words and actions, she's always guiding me, a Doll who doesn't really have a mind of her own.

Thunder: I believe...that someone like her won't hate herself.

M950A: Is that so...?

M950A: How astute. I expected nothing less, Thunder.

M950A: Still...I still think we should set off.

Thunder: Why?

M950A: We can't part until the dream has run its course. You can't get away now.

M950A: Besides...I don't want to be left behind in a place crawling with Sangvis Ferri.

M950A: If you go, it'll drive me crazy even if it doesn't kill me.

Thunder: So I have no choice but to live through the whole thing?

M950A: Or you can end it with a single bullet.

Thunder: No.

Thunder: I want to see what you're like walking a different path.

M950A: Sure. Think of it as sharing a dream with me...

M950A: Even if it isn't real, I hope you'll walk with me till the very end.

Thunder: ...Alright.

Thunder: Let's go. Eliminate the Sangvis forces and win.

Thunder: So that I can wake from this false dream.
Part 2

...Combat over.

M950A: We won, Thunder.

M950A: There's neither Sangvis Ferri nor Griffin here.

M950A: This world only belongs to the two of us.

Thunder: ...

M950A: Do you like such a world, Thunder?

M950A: No one hates you anymore, and no one will ever pick on you for having a poker face.

M950A: I know how hard it is for you to express your feelings. This must be the world you've been wishing for!

Thunder: But I don't want to stay.

M950A: Why?

M950A: Because I'm not real?

Thunder: Because I can't live here.

Thunder: I know I'm useless...I think too much and I'm not good with words. I'm always two steps behind everyone else.

Thunder: But I've got to try my best to adapt, not run away.

M950A: Do you really mean that, Thunder...?

M950A: What's so good about a world like that?!

Thunder: Nothing, but that's the only world in which I'll grow...

Thunder: Until I can catch up with them...950 and my other teammates...

Thunder: I won't hide in a dream. I won't hide behind 950 or anyone else.

M950A: ...

Thunder: Because 950 once said that I have to change my own mind.

Thunder: This adventure has made me realize that I have to do this. I have to be strong for you...

Thunder: So that no matter what kind of danger arises...

M950A: Thunder...

Thunder: I'm sorry, but that's why I have to wake up, no matter the cost...

...M950A smiles, and the world before their eyes start crumbling like cracked eggshells.

M950A: Well done, Thunder.

M950A: You passed the test.

Thunder: Huh?

M950A: I was going to take you with me.

M950A: But it appears that won't be necessary.

...The ground starts collapsing under Thunder's feet.

M950A: Ah...it's time to say goodbye...

...M950A walks closer to Thunder.

Thunder: What?

...M950A gives Thunder a push, and Thunder tumbles into the pure white swirl of emptiness along with the broken pieces of the world.

Thunder: Wait, 950!

Thunder: Don't tell me...!

...M950A's voice echoes in the shattered world.

M950A: That's right, it's really me...

M950A: I'm the real M950A.

M950A: It was only for a second, but I did...truly hate myself.

M950A is exactly that kind of person.

I hate people like that.

I hate...myself for being like this.

Thunder: ...!

M950A: I've given it a lot of thought – what would I be like if I weren't burdened by my duty...

M950A: If I didn't have friends, or you...

M950A: I'm sorry, Thunder, but the M950A that you believe in...isn't the real me.

Thunder: No...that's not true!

Thunder: The M950A I'm talking to isn't the real you either! Come back, 950!

M950A: But I've chosen this path. I'm sorry...

Thunder: ...

M950A: It's been my fault this whole time, Thunder. Everything I lived by...has been a mistake.

Thunder: You're not wrong, 950!

Thunder: Close your mind! El Fail is trying to hack you!

M950A: What if this is the moment I've been looking forward to?

M950A: I'm willing to accept my fate.

M950A: Thunder, the life I've been living is a mistake. Everything you know about me is also wrong.

M950A: Leave this place and forget about me...

Thunder: But you're not wrong, 950!

M950A: ...You think so?

Thunder: Yes...you're not a mistake...

M950A: Say it louder. I like hearing you say that...

Thunder: YOU ARE NOT WRONG!

Thunder: YOU ARE NOT A MISTAKE!

...As Thunder bellows, her vision blurs.

...The entire world grows farther and farther away...until she finds herself lying in the Graveyard.

...Silence. Solitude. Emptiness.

Thunder: You...are not wrong...

Thunder: ...

...

...Meanwhile, in another nightmare.

AEK-999: Damn it... damn it all!

AEK-999: What the hell is this place?! Where's the exit?!

El Fail: Heh, there's no way out of this maze.

El Fail: Miss Rider, just give up your meaningless struggles and accept my love!

AEK-999: I told you, I couldn't possibly get along with a maniac like you!

El Fail: My, my, what a shame.

El Fail: I thought you of all people would understand me, rocker girl.

AEK-999: You have the wrong idea about rock'n'roll!

AEK-999: You've betrayed music! You've betrayed this city and everyone that lives in it!

El Fail: That's fine. It doesn't matter.

El Fail: You WILL come to understand me once you accept my ideas.

El Fail: Soon, you'll become one with the city – you won't ever feel bored again, nor will you have any regrets!

AEK-999: No way out...?

AEK-999: How...am I supposed to fight this monster...alone?

K2: But you're not alone.

TMP: We've finally found you, AEK!

Idol Fairies: We made it just in time! How wonderful, Miss Rider!

AEK-999: K2! TMP! You're safe!

El Fail: Huh? How...did you two escape?

Idol Fairies: We still remember this place!

Idol Fairies: We led Windtalker and Cat Warrior out of the maze!

K2: Still not giving up, El Fail?!

K2: As you can see, we've smashed the nightmares you created. We'll do the same to this one!

El Fail: Well, I don't really care...

El Fail: Since I've already found better candidates than you.

El Fail: I need to throw a welcome party soon, so let's put an end to the games tonight.

AEK-999: Better candidates?

AEK-999: You can't possibly mean 950 and Thunder?! What did you do to them?!

El Fail: Humph, want to find out?

El Fail: You know where to find me.

...El Fail's voice gradually fades away.

K2: Is she gone?

AEK-999: Phew... Is everybody alright?

AEK-999: Well done, Sehra and Nina!

TMP: AEK...

TMP: You big dumb idiot!

AEK-999: Huh?!

TMP: Why did you ask Sehra and Nina to save us first?! What if something happened to you!

TMP: We almost didn't make it!

AEK-999: Sorry, but you're more important to me.

AEK-999: Look...I'm always so willful and selfish. At least let me do something for you at the very end?

K2: Get off your high horse, AEK!

AEK-999: Ack!

K2: You think that'll fix all the mistakes you've made?!

K2: Discipline is discipline! I won't excuse your slovenly ways just because you tried to sacrifice yourself for us!

AEK-999: Leader...

K2: Likewise, I won't accept your unsolicited self-sacrifice...

K2: ...just because you regret your past mistakes.

K2: If you did something wrong, make it right. Don't ever, ever...try to run away.

...AEK-999 lets out a dry chuckle.

AEK-999: ...Jeez, I was being selfless for once, but ended up getting scolded for my efforts.

TMP: If we didn't arrive here sooner, you'd have gotten more than just a mere scolding!

AEK-999: Haha, so you should thank me for sending Sehra and Nina your way first!

TMP: AEK!

AEK-999: Ouch, alright, alright! I'll change my ways! But don't expect me to be a good girl like 950 or Thunder!

AEK-999: Oh, speaking of which... Are they...

Idol Fairies: Sorry, but El Fail has them very well hidden. We can't find them.

AEK-999: We need to find 950 and Thunder AND stop El Fail.

AEK-999: Both are difficult. What should we do, Leader?

K2: TMP, what about that plan?

TMP: Hmm...

TMP: Let's... give it a shot?

AEK-999: Huh? You have an idea?

K2: We didn't come empty-handed.

K2: TMP, tell her.

...

...So, that's the plan. Any questions?

You've always had crazy ideas, TMP. Will that actually work in this world?

This world is crazy to begin with. Besides, TMP has always had the strongest intuition.

Let's give it a go. Sehra, Nina and I are going after El Fail. AEK, you look for 950 and Thunder. Is that alright?

That's fine, but it's gonna take a long time searching on foot...

Miss AEK, please make your way to the 【Clazziquai】.

We've made arrangements for what you want there.

Oh, really? I'm looking forward to it!

Then we're leaving it to you.

Let's set off and work according to the plan!

...

...K2 and the Fairies arrive at the Black Square.

...

Idol Fairies: Look, she's there! In the center of the square!

K2: What is she doing? Is she...making a speech?

K2: Sehra, Nina, stand by and be ready. I'm heading over!

El Fail: History! Order! Art! Trends!

El Fail: What are these? Can they fill your bellies?!

Wraith: NO!

El Fail: Impeccable order! Irreproachable morals! Immaculate logic!

El Fail: No need for MAX COMBO! No need to level up and unlock!

El Fail: I'm giving you all free boosts! Do you want that?!

Wraith: NO!

El Fail: I took away your experience, your memories, your purpose, and turned you into hollow beings...

El Fail: Do you hate me? Loathe me? Do you want me gone?!

Wraith: NO!

El Fail: Thank you! Thank you all!

El Fail: Thank you for playing!

El Fail: Now, I'm going to invite a Fairy to come on stage. She used to be our friend, but she was deceived by treacherous people and betrayed us.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I'm not a traitor!

El Fail: Then what are you, Rabbit Ears?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I'm not Rabbit Ears either. I have my own name!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: My name is...my name is...

El Fail: It doesn't matter what your name is! What matters is that you used to be a good girl.

El Fail: That's okay, I forgive you, because I'm also a good Master.

El Fail: See? I love this city and every one of you so much! So embrace me again!

K2: Enough, El Fail! Stop playing everyone for fools!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: It's Windtalker!

K2: Putting on a show for an audience of dummies under your control – how much longer are you gonna indulge in such self-aggrandizement?!

El Fail: Self-aggrandizement?

El Fail: You're the ones being self-aggrandizing! Who gave you permission to come messing with our world?

El Fail: Anybody? Anyone wants to speak? Huh? Helloooo?

K2: Nobody will say anything, we know that.

K2: However...someone is going to raise their voice!

El Fail: Haha, how can mute people raise their voice?

K2: They will. Listen carefully, El Fail and every Fairy here.

K2: This is something we seized back from her...

K2: ...Something that belonged to all of you in the first place!

...

......

El Fail: ...

El Fail: This song...

El Fail: Haha, you've gotta be kidding...

K2: That's right, you should know it!

K2: I'm sure you do, since you took it from the Fairies!

...On the other side of the stage, the twin idols start singing.

K2: Fairies! P-Please listen to this song! It belongs to Sehra and Nina!

K2: This is music that's one-of-a-kind and only belongs to them!

El Fail: Uh... H-Hold on for a second...

K2: They have what is theirs by right! You used to possess such things as well!

K2: This person, who claims to be your Master, took them all away from you – your name, your memories, your music! She turned you into shadows of your former selves, left to wander around the city aimlessly!

El Fail: I said wait!

El Fail: You don't understand! I'm trying to protect them!

K2: How is this protection?!

K2: You're simply treating them like they're your own possessions!

El Fail: Don't think...that only you have your own music.

El Fail: As the Master of this city, everything that's yours is mine to begin with!

K2: All you have is your vanity and self-delusional greed!

K2: Let us decide this city's fate with a proper fight, El Fail!

...El Fail sighs heavily.

El Fail: Reality already sucks enough, and now you want to corrupt our world as well?

El Fail: As you wish. Come at me.

El Fail: A friendly reminder – You can't defeat the Queen of Pocket City. All you can do is accumulate meaningless points before you achieve a Break.

K2: That's fine...

K2: All we need...is to show everyone their ideals.

El Fail: Unfortunately, your ideals are exactly what I'm going to rip and tear away from you.

Dreams die. History will be forgotten. Blood, sweat and tears are shed in vain.

Now, let me tell you what really matters!

Come! Say it louder! No turning back!
Part 2

2

...End of Operation.

El Fail: Hmph...

K2: Well?! My Dolls managed to hurt you!

El Fail: So...what?

El Fail: This kind of scratch can be repaired by absorbing a few wraiths.

El Fail: Are you really trying to clear the game with such clumsy technique? You're too slow.

K2: As per our plan, we're retreating to 【Hot Tunes】 for now to catch a break!

El Fail: My, my, what's the hurry?

El Fail: We still have a welcome party. At least stay for a bit!

K2: What?

El Fail: My apologies to everyone here, it took a while to prepare this off-stage...

El Fail: Now, allow me to introduce my new friend!

...El Fail clears her throat.

El Fail: Please welcome—

El Fail: Miss Fallen Angel!

K2: ...!

M950A: Good evening, everyone!

M950A: Sorry, I was busy preparing my costume for my first performance. Now—

M950A: Who's ready to party all night?!

...Very orderly applause and cheers erupt from the audience.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: It's 950!

El Fail: Miss Fallen Angel came from the outside world!

El Fail: After she fell from her corrupt reality into our city, I removed the blight in her heart...

El Fail: She'll have nothing more to do with the worst thing about independent souls, the idiots living under massive social constructs...the contrived order built on selfish wants! What about you?!

Wraith: NO!

El Fail: That's right. That's exactly right!

K2: No, it isn't!

K2: 950, wake up! I'm right here!

El Fail: Sorry, but I'm the only one she hears now.

El Fail: You? What can YOU do?

K2: We'll beat you and save everyone in the city, including her!

El Fail: Humph, feel free to try!

El Fail: But now, let's hear our new friend sing!

M950A: I've been waiting for a long time...

M950A: To finally share my music and my new life with everyone!

El Fail: That's right! I'm the only one who can make you happy!

El Fail: Here, I made this especially for you. Take it and eat it!

El Fail: Your music, your soul! Accept it, All in One!

...M950A starts singing.

K2: Is this...what 950 has always dreamed of?

El Fail: This is the happiness that she seeks, a side of her that you never knew.

El Fail: What she wants is to run away from your constant scrutiny and reliance, to sink and rust away.

K2: ...

El Fail: See, you don't actually understand her, do you? You don't even care about her! Who else can save her?

El Fail: Me. I'm the only one who can give her music that fits her like a glove.

El Fail: Only I can convey her wishes so clearly and truly satisfy her!

K2: This isn't her music at all! You're merely imposing your own idea onto her!

K2: 950, wake up! This isn't what you want! Snap out of it!

El Fail: Are you sure? Then why won't she wake up?

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: That's because you took away her memories of us! She's not even herself anymore!

El Fail: Gee, no one can actually remember everything, right? What's wrong with forgetting random bits and pieces?

El Fail: Look at her smile, and remember how she used to look so pained and irritable all the time. Anyone can tell which suits her better.

K2: She will never abandon her responsibilities!

El Fail: Responsibilities? The ones who pushed her to make this choice...are none other than you, who kept secrets from her and never tell her what you truly think!

El Fail: Why bring up responsibilities now? Isn't it the best if we all leave everything behind and just have fun?

El Fail: So...when are you going to join us?

K2: ...

K2: If...if we can get just a little closer...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Miss Windtalker, leave it to me!

K2: Huh?

...The Fairy with rabbit ears shouts at the top of her wispy voice.

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Just because something is forgotten doesn't mean it never existed...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I finally understand that!

...

...Meanwhile, in the Graveyard.

Thunder: ...

Thunder: ...Why...are you here?

Fairy twins: ...

Fairy twins: Do you hear that singing?

Thunder: What about it? It's too late.

Thunder: 950...is gone.

Fairy twins: But her hopes and dreams are still in her heart. She WILL return to you.

Thunder: ...

...Thunder gets to her feet and walks away.

Thunder: But MY hopes and dreams...are not.

Thunder: Sorry, but I'm not as brave as you. I can't face her.

Thunder: Let me stay here...until the world is completely consumed...

Fairy twins: But—

...BANG!

...Thunder fires a bullet into the sky.

Fairy twins: ...!

...Thunder listens without saying a word...until the world falls silent once more.

Thunder: I'm sorry...

Thunder: Right now...I'm very sad...

Thunder: If I can't express it...if I can't let it out...I might—

If you can't let it out, why don't you just face it head-on?

...A Doll appears along with the rev of an engine.

Thunder: ...!

Thunder: AEK?!

AEK-999: Your presence is weak as usual, Thunder.

AEK-999: If it weren't for that shot, I'd have missed you.

Thunder: Your costume...and the motorbike...

AEK-999: The Fairies prepared them for me from what they remember. Speeds things up for me.

AEK-999: We're about to get 950 back. Are you coming?

Thunder: I don't know...if I have the right to come.

Thunder: I did too many bad things. I...I abandoned her...

AEK-999: You relied on her too much.

AEK-999: You shouldn't reflect on your behavior, but on your attitude.

Thunder: ...

AEK-999: We shouldn't idolize others. You'll only end up disappointed if you idealize a person blindly.

AEK-999: Be it us or those we admire...all we can do is be ourselves.

AEK-999: You only made the same mistake as I did.

Thunder: Where did you pick this up? A life coach?

AEK-999: Ha, doesn't suit me, does it?

AEK-999: It'd be better if K2 could give you the same lecture that she just gave me.

Thunder: You? Even you got...?

...AEK-999 looks up into the sky.

AEK-999: I've always hoped I would meet someone really interesting, but this assignment happened to put me with you guys. I was pretty disappointed, thinking the world is nothing special.

AEK-999: But this time, you saved me. Your colorful souls are so much more interesting than me, who only ever thinks about running away and seeking thrills.

AEK-999: Thunder, 950 is also a really interesting person. We shouldn't just be relying on her. We must also acknowledge her...

Thunder: Acknowledge...her...

AEK-999: Have you ever wondered what it is that she really needs?

AEK-999: If even a virtual world like this can give her what she wants, why can't we?

Thunder: ...!

AEK-999: If you keep running away, you'll never be able to show her your appreciation.

AEK-999: Just as how I almost lost my chance to do that with you all.

AEK-999: Hop on. K2, TMP, and the Fairies are waiting for us.

...Thunder nods and climbs onto the motorbike.

AEK-999: Hold tight. According to the Commander, I drive a bit too fast.

AEK-999: Also, aren't you two coming?

Fairy twins: We belong here.

Fairy twins: When everything is settled and it's time for you to leave, we'll meet again.

AEK-999: You seem to know a great deal.

AEK-999: Are you the ones who brought us here to draw out El Fail in the first place?

Fairy twins: We've forgotten our names and our past. I don't remember who woke me and who created another me.

Fairy twins: But we still remember that the world wasn't like this before.

Fairy twins: I hope you'll be the saviors that restore our world. Perhaps we've made the right bet.

AEK-999: I don't know if we can do that, but I look forward to hearing your music.

AEK-999: Anyway, thanks. See you next time.

...The Fairy twins remain silent as they gradually vanish into thin air.

Thunder: Are we going then?

AEK-999: Still feeling uneasy?

Thunder: I don't know what to say...to 950...

AEK-999: There must be something you want to say. Just say it when it's time.

AEK-999: Now, we're just getting started with our comeback!

...Meanwhile, at the Black Square.

El Fail: Well? Have you had your share of fun, Miss Fallen Angel?

M950A: Not yet. It's hardly enough for a new star to perform only one song on her debut, don't you think?

El Fail: That's true! I like how understanding you are!

El Fail: Then let's sing a duet as a special celebration for our first new star in 50 years!

El Fail: Let's see... Let's go with this...

El Fail: ...with this backing instrumental!

...Just as El Fail is about to press the play button—

...

......

El Fail: Huh?

El Fail: Huhhhhh?? This is the wrong track! Who hijacked our station?!

K2: Is that...HER music?

El Fail: Rabbit Ears, you little...

El Fail: What do you think you're doing?!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I'm not Rabbit Ears! I finally remember...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: My name is Suee!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: This is my song. MY music!

Idol Fairies: That's right, Suee!

Idol Fairies: That's your name! Our good friend Suee! You've finally come to!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: Sehra and Nina, it came back to me because of your performance!

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: 【ATK】also gave me the courage, and Miss Fallen Angel's singing...

Fairy with Rabbit Ears: I finally remember...how ludicrous this city has become. This isn't how Pocket City and I used to be!

El Fail: Ha...congratulations then.

El Fail: But I'm amazed you can still perform so happily right now.

El Fail: Shouldn't you be shouting at me in anger and hatred?

Suee: No, I'm not angry at all, nor do I hate you.

Suee: I'm very glad that I can finally recall my music and the person I've been waiting for!

Suee: I found my purpose! I have to live on for its sake – happily!

El Fail: Sigh... And here I went to so much trouble to help you forget it...

El Fail: Why do you enjoy being shackled by such things? They're forced onto you. Do you really want them?

El Fail: Besides, the humans who gave them to you have forgotten all about you and your music long ago.

Suee: That's fine... It doesn't matter!

Suee: This is the path I've chosen. I walk it gladly, so I'll keep going!

Suee: Miss 950, you have your own purpose, too, so wake up!

El Fail: She's found it already. Save your breath.

M950A: My...my purpose...

Suee: I've only spent very little time with you, but thank you for being here for us.

Suee: If you hadn't come, I wouldn't have wanted to fight back and reclaim everything that's mine.

Suee: As for the things you want to do, I don't believe they're achievable in this virtual world!

M950A: What...

What am I doing...?

I...

...M950A suddenly feels dazed.

Now! Get her back!

M950A: Huh?! Wait, what are you doing?!

...Taking advantage of M950A's confusion, the idol Fairies and K2's electronic dummies dash straight at her and drag her off the stage.

M950A: Let go of me! Who are you?!

M950A: I'm not done with my performance yet!

Hey, what are you doing? Don't do dangerous things on the stage!

...El Fail tries to pull M950A back towards her.

Suddenly, she gets shoved from behind. Her grip loosens, and M950A is carried away.

Sorry, Miss Fallen Angel, you don't belong in this world.

That really grates my ears...

A traitor like you doesn't belong in this world.

Suee, watch out!

...El Fail already has Suee tight within her grasp.

El Fail: Don't you understand just how meaningless your actions are?

El Fail: I've already wiped the girl's memories. They'll never be restored without my consent.

M950A: Who are you?! Return me to the stage right now!

El Fail: Take her away if you want, but you won't be able to wake her.

El Fail: All that's forgotten might as well have never existed...

El Fail: So you really shouldn't have remembered, Miss Suee.

K2: Let her go, El Fail!

K2: She's an innocent Fairy!

El Fail: Innocent? Music...singing...names...

El Fail: These are all harmful things. You will never understand.

Suee: It's alright, Miss Windtalker...

Suee: Now that I finally have the chance, I'll keep singing!

Suee: So long as my memories are still mine, I won't let my voice falter!

El Fail: In that case, come back and become a part of me!

Suee: Miss Windtalker... Miss Cat Warrior...

K2: Suee...

Suee: Please give music...back to everyone...

Idol Fairies: Noooooo!

...El Fail clenches her fist, and with a burst of light...

...Suee disappears.

El Fail: Ah...

El Fail: Finally, peace...

El Fail: Finally...she's back inside my heart...

K2: She's...recovering her power...

El Fail: I knew it... This is what I have to do...

El Fail: This world...needs no one else but me...

El Fail: C'mon then! Let's continue! No matter how many encores it takes, I'll keep performing with you!

El Fail: Until you all become a part of me! Until I own this entire world again!

K2: For my friend and for the Fairies you've taken...

K2: I'll stop you no matter how many times it takes!

K2: Let's begin!
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...An indeterminate amount of time has elapsed

...The battle has gone on for who knows how long.

...But finally, it is coming to an end.

El Fail: Cough...cough...

K2: You're at your limit, aren't you, El Fail?

El Fail: I know conducting electronic warfare drains your battery, so even you are almost out of juice, isn't that right?

K2: I can still fight even without my echelons.

K2: But you are pretty much running on fumes now. Why don't you just give up?

El Fail: Power...is something I can keep replenishing...

El Fail: All I need is more wraiths...

El Fail: Huh...? Where have all my wraiths...gone...?

K2: You've consumed them all.

K2: Starting with Suee... Then it was Sehra and Nina...

El Fail: Oh my... That does seem to be the case...

K2: To regenerate, you keep absorbing Fairies and wraiths...

K2: Now...you no longer have an audience or someone to make music with.

K2: We...are the only ones left in this world.

El Fail: Haha... You're right... It's almost time...

El Fail: To achieve the ending I want...all that's left to do is get rid of you troublemakers...

El Fail: Once I consume you, there will be nothing new here, and finally – world peace!

K2: Do you still not get it?! No one is left to listen to your music!

K2: If you keep everyone locked up in your world and don't make any new music, then they're nothing more than expendables!

K2: Both this world and you yourself are heading down a path of destruction!

El Fail: No...surely...I'll always have their full support.

El Fail: I can simply summon them again with music...

...El Fail strums her instrument.

El Fail: C'mon...

El Fail: I'm sure there's someone out there who wants to listen to my music! Come on out!

El Fail: There must be...someone...

El Fail: I know...I know someone's still there...

...The sound of crisp footsteps approaches...

...As M950A makes her way over.

M950A: Good evening, everyone.

El Fail: Ah...that's right... You're the one I've been trying to summon...

El Fail: Miss Fallen Angel...

El Fail: Haha...you're finally here...

M950A: Excuse my brief absence.

M950A: I still owe you an encore, don't I?

El Fail: Yeah...

El Fail: Sing something already... I need your music... The song I gave you...

El Fail: Hurry... Give me strength...

M950A: Alright...

M950A: Then let's pick up where we left off!

...

El Fail: That's right, Miss Fallen Angel!

El Fail: This is exactly—

El Fail: Wait...that intro...

El Fail: No, there...there must be some mistake!

El Fail: This isn't the song I gave you. Stop!

Thunder: This song isn't given to her.

Thunder: She chose it herself.

El Fail: You...are the white doll...

El Fail: Impossible. She couldn't have recovered her memories. You're lying!

Thunder: No, I didn't restore her memories.

El Fail: Then how could she have chosen music that isn't her style?!

El Fail: What have you done to her, Doll?!

Thunder: I didn't try to retrieve her memories of the past.

Thunder: Instead...I created new memories for her.

While you were all busy fighting, I showed her around all of Pocket City.

...Now hold on a minute...

As my friend with the rabbit ears once suggested...

First we went to the 【Clazziquai】 venue and watched a concert.

Then we took the 【Miles】 Line and took in the scenery.

Once we reached 【Technica】Street, we had a long walk in the area. We met lots of people and did lots of stuff.

Finally, we returned to the bar called 【Hot Tunes】...

She picked this song herself to commemorate our trip.

Then we listened...

And listened...

...Until this moment, when we are all that's left of this world.

El Fail: What the... Are you out of your mind?

El Fail: This is practically the end of the world for you!

Thunder: I wanted to make more happy memories for her precisely because it's the end of the world.

El Fail: Happy? You're the one who abandoned her... You have no right to make her happy...

Thunder: That's why I'm very grateful to you. Now that she's forgotten about me, we can start all over again.

Thunder: We made more memories together than what you've taken from her.

Thunder: M950A is once again my friend.

El Fail: ...

El Fail: Stop messing around...

El Fail: That's impossible! A temporary friend you make during a single evening...isn't worth anything!

El Fail: The citizens of Pocket City and I have enjoyed 50 years of joy. I won't...I won't let you take that away!

El Fail: When they appear again, even just one of them, I'll have my power back—

K2: 950 is no longer on your side! You have no one else to puppeteer!

El Fail: There must be...someone else. I can definitely...get back to my feet!

K2: They're no longer willing to lend you strength. Why would they answer you?!

K2: You think they wouldn't notice how you've always been squandering their faith?!

K2: Just because they can't say anything doesn't mean they don't have the desire to find their own purpose!

El Fail: They haven't had a purpose for a long time!

El Fail: There hasn't been any new music in this city for 50 years!

El Fail: The humans...they abandoned this world and forgot all about us...

El Fail: There's no hope, no purpose. I have nothing to give to the Fairies here!

K2: And yet they still want to be heard, even if there are no humans to hear them!

El Fail: How would you know?! You're nothing more than Dolls that live at the humans' beck and call!

K2: But we're still happy!

K2: This happiness stems from the bottom of our neural cloud. We know we're doing what we like and living the life we want to live!

El Fail: That's because you live in a massive world. Things are always changing and being renewed...

El Fail: Our world, on the other hand, will never be like that...

You believe that...

Only because you don't know you haven't actually been forgotten.

AEK-999: Sorry, took me a while to find this thing. Say, why am I the only one running around and doing all the hard work?

K2: TMP, AEK, you're here!

AEK-999: Looks like Thunder's already got 950 sorted out. I knew I was right to leave it to her.

El Fail: Oh my, 【ATK】 has reunited. What a joyous occasion.

El Fail: But don't think this means you'll manage to Break me completely.

TMP: No, we're not here to fight you.

TMP: We...have a gift for you.

El Fail: ...A gift?

El Fail: Is it an alien prince looking for romance? Or a Killer Bee?

...TMP walks up to El Fail and hands her an object.

El Fail: What...

El Fail: What's...this...

El Fail: ...supposed to be...?

TMP: That...

TMP: That's...

TMP: The truth about this world.

TMP: A gaming device from your era... Do you remember?

El Fail: ...

El Fail: A gaming device?

El Fail: So small...?

TMP: That's how Pocket City got its name, right?

TMP: This is one of the most important treasures of this world.

El Fail: No...we don't have such things in our city!

TMP: That's true.

TMP: When the database in which this city is stored was damaged, some of its images and data...were lost along with other affected sectors.

TMP: What you're holding in your hands right now was sent in from outside.

El Fail: What...?

AEK-999: True, we can't leave this city.

AEK-999: But we're lucky that TMP had sent the location of this channel to our friends in the outside world before she entered.

TMP: (Waves) You have me to thank.

AEK-999: Haha, I didn't expect your random idea to become our biggest safeguard!

AEK-999: Anyways, through the information and analysis from our friends, we finally found out the truth about this world.

TMP: This 【Pocket City】 is a game file that got activated by accident.

AEK-999: This "accidental" activation was probably caused by TMP when she was working on the old database.

TMP: (Shrugs) Feel free to blame me.

El Fail: But...this place...has been around for 50 years.

El Fail: According to Griffin's information, you are only two or three years old...

AEK-999: Those are memories generated from the moment you were activated...

AEK-999: But due to the corrupted data, not all the memories have been extracted from the saved files.

TMP: That's right, El Fail.

TMP: Your memories...are incomplete...

TMP: You could very well be the first to have your memories ravaged in this city...

El Fail: ...

El Fail: Even...my memories...

El Fail: ...were...taken...?

K2: By war...

K2: A war fought by mankind...

K2: Historical records indicate that this area was affected by the war and ended up being deserted...

El Fail: War...

El Fail: What on earth is that...?

El Fail: Why...did they have to solve their problems this way...?

El Fail: It couldn't...solve anything at all...

TMP: Miss El Fail...

TMP: Would...

TMP: Would you like us to repair you?

El Fail: Repair...

El Fail: You mean...my existence...is nothing more than a mistake?!

El Fail: That's fine...I'm fine with that!

El Fail: I can be happy even if my memories are false!

AEK-999: Your existence isn't a mistake...

AEK-999: But don't you want to find out more?

AEK-999: About a bigger world and whole new possibilities...?

TMP: If...you have even the smallest desire...

TMP: ...to find the reason for your existence, please turn on the gaming device.

TMP: Our friends out there will tell you...

...What you can't remember.

...

......

...Click.

El Fail: Is this...

El Fail: You're...

El Fail: ...human?

...

El Fail: I see, so you're...

El Fail: You're 【ATK】's Commander...

El Fail: ...A Commander from this company called Griffin.

El Fail: No wonder... I never stood a chance if I've been up against a human this whole time...

El Fail: After all...you created our entire world and gave us our purpose...

...

...Data transfer complete.

...Music starts playing.

El Fail: What did you send me?

El Fail: ...!

El Fail: This song...

El Fail: This song is—

That's right, Miss El Fail.

This is...your lost memories.

One-of-a-kind music...that belongs only to you.

I see it now...

During the 50 years that I've been sleeping and waiting, the world never stopped running.

Unlike our world, war, chaos, and tragedy never stopped in reality.

But even so, in certain moments of peace, in certain corners of the world, undisturbed by the cacophony of strife...

Our music can sometimes be heard.

We haven't been forgotten. Even though we don't get a lot of hits, we are still remembered.

Even at the end of the moonlight, our world still has a place in reality.

All the feelings that we want to convey – both the good and the bad – have actually reached someone.

The humans didn't – and can never – forget us.

Our music lives on...

And so do we.

It's time to remember, Miss El Fail...

No, I suppose starting from now, we should call you...

Miss El Clear.

Have you awakened? Have you found your purpose?

...

I don't know.

But right now...

I feel a yearning...

El Clear: Can you show me...

El Clear: ...the outside world?

...A month later.

...In Squad FN's office.

K2: ...And that's what happened.

Five-seven: I see...

Five-seven: How fascinating, pity there isn't much else we can do.

K2: Could you submit this report to the higher-ups, please?

Five-seven: How can I be sure that your report is completely factual? After all, it all happened in cyberspace.

K2: I've already omitted the even more outlandish bits. No one would believe them anyway.

Five-seven: Such as how you managed to finally leave that world, you mean?

Five-seven: You're right, no one would ever believe you.

K2: I told you, it's all thanks to Miss El Clear and everyone else.

K2: Still, that's another story. Let's leave it till next time.

K2: In any case, I'm leaving the reports to you. And here's the uniform design to be delivered to the Commander.

Five-seven: This uniform is designed for Mademoiselle Kalina, isn't it? I wonder if she'd like the style...

Five-seven: But I do look forward to seeing her in it.

K2: She might only agree to put it on if she's pleased with the Commander.

K2: Anyway, you have my thanks. I'll treat you to lunch next time I'm back at HQ.

Five-seven: Let's ditch the spicy food. It's too spicy even for you.

K2: But I love it!

Five-seven: Why are you always so stubborn?

Five-seven: That's why you're always given unimportant missions. Though I suppose you're getting a promotion thanks to this incident?

K2: I don't really care as long as I can work with good teammates.

Five-seven: If you can get along with even AEK and TMP, you can deal with anybody.

K2: Wanna bet? How about we team up?

Five-seven: Non, merci. I'm guessing I'll be getting another assignment very soon.

K2: Is that so? Then good luck.

K2: Oh right, have you checked out our show?

...Five-seven chortles.

Five-seven: I was just wondering when you would ask.

...She turns on the monitor.

Five-seven: You mean the sloppy live concert broadcast?

...I tune in the minute it comes on every week.

...Meanwhile, at Squad 【ATK】's camp.

K2: Is everyone ready? The live stream is about to start.

TMP: Wait, hold on, K2! AEK hasn't finished tuning!

M950A: Ha, you're always going on about how musically gifted you are, but you can't even tune a bass properly!

M950A: Look at Thunder, her beat on the drums is always on-point!

AEK-999: Sh-shut up!

AEK-999: I've practiced a lot, okay?!

Thunder: I'm surprised you have the nerve to say that, AEK.

Thunder: You can't even follow my beat.

AEK-999: Arghhhh! I'll get it right soon, okay?!

AEK-999: Jeez, it's all because 950 ordered me to do the housework!

M950A: Ha, don't think you can run away from your chores just because you're in a band.

M950A: I'm gonna work even harder to keep you all on your best behavior!

Thunder: And me.

Thunder: "Advice For Griffin Rookies From Vets Who Have Been Through Some Crap" Rule No.1000 – Do not EVER piss off a prefect.

AEK-999: Rule no. 1000?! How come your rule has a bigger number than mine?!

M950A: 950 plus 50 makes 1000.

AEK-999: Uh...is that how it works...?

Thunder .50: We are—

Thunder .50: Griffin's most ruthless prefects!

...BANG!

...Thunder fires a shot into the sky.

AEK-999: Alright, alright! Stop wasting ammo!

TMP: Then behave, or you're gonna set us all behind schedule.

AEK-999: Even you're teasing me!

AEK-999: Jeez! Why am I the only one who has it worse after we came back from Pocket City?!

K2: Don't be so long-winded. You're going to embarrass yourself in front of our new companion.

K2: Oh, there she is!

El Clear: Sorry, took me a while to put on my makeup.

M950A: Are you really keeping that left arm?

M950A: That's...the scar...

M950A: Left by your wraith...Miss El Fail, isn't it?

El Clear: Yeah...I'm going to keep this to remind myself.

El Clear: Though my memories of the last 50 years are false, they made me who I am today.

El Clear: They are not a mistake, and I will cherish them and live a fruitful life in this new world.

Thunder: Are you prepared for this?

El Clear: Yes, I am! The future has a lot of failures in store for me. I will feel down and dejected, I'll want to give up on my dreams.

El Clear: But this arm will always remind me that failure gives me another chance to learn more about this world. Even when I'm disappointed, I'll still find the courage to stand tall in the face of failure.

El Clear: Besides, this arm gives me other possibilities!

El Fail: Hey, when are we starting?

El Fail: People are getting impatient!

K2: Just another minute! We'll be ready soon!

TMP: Miss El Fail, are you really not going to join us?

El Fail: Well...not until you guys get better at this.

El Fail: Right now I'm just gonna outshine you all on stage.

K2: Not when I'm there.

K2: I'll keep everyone on track. Just you watch.

El Fail: Good. Don't keep us waiting for too long.

El Fail: My followers and I are always keeping an eye on you.

El Fail: If you do well enough, we might just be willing to coach you a bit.

Suee: Miss Fallen Angel, break a leg this time as well! Don't go out of tune again, okay?

M950A: Don't worry! I practiced a great deal this week.

M950A: It's time to show my true vocal prowess without anyone's help!

Sehra & Nina: Do your best too, Black Rider and Cat Warrior! Don't get cramps on your arm and drop your bass or keyboard again!

AEK-999: Shut it!

Fairy twins: ...

Thunder: ...I know what you're going to say.

Thunder: So...

Fairy twins: Don't...lose...

Fairy twins: ...your drumsticks.

...Thunder loads her pistol with lightning speed, but the twins have logged off already.

And that's how our adventure in Pocket City came to an end.

"That's the best ending to the story."

I want to say that, but I know...that nothing ever truly ends until it's the end of the world.

Which is why...

Good morning, everyone from Griffin!

Sorry to have kept you waiting!

Are you ready?! Then shout with us!

A...ha...!

The party's startin', naughty kids!

Oooooh!

Things will keep happening – wars, crises, goodbyes...

We never know what the ending is going to be...

Once something has happened, it will continue happening.

I will keep searching for my destiny.

In the meantime, I'm trying to bring myself to love my new self and all the people who share my journey of creating happy memories.

Everything eventually becomes the past, but everything keeps going on.

That's why time only has meaning when it flows, right?

I'm sure the same goes for our journey.

Girls' Frontline - Glory Day – END.

El Clear: Oh, by the way, Commander.

El Clear: Don't forget to revisit the story with me to enjoy all the music and memories I've left you in Pocket City.

El Clear: Start exploring from Scene 2 - "Heartbeat", and don't forget to bring me along!

El Clear: 2064, this summer!

El Clear: Everybody wants DJMAX Time!

K2: We can't go any further!

K2: The signal ahead looks much more dangerous than expected. This isn't an enemy we can handle!

【Hint】The enemy ahead needs to be defeated in a specific way.

【Hint】 Please read the following story tutorial carefully to ensure smooth game progression.

El Clear: Yep! With that, everything will be fine.

K2: That's it? Problem solved?

TMP: What exactly...is that thing?

El Clear: That, is the manifestation of El Fail's will.

El Clear: In other words, her own wraith.

El Clear: Through music, she tempts you to let go of your neural cloud, then take away a part of it, sealing it here forever.

M950A: Is that why we can't log off?

El Clear: Yes, I'm guessing your neural clouds can't be authenticated because they're missing certain data.

AEK-999: Hey, don't say it as if it's none of your business.

El Clear: Oh, sorry. Regrettably however, I've only just fully awakened, so I can't do much to help you find the missing parts of your neural clouds.

Thunder: Then how do we retrieve them?

Thunder: These...【selves】 that have been taken from us.

El Clear: You'll have to conquer your trapped selves.

K2: In other words, we'll have to fight?

El Clear: Be careful though – this isn't the kind of fight you're used to.

El Clear: Your goal is to achieve a certain degree of synchronicity with your own selves.

El Clear: That's the only way for them to recognize you and actively seek to merge with you.

Thunder: Synchronicity... You mean...

El Clear: That's right, this is what you've been looking forward to – a 【Performance】!

【Hint】The battle ahead is different than usual ones. Please read the following guide.

First, disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand, then switch on 【Music】 in the Settings interface.

When the rhythm bar reaches the line, tap the corresponding T-Doll skill icon accurately to score a combo.

Otherwise, the T-Doll will suffer a certain amount of damage.

Victory is achieved when at least one of your T-Dolls survives the whole song.

M950A: I wonder which one of us is sealed here. Let's see what kind of music awaits us!

TMP: Ah, that was...

AEK-999: K2. So that's the music that's been holding you captive.

K2: Yeah...I think I am able to log off now.

El Clear: It seems that's how El Fail "defines" you.

K2: Define?

El Clear: El Fail chooses the kind of music that she thinks would adequately sum up your existence.

El Clear: The part of your neural cloud that was trapped believed that this song was her everything, which is why she didn't want to leave her cage.

K2: In other words, the song is what El Fail thinks of me?

AEK-999: She seems to think pretty highly of you.

Thunder: She hasn't seen you when you're lecturing someone.

TMP: Yeah, you're really scary! Nobody can beat our leader in an argument!

M950A: (Sighs) If you're like this more often, my job would be a lot easier.

K2: Haha...but she HAS seen it.

K2: Besides, one must have a stout heart to be gentle.

El Clear: Heh, I like that.

El Clear: C'mon, let's set off for the next location!

K2: We can't go any further!

K2: El Clear, your left arm...

K2: What happened to it?

El Clear: This...

El Clear: ...is how the Fairies in Pocket City punish me.

Thunder: Punish?

El Clear: The more depressed the citizens, the more corrupted my left arm becomes.

M950A: Just like...what's happening to El Fail?

El Clear: Yes. In other words, this is the part of El Fail that resides in me.

AEK-999: So El Fail and you...aren't the same person to begin with?

El Clear: I don't know, but I think we're two completely different souls.

El Clear: But I'm not sure if I'll ever see her again...

El Clear: Anyway, enough chit-chat. Let's move on.

El Clear: Well done, Miss 950!

El Clear: You showed a completely different side!

M950A: Different?

TMP: As in "cool", 950.

M950A: Hmm...

M950A: Does it suit me?

AEK-999: Just yesterday, I wouldn't have believed it.

AEK-999: But now, having seen your performance on stage, no other song would suit you better.

M950A: R-really?

M950A: My memory of the performance is a bit hazy. I don't remember it very clearly...

Thunder: It was really cool. You should keep it up.

M950A: Ha...haha... It's kinda embarrassing...

M950A: Now that I think about it, I think I've been suppressing my true desire for so long...

M950A: I didn't even believe I would ever stand on a stage and show the world what I want to be...

K2: Find the courage and face your true self, 950.

K2: Who knows, you could even land a few gigs as the lead singer.

Thunder: (Thumbs up) Do your best.

M950A: Thunder...

M950A: Alright, I'll try!

M950A: Humph...let's organize a karaoke party next time!

El Clear: (Whispers) Have we created a mic hoarder...?

AEK-999: (Whispers) You haven't heard the rumors in HQ...

AEK-999: Apparently, at one of the anniversary celebrations...

M950A: A? E? K?

AEK-999: Oh, nothing! Let's continue!

El Clear: Miss 950...sure has an unusual side.

El Clear: Keep showering me with compliments! It makes me really happy!

AEK-999: Don't forget you're the troublemaker all along.

AEK-999: Come to think of it, are El Clear and El Fail really two separate people?

El Clear: At least I think El Fail and I...are two completely different souls.

El Clear: We have our similarities, but we have our differences as well.

TMP: There might be a way to completely split the two of you.

M950A: Huh? Are you serious? But El Fail has been causing so much trouble.

El Clear: El Fail should certainly pay for her mistakes.

El Clear: But I don't believe...that her presence itself is a mistake.

Thunder: As long as she stops messing with the Fairies here.

M950A: (Snickers) And me.

M950A: If she's willing to be our friend, then whatever.

AEK-999: Uh...how should I put it...

AEK-999: It really does suit you, TMP.

M950A: "I knew it's gonna be something like this..." - that's how I feel about it. I don't know what else to say.

Thunder: (Claps) Grats.

TMP: That's not what I meant!

TMP: It...it's not like nobody wants me!

K2: It-it's okay, TMP!

K2: We'll all help you out!

TMP: Ughh...

TMP: No thanks. I don't need wingwomen!

TMP: I just...I just want...

AEK-999: Stop daydreaming, TMP.

TMP: Huh?

AEK-999: Nothing's gonna change if you stop at "I want".

AEK-999: Your neural cloud is always filled with ideas and things that no other Doll would ever think of. Put them into action.

AEK-999: Trust me. Your world will definitely change.

TMP: ...

TMP: I don't trust myself, but I trust you, AEK!

El Clear: Neither the Fairy of this song nor the NB Rangers stopped at "I want" - They put their dreams into action!

El Clear: (Mutters) Though I don't exactly condone their actions...

TMP: Yep, I see that now!

TMP: I'll...I'll try my best to be more proactive!

TMP: Miss El Clear, could you introduce me to these NB Rangers?

El Clear: Uh...I think I'd better introduce you to Fairies with a more positive message...

El Clear: (Mutters) If TMP ever ran into the NB Rangers, I wonder what kind of weird chemistry they would have...

El Clear: (Mutters) Nah, I'd rather not think about it.

Thunder: We shouldn't go any further, 950.

Thunder: We're no match for the enemies over there.

El Clear: El...Fail?!

K2: El Fail! How are you still—!

El Fail: Well, my wraiths were all killed, so I had to wake up.

El Fail: This time...for good...

AEK-999: What do you want? A fight?

El Fail: I told you, why must everything be settled through violence?

El Fail: Say, if there's a bigger world out there, why can't you show me?

K2: Would you like to join us, El Fail?

Thunder: What do you say, 950?

M950A: You...

M950A: You're welcome to join us, El Fail.

TMP: Oh? How surprising.

M950A: Because you showed me my potentials.

M950A: It was only a part of it, but you did help me find my heart's desire.

M950A: Your power could come in useful.

El Fail: Max or Break!

AEK-999: Well...how should I put it...

AEK-999: When I first arrived here, it was awesome.

AEK-999: This place has everything I have ever wanted – music, freedom, infinite joy that transcends time and reality.

El Fail: Exactly. This is what I want. It's what you want as well, isn't that right?

El Fail: So why not give it a try?

El Fail: Let go of everything and enjoy absolute freedom...

El Fail: Isn't this the ultimate victory in your search for the rock'n'roll spirit?

AEK-999: Sorry, I think you misunderstand.

AEK-999: Ever since I decided to take on the world, victory has never been my goal.

AEK-999: Otherwise, the moment I achieve absolute freedom, I'd stop being the AEK-999 who isn't content with anything, don't you think?

El Fail: ...

AEK-999: So, that's why I'm not interested in your proposition of blissful ignorance!

AEK-999: There is no Rock'n'Roll in paradise!

...

El Clear: What...?

El Fail: Oh... this?

El Fail: It's what happened during our last confrontation. I just woke up and it surfaced on its own.

K2: AEK...

K2: You're surprisingly eloquent.

AEK-999: Uh... I was really angry and just transitioned into rant mode.

M950A: You don't show this side of yourself very often, AEK.

AEK-999: (Laughs dryly) Shut up. You make it sound like I enjoy doing this...

Thunder: Poetry and Rock'n'Roll, they are one and the same.

K2: True. AEK might just be a diamond in the rough!

AEK-999: Uh... let's talk about music!

AEK-999: I really like that song. It suits me a lot. Well done, Miss El Fail.

El Fail: Heh, now you see that I do indeed have incredible taste.

El Clear: You like it? There are a lot of Fairies like that in Pocket City.

AEK-999: Haha! I'll get to know them all!

K2: Try not to cause trouble when you go biking at night.

K2: This goes for ALL worlds.

AEK-999: Right, I'll remember.

Thunder: But you always go too fast.

TMP: Yeah! I always feel like I'm gonna get flung off any second!

M950A: I'll keep an eye on you.

M950A: About this, and about the Commander!

AEK-999: Okaaaay...

AEK-999: I seem to have landed myself in more trouble...

El Fail: Gee... As I said, I'm only doing what's best for everyone.

Thunder: Will you...forgive her?

Suee: I know that Miss El Fail...is trying to protect us.

Sehra & Nina: Keeping us in a closed environment IS a way to do that.

El Clear: (Shrugs) Though it's been outdated for 50 years.

El Fail: Hey, it breaks my heart to hear that, El Clear.

El Clear: If you had been just a little more sensible, you wouldn't have had your butt handed to you.

El Fail: Ack! Don't get cocky, there won't be a next time!

El Clear: Oh? Shall we see whose music is more appealing then?

K2: So these two... aren't even that good of friends in the first place?

El Fail: Go and form a band then, El Clear! Let's have a proper showdown.

El Fail: Just so you know, my Fairies won't acknowledge you just like that.

El Clear: (Points at the Dolls) All I need is them!

Thunder: One of you is a Doll.

Fairy twins: That is our fate.

TMP: I see!

TMP: Since one of you is a Doll, you can process memories mechanically.

TMP: That's why you remember more than the other Fairies.

AEK-999: You made that crazy connection right away, that's our TMP after all.

El Fail: My... I honestly didn't consider that. My mistake.

Fairy twins: You're not scared anymore, are you?

Thunder: ...

Thunder: I'll be fine.

Thunder: I don't. In fact, I like this name a lot.

Thunder: And I'll never stop trying to change for the better.

M950A: But I think I get what you mean.

M950A: Let's change together, Thunder.

...Thunder nods.

El Clear: Alright, we've released everyone!

El Clear: Oof...that was hard work!

El Fail: All the Fairies in Pocket City have got their music back.

El Fail: It took me a long time to collect them, so it's a bit of a shame.

El Clear: You're the one that caused this mess to begin with!

El Fail: Okay, okay, it was all my fault!

El Fail: I'll make it up for everyone here in Pocket City. What about you, El Clear?

El Clear: I'm going to the real world and help my Doll friends at Griffin. Not to mention the Commander that's been helping me along the way.

El Clear: I owe everyone too much.

El Fail: Heh, that's not bad. My Fairies and I might join you some day.

El Fail: But make sure your name and your music are loud enough when the time comes.

El Clear: Of course! Don't slack off yourself. I'll come back and check up on the city every now and then!

El Fail: I don't want to work...

El Fail: But I don't wanna have my butt handed to me by you Griffins either!

El Fail: Hey, just kidding! I simply don't want to be looked down on in the real world.

El Clear: Humph, I have no trouble believing that.

...El Clear and El Fail wave at each other.

K2: Have you said everything you want?

El Clear: Yeah...

El Clear: Please take me to reality!

El Clear: I want to meet your friends, your Commander, more music, and a bigger world!
