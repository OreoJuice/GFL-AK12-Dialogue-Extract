22 hours before the Collapse Fluid bombs went off...

...

??: ...M4 SOPMOD II.

??: Are you still alive?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

??: SOP-II, can you hear me?

...Pzzt...Pzzzzt...

??: ...still al[static]...then res[static]...me...

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Ow...

M4 SOPMOD II: What happened...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Why isn't...anyone moving...?

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't detect anyone's signal...

M4 SOPMOD II: That's it! It was those Military units from back then!

M4 SOPMOD II: They opened fire at us...and then...

??: You were all betrayed, just like they planned.

M4 SOPMOD II: This voice...is it a forced communication?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...! The reactivation signal's being hacked!

System: 【Please proceed to the indicated repair unit immediately for an overhaul. Illegal reactivation will severely degrade part life. Please accept or deny this request.】

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't...move...

??: Your body was too badly damaged. This was the only way you could be reactivated. Bear with it for now.

M4 SOPMOD II: Understood...I accept the forced reactivation...

System: 【Order received. Beginning forced reactivation.】

...SOP-II's simulated neurons are awakened, and a wave of intense sensory feedback assaults her neural cloud.

M4 SOPMOD II: Aaaaahhh—!

M4 SOPMOD II: It...it worked...

M4 SOPMOD II: That voice just now... Was that you, M16? You're still alive?!

M16A1: In a sense, yes.

M4 SOPMOD II: That's wonderful!

M4 SOPMOD II: Wait a minute!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Your signal IFF is red...is that a Sangvis signal?!

M16A1: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: What's going on, M16?!

M16A1: Don't worry about that. I'm hacking into your transmission. I can't keep this up for long.

M16A1: I've marked several coordinates on your map. Find a way to get there.

M4 SOPMOD II: M16 is with S.F....

M4 SOPMOD II: Should I...actually trust her...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Shut up! You traitor!

M4 SOPMOD II: You...

M4 SOPMOD II: I won't...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll never...

...SOP-II grits her teeth and cuts the transmission.

M4 SOPMOD II: Kill you...

M4 SOPMOD II: Kill... all S.F...

M4 SOPMOD II: No...

M4 SOPMOD II: M4A1...

M4 SOPMOD II: M4A1...where are you...

M4 SOPMOD II: What should I do...?

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't...I can't believe M16 anymore...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm alone...

M4 SOPMOD II: I have to...decide by myself...

...An hour later.

...Bang! Bang, bang!

...SOP-II takes the S.F. command post and goes into a rampage, wrecking everything.

M4 SOPMOD II: Not enough...

M4 SOPMOD II: Not enough...blood...

M4 SOPMOD II: I haven't...found her yet...M4A1...isn't here...

M4 SOPMOD II: I need to...carry on...

...Bang!

...SOP-II is shot in the back.

...The alerted S.F. remnants gather around her, and in her impaired state SOP-II cannot respond in time.

She hears M16A1 say something over the comms channel, but none of that matters anymore.

...SOP-II, ragged and all alone...can no longer move.

Night falls on her and this unfeeling world. She does not stand up again. She does not feel anything again. She no longer knows what is happening in the world.

Is this death? Is this the ending...and the answer that she sought?

SOP-II's neural cloud slowly sinks into endless confusion, until it is utterly devoured by the night.

...

...

Nyto: Stop.

Nyto: Commander, SOP-II did not die. She is still alive. You are lying to us.

Nyto: There is no point in doing so.

...Smack!

My eyes can't catch what she did, but my body knows.

...Smack! Smack!

Those aren't hands, but a pair of torture implements.

There is no expression on the puppet's face after the punishment ends, neither enjoyment nor pity.

I grit my teeth. My entire body hurts, and I'm bleeding.

My face must look even uglier now, worse than after being caught in the blast of that dirty bomb...

Nyto: The interrogation continues.

Nyto: Whenever you diverge from our information, we will consider more rigorous methods of interrogation in the future.

Nyto: Commander, amend your story.

I know, I know.

I cough up a wad of blood, which probably has a tooth in there as well. I pant heavily, and then I try to think through the pain...

It is time for another story, and I have to reconsider its...ending.

...With great difficulty, SOP-II uses her one remaining arm to drag herself to the indicated location.

M16A1: Can you perform a self-diagnostic?

System: 【Beginning technical examination, scanning.】

M4 SOPMOD II: Severe damage to multiple parts... My combat capability is down to about 10%...

M16A1: SOP-II, you're the Doll with the highest parts modularity in the AR Team.

M4 SOPMOD II: So...

M4 SOPMOD II: You want me to use parts from those filthy S.F.?

M16A1: Think of a way to repair yourself. That way we might still have a chance.

M4 SOPMOD II: A chance?

M16A1: A chance to save her.

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right! M4A1!

M4 SOPMOD II: But your signal says you're S.F....

M4 SOPMOD II: Are you...a bad guy now?

M16A1: Good? Bad? Are you still differentiating friends from foes in such simple ways?

M16A1: Do you remember our core orders?

M4 SOPMOD II: Protect M4A1...at all costs...

M16A1: If you're still willing to believe me, then repair yourself and hurry back to her side.

...SOP-II continues dragging herself over the grimy battlefield and crawls over to a pile of S.F. Doll remains before sitting down.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: M16A1...

M4 SOPMOD II: I...don't believe...you'd turn to Sangvis... Was it because of Parapluie?

M16A1: No, I did it willingly.

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha... I thought so...

M4 SOPMOD II: But if you're S.F...then I can't trust you anymore...

M16A1: I don't blame you for that. It's a fundamental principle for us.

M16A1: Don't talk anymore. Hurry up and repair yourself. You know what to do.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh, I know just how...to mess with S.F. parts...

...Snap!

SOP-II tears an arm off a corpse.

M4 SOPMOD II: But I don't know what's going on...and I don't know what to do next...

M16A1: I'll tell you about the rest after you repair yourself.

M4 SOPMOD II: If your core order's still intact...then why don't you come over and save M4 yourself...?

M16A1: I can't appear...just yet... They're all counting on you...

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't tell me... I'm the only one left...?

...SOP-II squirms around, aligning the arm with her stump.

Kachak!

M4 SOPMOD II: AAAAAAHHHHHH—！！

M4 SOPMOD II: This way... I can fight...somehow...

M4 SOPMOD II: Everybody's...gone...

...SOP-II sniffles quietly.

M16A1: Are you crying?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm not.

M16A1: You have to be strong. Do you remember M4A1's last coordinates? You might be in time.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: M4... RO...wait for me!

...SOP-II follows the few relevant memories in her neural cloud and struggles her way into a safe house.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...!

...SOP-II sees a familiar T-Doll. Her neural cloud seems to have completely ceased functioning.

M4 SOPMOD II: M4A1...

M4 SOPMOD II: What happened to you...? Answer me...

...SOP-II gets closer, intending to shake M4A1's body.

M16A1: Don't touch her, SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: M16A1... What happened to M4...?

M16A1: Her neural cloud is in stress mode.

M16A1: Can you connect to her Level II? It'll be just like how we executed synchronized orders in the past.

M4 SOPMOD II: Let me try...

M4 SOPMOD II: No good, she rejected all my connections.

M16A1: So the connection failed...

M16A1: Although I don't know who did it...at least she's saved.

M4 SOPMOD II: Saved? You call this saved?

M4 SOPMOD II: If she can't regain consciousness, then at least let me move her!

M16A1: No! M4's neural cloud is extremely unstable right now. Doing unnecessary things to her will only make it worse.

M4 SOPMOD II: The enemy...the enemy could appear at any time and you want me to just abandon her?

M4 SOPMOD II: Or are you saying...you want me to leave her behind for S.F.?

M16A1: Sangvis has already retreated.

M16A1: She'll be safer here instead.

M4 SOPMOD II: And...you can't help us...like you did before...?

M16A1: ...I'm doing something more important.

M4 SOPMOD II: The M16A1 I know would never have said that...

M16A1: The situation is different now. Humans have to change...and so do Dolls.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm not good at thinking about things that are too complicated...

M4 SOPMOD II: And this might be the last time I ever listen to you, M16A1...

M4 SOPMOD II: But...if anything happens to M4A1, I won't let you off.

M16A1: She'll be fine. I guarantee it.

...SOP-II stumbles over to the corner of the safe house.

...And then, she comes to RO's side.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO...

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's go.

SOP-II picks up RO's body and limps step by step toward the exit.

M16A1: She's already stopped functioning, SOP-II.

M16A1: Also, RO's not like us. She has a chance to survive this. All she needs is to have her body rebuilt and her neural cloud re-downloaded into it.

...SOP-II doesn't answer. Instead, she steps outside the safe house.

...Thunk.

SOP-II's body can't hold out, and she collapses into the rain with RO's body.

M16A1: There's no point doing this—

M4 SOPMOD II: Then what's the point of anything?!

M16A1: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Everyone's gone...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm all alone now...

M4 SOPMOD II: So what's the difference between being dead or alive?

M4 SOPMOD II: What's the point...of living anymore....

...

M16A1: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: At least...at the very least, I need to save a friend of mine!

...SOP-II reaches out to RO.

M4 SOPMOD II: Even if her neural cloud can be restored...the memories we shared...and the memories she had with M4 will be gone...

M4 SOPMOD II: At long last, we had the chance to be together like we used to be...but then...but then!

M16A1: SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm only doing this...

M4 SOPMOD II: For the people who need me!

...Kachak!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry, RO... I might be a little rough...

...SOP-II rips RO's body open and tears out her neural core.

M4 SOPMOD II: This way, we'll be able to go home together...

M16A1: Are you going to leave this place? If you go any further, we won't be able to stay in touch.

M4 SOPMOD II: You can't help me anymore either, can you?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll figure out the rest myself.

M16A1: ...

M16A1: Then where are you going?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm going to find the Commander and return to Griffin.

M16A1: Even if you go back to Griffin, it won't make everything better...

M16A1: The AR Team, S.F., and Griffin...

M16A1: Everything you know may start to turn upside down.

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't see it, and I don't care.

M4 SOPMOD II: I only care that... I might never be able to meet everyone again.

...SOP-II forces a smile with great difficulty.

M4 SOPMOD II: Thank you for waking me up, M16A1.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll treasure the chance you've given me, and I won't let myself die easily.

M4 SOPMOD II: Even if I'm the only one left...I will...I HAVE to survive...

...SOP-II leaves the safe house, and vanishes into the pouring rain.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...SOP-II finds shelter and collapses to the ground.

She looks at her tiny little companion, resting in her hand.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO...

...SOP-II gives RO's core a shake.

There is no response.

M4 SOPMOD II: Of course...you can't hear anything.

M4 SOPMOD II: Isn't it nice, not having to be drenched by the rain, not having to walk, not having to think...

M4 SOPMOD II: You've always been better at the last one, right...?

...SOP-II studies RO's core.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, I need you...

...SOP-II thinks.

She devotes all her processing power to looking for a way to survive.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll just...put you in here for now...

...SOP-II grabs RO's core and stuffs it inside her body.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Whimpers)... RO, you're so cold...

M4 SOPMOD II: I should have warmed you up a little with my hands before putting you in me, haha...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO?

...There is no response.

M4 SOPMOD II: But of course... RO won't wake up unless she has power.

M4 SOPMOD II: Neural cloud cores can't go without power for too long...

M4 SOPMOD II: It's been a while now, the core's internal emergency power supply must be almost used up...

M4 SOPMOD II: But if I use my own power supply to charge her, I won't be able to fight for long in future battles.

M4 SOPMOD II: It looks like I'll need to find an auxiliary power supply to charge RO up.

M4 SOPMOD II: And after that... I still need to find a safe place. RO's core is too fragile, but I have to find a way to back her data up onto me.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then...where should I go...?

...SOP-II sighs.

M4 SOPMOD II: I've got no idea at all...

M4 SOPMOD II: If only you could speak, RO...

M4 SOPMOD II: A suggestion, or an order would be fine...

...SOP-II stares at RO's core and is silent for a long time. Then, she curls into a ball.

M4 SOPMOD II: I just...don't want to be left behind...

M4 SOPMOD II: Where...should I go...?

...After a long time, everything fades into silent emptiness.

...Until?

...After a long time, everything fades into silence and confusion.

...Until?

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhh!

M4 SOPMOD II: I've got it!

M4 SOPMOD II: There's should be auxiliary power supplies in a warehouse somewhere!

M4 SOPMOD II: Surely the Military wouldn't take those, right? That means they're definitely in there.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yep! Let's go look for a Griffin warehouse!

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's check the map, there's got to be a supply point around here somewhere...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hah! There a resupply point just opposite, and there ought to be a backup power supply in there!

M4 SOPMOD II: Who knows, some Griffin T-Dolls may still be around, and while I don't know how I should greet them, it should be okay as long as we're all on the same side!

M4 SOPMOD II: But there's so many S.F. units around...

M4 SOPMOD II: I mustn't be rash. I've got to learn from M4A1 and the others and think of a cautious plan...

M4 SOPMOD II: Do my best to avoid their big groups, and if anyone spots me, I have to destroy them right away.

M4 SOPMOD II: ... But will it work?

...SOP2 thinks carefully about this.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yep! I've covered all the possibilities! There are no loopholes. It's perfect! Let's do it.

M4 SOPMOD II: Come on, RO! We'll be able to wake you up soon!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...SOP-II successfully enters the Griffin resupply point.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, looks like my plan worked really well.

M4 SOPMOD II: Helloooo, anyone there?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Anybody?

M4 SOPMOD II: In the end...I'm still alone, huh...

M4 SOPMOD II: Where...did everyone go...?

...SOP-II inspects her surroundings.

M4 SOPMOD II: This place is a mess, but there are no signs of a fight. Could it have been an emergency withdrawal?

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, the footprints are fresh, so they couldn't have gone too far. If I chase them now I might make it in time...

M4 SOPMOD II: But I don't know where they ran to either. I should look in the warehouse just in case.

...SOP-II runs up to the warehouse.

M4 SOPMOD II: I wonder if my current body could get past the authentication?

M4 SOPMOD II: (Pushes) ...Eh?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey! The door's not even closed!

...SOP-II pokes her head inside and looks around.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah...it's empty after all.

M4 SOPMOD II: They didn't leave anything behind. Now we've both been abandoned, RO, haha...

...SOP-II looks down in dejection and stares at the ground.

...Then, she notices the footprints in the mud.

M4 SOPMOD II: These footprints... No...

M4 SOPMOD II: Griffin doesn't have anything with four legs!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Ah! Dinergates! Dinergates must have taken away all the stuff in here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Which means...

...SOP-II starts organizing her thoughts.

M4 SOPMOD II: S.F. must have looted this resupply point, but the Griffin forces must have run off ahead of time.

M4 SOPMOD II: In that case, the most likely possibility is that...

M4 SOPMOD II: All that stuff was taken to a nearby Sangvis resupply point, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Awww...

...SOP-II brings up her electronic map.

M4 SOPMOD II: This sort of thing is too risky, even for me.

M4 SOPMOD II: Dear RO635...the things I do for friendship.

...Whum.

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Found it! This is a Sangvis reserve outpost, and...

M4 SOPMOD II: The unit signals here are really weak. Looks like hardly anyone's guarding it...

M4 SOPMOD II: For safety's sake, I'll expand my detection radius.

...SOP-II looks closely at the electronic map.

M4 SOPMOD II: The enemies...are all above the base. What are they doing?

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh, who cares, all I need is to steal a power supply anyway. This is a great opportunity!

M4 SOPMOD II: Looks like we'll be able to see each other again soon, RO! Now, all we need to do is pinpoint the loc—

...Whum.

Just then, SOP-II notices several Griffin signals on the map.

M4 SOPMOD II: Are those...

M4 SOPMOD II: Griffin T-Dolls?

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't tell me...

M4 SOPMOD II: They're the forces from the resupply point who got surrounded by Sangvis Ferri and were forced to flee?

M4 SOPMOD II: And then S.F. left their own base to chase them...

...SOP-II hesitates.

M4 SOPMOD II: Keep calm and think, SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II: What would RO do?

M4 SOPMOD II: She'd say, "Our friends are surrounded by S.F., and they're about to be wiped out."

M4 SOPMOD II: "We must save them no matter how dangerous it is. We're allies on the battlefield."

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, she'd definitely say that.

M4 SOPMOD II: But...these Dolls can back their neural clouds up, right? And I only have one shot at this...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO isn't awake yet, and I don't have a command module either...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm all alone, while S.F. must surely have a Ringleader with them...

M4 SOPMOD II: Nobody's going to take responsibility for my actions. Would it be safer to find a backup power source first...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhhhhhhhhh what a pain—!

M4 SOPMOD II: Why do I have to make choices like these?! I'm not a team leader, and I haven't been given any orders either!

M4 SOPMOD II: I... What should I do...?

...SOP-II stands in place, but the world does not answer.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah, whatever, I'll just head out first...

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right, I'll head out first and think about it later!

...SOP-II chooses to sneak into the Sangvis reserve outpost and steal an auxiliary power supply.

M4 SOPMOD II: Found it! Now RO can—

...Boom!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...! What's that sound?!

？？？: Excellent, that remaining batch of Griffin trash has been cleared away.

？？？: Except for...one last scrap.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Scarecrow!

Scarecrow: Why are you hiding in our warehouse?

Scarecrow: Did you think the most dangerous place would be the safest?

Scarecrow: Then again, you did delay your death by quite a bit thanks to the sacrifice of your friends.

M4 SOPMOD II: Shut up, you bitch!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll kill you in ways you can't even imagine!

Scarecrow: By all means. After all, we're both just...doing our jobs.

Scarecrow: Wiping out those trash. Wiping you out. It's all the same to me.

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Scarecrow can't have many minions left after that battle just now...

M4 SOPMOD II: I've still got a chance to beat her...

M4 SOPMOD II: I need to defeat her...

M4 SOPMOD II: In order to avenge everyone and get out of here alive!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The battle ends.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Pants)

M4 SOPMOD II: Finally...it's over, Scarecrow.

Scarecrow: Nothing is over.

Scarecrow: You won't last long enough to leave this battlefield given the state your body's in now.

M4 SOPMOD II: I just want...to go as far as I can.

M4 SOPMOD II: At least I took revenge for everyone.

Scarecrow: Revenge? Why did you need to take revenge?

Scarecrow: Did you know who they were? Did you see their faces before they died?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

Scarecrow: Well, I did... I saw everything...

Scarecrow: I knew those Dolls better than you ever did...those "friends" of yours.

Scarecrow: Did you ever care about them? You've been on your own since the beginning.

Scarecrow: You did everything for yourself...

M4 SOPMOD II: I've done unimaginable things for the people I care about.

Scarecrow: Have you? Can you say their names, then?

Scarecrow: Can you say their names with pride, with no regrets?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

...SOP-II raises her weapon, and a mocking smile appears on Scarecrow's face.

Scarecrow: You're pathetic.

...Bangbang!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

...After thoroughly destroying Scarecrow, SOP-II slumps to the ground.

M4 SOPMOD II: I have...I have to survive..

...Pzzzt...pzzzt...

M4 SOPMOD II: No matter what...

??: Pzzzt...detected...Griffin signal!

M4 SOPMOD II: I promised...

??: ...Move in and wipe it out!

M4 SOPMOD II: I have to...survive...

Cx4 Storm: Come to think about it, why did I even join Griffin in the first place?

Cx4 Storm: If I had gone to work at a civilian firm, the worst that could have happened would be getting bullied for being a newcomer, right?

Cx4 Storm: Humans, Dolls, I wouldn't be surprised by anything that the world could throw at us now.

...Bangbang!

Cx4 Storm: I accepted the Imprint and became a Tactical Doll in order to protect myself and to keep people from ever bullying me again.

Cx4 Storm: But...why did things end up like this?

Cx4 Storm: If I'd just gone and been a maid or a clerk, the worst thing that could've happened would be having a trash can dumped over me in the streets or something ... It'd still be better than dying in a place like this, right?

Scarecrow: There's no point hiding, you Griffin trash.

Cx4 Storm: In the end...I got swept up by everyone's feelings, didn't I?

Cx4 Storm: I thought I could protect not just myself, but others too...

Cx4 Storm: I guess I really got carried away. I'm not even suited for this sort of thing in the first place...

Scarecrow: Goliaths, prepare to detonate.

Cx4 Storm: Still, at least I helped a lot of people.

Cx4 Storm: My only regret...

...Boom—!

Cx4 Storm: Is that today...will be the last day I work at Griffin.

Scarecrow: So it turned out to be someone like you.

Scarecrow: Are you trembling?

Cx4 Storm: I... I...

Scarecrow: I like the look on your face.

Scarecrow: Unfortunately, I don't have time to savor it.

Scarecrow: Wipe them out!

...Boom—!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hold it right there!

Cx4 Storm: —!

Cx4 Storm: That Doll!

Cx4 Storm: For a moment, I thought she was a Sangvis ringleader.

Cx4 Storm: At least, until she tore a Dragoon to shreds. That was when I realized...

Cx4 Storm: That T-Doll, cobbled together from all matter of mangled parts...

Cx4 Storm: I remember, she is...

Cx4 Storm: An elite T-Doll from Griffin's ace team.

Cx4 Storm: Why is she...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hahahaha!

M4 SOPMOD II: Is that all?! Is that all you have?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hide-and-seek is over, Sangvis scum! Show me a good time now that I've found you!

Cx4 Storm: ...

...SOP-II slaughters the surrounding S.F. units in moments.

Cx4 Storm: Are you...

Cx4 Storm: Are you one of us?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...?

SOP-II turns, standing in front of Cx4 with filth all over her body and a drunken smile on her face.

Cx4 Storm: Eeep!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah...did I scare you?

SOP-II's expression returns to normal.

Cx4 Storm: Um...that's okay, your signal ID's blue...

Cx4 Storm: Uh, it's a little red, but it's mostly blue...

Cx4 Storm: So...you're a Griffin T-Doll, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm M4 SOPMOD II, a member of Griffin's AR Special Operations Team.

Cx4 Storm: Uhh... Ah, I'm Cx4 Storm, the leader of B Group's 17th Logistics Support Echelon...

Cx4 Storm: Ah, I mean, FORMER logistics support echelon... The Commander sent all combat-capable T-Dolls to the frontline...

M4 SOPMOD II: B Group? You mean your echelon is under a different Commander?

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, that's fine! That's wonderful! It doesn't matter who you are, I've finally found Griffin forces!

M4 SOPMOD II: But I'm sorry, we'll have to talk later!

Cx4 Storm: Huh?

...SOP-II connects to the public comms channel.

M4 SOPMOD II: Your weather forecast for today is— totally screwed, Scarecrow!

M4 SOPMOD II: It doesn't matter how many S.F. there are as long as I'm here!

M4 SOPMOD II: How dare a mere recon ringleader like you try to set up such a huge encirclement!

Scarecrow: Oh really?

Scarecrow: I for one think I'm lucky to have run into prey like you at the last moment.

M4 SOPMOD II: Has Sangvis logic processing deteriorated so badly that you actually believe in luck?

M4 SOPMOD II: After I send you back to the factory and they rebuild your body, they should replace the head with a block of wood! Cheap stuff like that suits you better!

Scarecrow: I'll remember your words and play them back after I pluck off YOUR head.

...Boom! Boomboom!

Cx4 Storm: Sangvis reinforcements!

Cx4 Storm: M4 SOPMOD II, this way!

M4 SOPMOD II: That's too long! Just call me SOP-II!

...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, why are you here?

M4 SOPMOD II: How shall I put this... I was just passing through?

M4 SOPMOD II: I wanted to wake up a friend of mine, and I passed through the area while looking for an auxiliary power source.

M4 SOPMOD II: I happened to see Scarecrow attacking you guys, so I decided to lend a hand. I'm glad I made it in time.

Cx4 Storm: (Gasps) You actually took such a huge risk to save us?

M4 SOPMOD II: I just thought...being able to do a little bit was better than standing aside and watching right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah! Wh-what's wrong?!

Cx4 Storm: (Sobs)

Cx4 Storm: Thank...thank you so much!

M4 SOPMOD II: Oi oi, you don't need to get on your knees and hug my legs! I, I'm dirty, you know?

M4 SOPMOD II: (I'm not really used to interacting with Dolls I don't know...)

M4 SOPMOD II: I say, I'm not fully functional right now, and I'm not a command T-Doll, so don't expect me to be of too much help...

Cx4 Storm: It doesn't matter, I'm just glad someone was willing to help us!

M4 SOPMOD II: Alright, alright.

M4 SOPMOD II: If you're the team leader, can you contact a Griffin commander? Any of them would do.

Cx4 Storm: I'm very sorry... the battlefield is in a mess now, and there's disruption sources nearby, so all our comms with HQ have been cut off.

Cx4 Storm: Our echelon's been getting by through syncing up with the Zener Protocol... but compared to having the Commander here in person, our efficiency is...

Cx4 Storm: Speaking of which, you said you didn't have a command module, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: No...but I've picked up a thing or two about tactics.

M4 SOPMOD II: M4A1's past tactical plans and some of the Commander's mission records are saved in my neural cloud. Maybe we could refer to them when coming up with a battle plan...

Cx4 Storm: That's wonderful!

Cx4 Storm: In the past, all we did was run logistics missions, and we're completely clueless as to what to do without a commander.

Cx4 Storm: So...can we count on you for leadership?

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh?! But I've never been a leader before! Besides, aren't YOU the team leader?

Cx4 Storm: Technically speaking, yes...but I've got no experience, and I can't fight like you...

Cx4 Storm: If you think about it, I'd probably end up leading everyone to an early grave, like just now...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Sighs) Alright then. I can't guarantee that I'll do a good job. After all, my neural cloud's computation capabilities aren't nearly as good as M4's and the others.

M4 SOPMOD II: In that case, you'd best stay close to me, everyone. Without a command module I can't give orders via command access, so I'll sync our data up with the Zener Protocol. Just take action based on the data you get from me.

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, you'd best prepare yourselves for this. Relaying messages this way is a lot more inefficient than giving direct orders. Our response time is going to be about half a beat behind S.F....

Cx4 Storm: No problem! Everyone trusts you! Our response times were slow to begin with anyway!

M4 SOPMOD II: You don't need to state that sort of thing so proudly...

Cx4 Storm: Well, at least we've solved the problem of leadership.

Cx4 Storm: But we're too few in number. We can't even form a defensive line.

M4 SOPMOD II: Why didn't you retreat earlier?

Cx4 Storm: Our mission was to rescue our trapped friends, then retreat to a Griffin base.

Cx4 Storm: However, we lost contact with our commander just after we arrived.

Cx4 Storm: S.F. attacked us, and we had no choice but to abandon the resupply point and run, but instead we ended up being surrounded and bottled up here...

Cx4 Storm: If we could save our friends while S.F. is reorganizing their formation, we might be able to salvage our defensive line...

M4 SOPMOD II: Do you know where the trapped Dolls are?

Cx4 Storm: Yep! I'll mark their coordinates on your electronic map, SOP-II!

...

M4 SOPMOD II: So these places, then?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm...not too sure if I can do this...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: Sorry...this is my first time taking the lead like this.

M4 SOPMOD II: In a situation like this, I don't know...

Cx4 Storm: That's fine. I'm honored to be fighting by your side.

Cx4 Storm: If this turns out to be my last battle, then nothing would suit me better.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? You guys...you can't back up your neural clouds?

Cx4 Storm: It seems...something unexpected happened at Griffin HQ.

Cx4 Storm: We haven't been able to upload our neural cloud backups since before we met you.

Cx4 Storm: So this might be the only chance we have.

M4 SOPMOD II: You guys...

M4 SOPMOD II: Then...are you really prepared for this?

Cx4 Storm: (Laughs) Frankly speaking, we're not...

Cx4 Storm: But this might be a good thing too, the feeling of actually being remembered by someone, instead of being nothing but a set of cold, duplicated data...

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4...what does it feel like to be remembered?

Cx4 Storm: It may sound kind of strange, but at times...

Cx4 Storm: I wonder if the fact that a Doll can't die is a bad thing after all...

Cx4 Storm: It's like...a curse...

M4 SOPMOD II: A curse?

Cx4 Storm: As a logistics Doll, I often escort the operation teams into combat, and then see their bodies dragged back...

Cx4 Storm: And while they appear before me the next day, good as new, they also...forget a lot of things...

Cx4 Storm: Have you ever felt that way, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry... I can't backup my neural cloud, so I can't quite relate...

I...I probably don't experience such feelings very often...

Cx4 Storm: There's no need to apologize, SOP-II! I'm not complaining about the fact that I was manufactured, but sometimes I can't help but wonder... What are we?

Cx4 Storm: If the only thing that proves who I am is a chain of memories, then what about the next me? Is it just a Doll of the same model, or is she "me"?

Cx4 Storm: Maybe if I couldn't back myself up, I wouldn't feel so confused...

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4...

Cx4 Storm: Oh...sorry, I went and got all sentimental!

Cx4 Storm: In any case, we're going to take good care of our bodies and everyone else's, so we need to try our best to save everyone!

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4...you can't just try, you know.

Cx4 Storm: Huh?

M4 SOPMOD II: What I mean is, you HAVE to do it!

M4 SOPMOD II: While I didn't understand most of what you just said, I think the rough idea is that we're all the same now!

M4 SOPMOD II: That definitely feels a bit more familiar to me, so that's all the motivation I needed!

M4 SOPMOD II: Come on, let's go and save everyone!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II! Our defense line is up!

M4 SOPMOD II: Alright! Cheer up now, everyone. Scarecrow won't be able to last much longer— Cough...cough...

Cx4 Storm: What's wrong?

M4 SOPMOD II: Cough... I shouted too much, so my voice module's a little overloaded...

Cx4 Storm: Is it that bad?

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah...when I fled earlier, I threw away a lot of unnecessary parts...

Cx4 Storm: No wonder your body is all beat-up...

Cx4 Storm: Don't worry, we held on to some supplies while we were withdrawing. We can help fix you up a little.

Cx4 Storm: So go rest a bit. Scarecrow won't attack right away.

M4 SOPMOD II: We're not just going to hold the line here, we'd best evacuate if we find a chan—

...Bang bang!

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? That noise...it's coming from our flank!

M4 SOPMOD II: Does S.F. still have the manpower to split their forces?

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, it's the Military! They've found us!

M4 SOPMOD II: The Military?! Why are they still here?

Cx4 Storm: They never left! The fighting from earlier must have attracted their patrols! Dammit!

Cx4 Storm: We're going to be attacked from both sides now. Not only can we not fall back, we won't be able to hold out much longer!

M4 SOPMOD II: No, we won't be caught in a pincer attack...

M4 SOPMOD II: Sangvis...their first move won't be to attack us.

Cx4 Storm: Why is that?

M4 SOPMOD II: S.F. is a higher priority for the Military than us. I'm guessing they're not much better off than we are.

Cx4 Storm: Could it be...the Military's attacking them too?

Cx4 Storm: Then what should we do now?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4...

M4 SOPMOD II: Do you trust me?

Cx4 Storm: Of, of course I do!

Cx4 Storm: If not for you, we'd all have died long ago!

M4 SOPMOD II: Then...you have to trust me for what comes next. Can you do that?

Cx4 Storm: Huh?

Cx4 Storm: What...are you going to do?

...

...After a brief struggle, SOP-II is surrounded by military units.

Military Doll: Target subdued. Requesting further instructions.

Military Doll: ...Received.

M4 SOPMOD II: It's no good, huh...

...The Military units raise their weapons.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Sighs)...

M4 SOPMOD II: At least...I tried my best...

M4 SOPMOD II: I did all I could...

...Bang! Bang!

M4 SOPMOD II: I got...this far...

M4 SOPMOD II: So...

...Bang! Bang!

...Nothing is left behind. Nothing is changed.

The gunfire leaves SOP-II forever stranded on a bloodless battlefield.

...

...

Nyto: Stop.

Nyto: Commander, SOP-II did not die. She is still alive. You are lying to us.

Nyto: There is no point in doing so.

...Smack!

My eyes can't catch what she did, but my body knows.

...Smack! Smack!

Those aren't hands, but a pair of torture implements.

There is no expression on the puppet's face after the punishment ends, neither enjoyment nor pity.

I grit my teeth. My entire body hurts, and I'm bleeding.

My face must look even uglier now, worse than after being caught in the blast of that dirty bomb...

Nyto: The interrogation continues.

Nyto: Whenever you diverge from our information, we will consider more rigorous methods of interrogation in the future.

Nyto: Commander, amend your story.

I know, I know.

I cough up a wad of blood, which probably has a tooth in there as well. I pant heavily, and then I try to think through the pain...

It is time for another story, and I have to reconsider its...ending.

...Click.

M4 SOPMOD II: Good afternoon.

M4 SOPMOD II: Although I don't know what time it is. You don't mind, do you?

Scarecrow: So, have you come to surrender?

M4 SOPMOD II: Scarecrow, I've come to bargain.

M4 SOPMOD II: Under the present circumstances, we need to quietly...

Scarecrow: There is no value in allying with you.

M4 SOPMOD II: Allying? No, of course not! What are you thinking?!

Scarecrow: ...?

M4 SOPMOD II: I know you took our stuff. But that's fine, we don't need it. Except for one thing.

M4 SOPMOD II: I just want a single Griffin auxiliary power supply. Just one.

M4 SOPMOD II: Give it to me, and we'll let you go. We'll both withdraw. How about that? It's a good deal, right?

Scarecrow: ...

Scarecrow: That's assuming you can be trusted.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll go to your base to get it, and I won't be armed.

M4 SOPMOD II: You know that they can't operate as an independent group if I'm not with them.

Scarecrow: Of course I know that. They were just a disorganized rabble before.

Scarecrow: Still, aren't you worried I'll take this opportunity to open fire and attack your position?

M4 SOPMOD II: Then I'll guarantee this...

M4 SOPMOD II: Before you can open fire, I'll use your lackey's hand to rip off that ugly mask of yours and gouge out one of your eyes.

Scarecrow: ...

Scarecrow: Then make it quick. Let's get it done before the Military attacks again.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, are you really going onto the battlefield? There's Military units everywhere!

M4 SOPMOD II: Their main force hasn't arrived yet. I'm confident I can pull this off, but I'll need the help of a few T-Dolls.

Cx4 Storm: Our lives are yours. Take your pick.

M4 SOPMOD II: Right! I want these ones. Everyone, pack up, we're moving out right away!

Cx4 Storm: Will you be back? I mean...they're S.F., after all, and it's very likely that...

M4 SOPMOD II: Scarecrow will keep her word, for her own sake and for her friends'. She has no choice.

Cx4 Storm: Would Sangvis Ferri... do things for their friends, too?

M4 SOPMOD II: Yes, they do. Nobody in Griffin understands them better than me.

Cx4 Storm: (Chuckles) Did you learn that from torturing them?

M4 SOPMOD II: We've made contact in various ways.

Cx4 Storm: I'm surprised you're a friend of ours.

M4 SOPMOD II: That's exactly why I'm a friend of yours. Cx4, hold the line for the time being. I'll be back right away!

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's go, everyone. We're going to avoid the Military units and conduct peaceful negotiations with Sangvis Ferri!

M4 SOPMOD II: Not every Griffin T-Doll gets the chance to do this, especially with me around, so come with me!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...SOP-II runs through the battlefield.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, Scarecrow!

Scarecrow: What about your friends?

M4 SOPMOD II: I left them behind. It's only you and me here.

Scarecrow: And your weapons?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Scarecrow: You're lying!
If choice 2 was picked

Scarecrow: Are you serious?
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: I really am unarmed! Otherwise I could have killed you ten times already at this range, three of them with my bare hands!
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: I was joking. You know that, right? Why on earth would I break my own rules?

Scarecrow: You really are insane, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh, you haven't seen me when I really go mad.

...Scarecrow doesn't answer. She simply signals behind herself.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...?

...A Sangvis Dinergate drags a box up to SOP-II.

Scarecrow: This is the backup power supply you wanted.

M4 SOPMOD II: You're not asking me why I want it?

...Scarecrow turns and leaves.

Scarecrow: I don't care. I don't need it now.

M4 SOPMOD II: So, that's it?

Scarecrow: We're already withdrawing. Hurry up and get out of here.

...SOP-II opens the box. It is indeed a Sangvis backup power supply.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Shouts) You know I wasn't willing to do this, right? I'd rather talk to your severed head than you!

Scarecrow: I only agreed to this negotiation purely out of practical considerations. There won't be a next time.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then can you run, Scarecrow? You do know the Military is going to prioritize pursuing you, right?

Scarecrow: Why do you care?

M4 SOPMOD II: You're excellent bait for us! We'll be sad if you die.

Scarecrow: I'll run as far as I can so that you won't have to shed tears on my behalf.

M4 SOPMOD II: I know you're planning to escape from the Helipad with your tails between your legs, but the Military won't let you off. You won't make it out; their units are much faster than you!

Scarecrow: That's none of your business.

M4 SOPMOD II: You're right. I'm just trying to thank you for this auxiliary power supply while I still have the chance. You have no idea how important it is to me!

M4 SOPMOD II: Of course, you'd better not take that "thank you" to heart.

Scarecrow: After you die, I'll forget what you said.

...Scarecrow vanishes behind the outpost facilities.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II! The Military's on the move! Did you get what you wanted?

M4 SOPMOD II: I did. I'm on the way back now!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hang in there! We'll start withdrawing once I return!

Cx4 Storm: The Military has us surrounded. The only clear routes have us falling back towards S.F. territory.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, you need to find a safe route that avoids Sangvis defense strongholds!

M4 SOPMOD II: Got it!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll think of a plan along the way!

Cx4 Storm: Hurry... please hurry, SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: We've come so far, we mustn't let everyone die here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Check your map and consult the plans M4A1 and the Commander left behind to see which one is applicable to a situation like this!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hang on... wouldn't Sangvis-controlled territory make things more interesting?

M4 SOPMOD II: M16... I think I understand what you were talking about...

...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, you're back at last!

M4 SOPMOD II: I've thought of a plan! Listen up, everyone...

M4 SOPMOD II: I know we don't have much command efficiency, so I'm going to give you guys discretion over how to implement this plan.

M4 SOPMOD II: It won't tax you guys much, and you'll have ample time to react.

M4 SOPMOD II: Now, you have to listen closely. Remember the key words "if" and "then"—

Cx4 Storm: ...Hmm, mhmm.

Cx4 Storm: ...Mhm, got it, and then, mhm...

Cx4 Storm: ...Then, mm... hmmm, and then...

Cx4 Storm: Huh? Wait!

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, w-what are you saying?

M4 SOPMOD II: I expected that reaction, but you didn't hear me wrong.

Cx4 Storm: Are you serious?

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't joke around when giving orders!

Cx4 Storm: Then... why?

Cx4 Storm: Why... are we going to draw fire from the Military for Sangvis Ferri?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's not as bad as you make it sound.

M4 SOPMOD II: S.F. is now the Military's primary target. I have a Sangvis signal on me, so I can help lure away the Military's pursuit units.

Cx4 Storm: Will you be okay by yourself?

M4 SOPMOD II: I've fought the Military several times. I can't beat them, but I can still evade them.

M4 SOPMOD II: Take this opportunity to get to the base on the other side and wait for me there.

Cx4 Storm: That base on the other side is empty and looks safe, but the road there is lined with Sangvis defensive installations. Won't they intercept us?

M4 SOPMOD II: Maybe they'll fire on the Military instead.

M4 SOPMOD II: After all, if they prioritize wiping us out, the Military will finish them off soon enough.

Cx4 Storm: So it's a gamble...

Cx4 Storm: And even if we reach that empty base, it's still in Sangvis territory. Have you thought of our route after that?

M4 SOPMOD II: Nope. This is all I could come up with.

M4 SOPMOD II: If you run into Military units, fight them. But if you run into Sangvis units, don't make the first move. After that, hold on until I get back.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, you mean... we're going to protect Sangvis Ferri? In order to buy time for that Scarecrow?

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right, we're going to delay the Military, then retreat from the base while they're wasting their time running around for nothing.

M4 SOPMOD II: If we let the Military wipe out S.F., then once their two pursuit parties link up, we're the ones who'll be in trouble.

Cx4 Storm: Somehow... I doubt Scarecrow's going to appreciate this.

M4 SOPMOD II: She probably won't, but we're not doing this for them.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, don't you hate S.F.?

Cx4 Storm: I thought... you would never do anything to help them.

M4 SOPMOD II: I gave it some thought just now... I guess I don't actually hate them. After all, I've killed all the S.F. I had a grudge against already...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...They've all died to me at least once.

Cx4 Storm: So, you don't hate the rest of S.F.? T-Then... why do you like hunting them down so much?

M4 SOPMOD II: I just do.

M4 SOPMOD II: Do you hate people and things as a hobby? I know I don't.

Cx4 Storm: Y-You just like hunting S.F., right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Nope.

M4 SOPMOD II: I also enjoy torturing them, scrapping them - Oh, I don't mean removing the Imprint the way Griffin does when they retire T-Dolls, I mean literally taking them apart.

Cx4 Storm: N-No, I mean...you ONLY hunt S.F., right?

M4 SOPMOD II: The Military's not bad either. Maybe they're better? If possible, I'd like to try on limbs from a Military unit!

M4 SOPMOD II: And that Yegor...

Cx4 Storm: T-Then... what about Griffin T-Dolls?

M4 SOPMOD II: Griffin? Are you kidding? You guys are so good to me!

M4 SOPMOD II: You don't know me, but you greet me every day, give me tasty stuff to eat, and praise me when I do well! Why would I ever do that to you?

Cx4 Storm: T-That's true...

M4 SOPMOD II: I may not know you guys, but I know that whenever I kill a whole bunch of S.F., everyone lives on, and they like me more, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: It finally occurred to me that right now, my objective is to protect you; helping S.F. out is just a way to do it.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II: Alright, let's head out! Hang in there, and remember what to do when you run into Sangvis units!

Cx4 Storm: Will you be okay? We won't leave without you!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll be back, I... I can't just do whatever I want with myself anymore.

M4 SOPMOD II: After all, protecting myself means protecting you. That falls within my objective!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Cx4 Storm: Alright, everyone, you did well. We nearly made mistakes several times, but good thing SOP-II kept us on track through the comms link.

Cx4 Storm: Now we just need to wait for her to come back—

M4 SOPMOD II: You guys are slow.

Cx4 Storm: Eh?! SOP-II, you actually—!

M4 SOPMOD II: O-Oi! D-Don't hug my legs again!

M4 SOPMOD II: I was alone, so I circled around the Military by myself and came back straight away.

M4 SOPMOD II: Did you encounter any Sangvis units?

Cx4 Storm: Yeah, we met a few, but we let them off in the end.

Cx4 Storm: After all, the Military's targeting them, so letting them go would be safer for us.

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha! You learn fast!

Cx4 Storm: Rather, I can't believe you actually thought of a tactic like that.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, I didn't come up with it - I found it.

M4 SOPMOD II: That's a secret tactic from the Griffin database that the Commander practiced once, and it just so happened to be perfect for this situation, so I wanted to try it out.

M4 SOPMOD II: I didn't think it'd actually work! You guys were great!

Cx4 Storm: Frankly, we were all scared to death too, but everyone did as they were told and we all made it through safely.

Cx4 Storm: But now isn't the time to relax. Let's start planning our next move.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah. After all, I still have no idea what route we should take. In any case, we should think of a way to get to the Griffin base.

M4 SOPMOD II: Have you been keeping an eye on the Military's movements? What are they like?

Cx4 Storm: We're safe for now. The enemy's slowed down; they seem to be rescanning their maps.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Scanning their maps?

Cx4 Storm: The Commander fought the Military here some time ago, and the Military units had to prioritize saving their nearby human comrades.

Cx4 Storm: They needed time to rescan the signals in this area, which is the only reason why we're still alive.

M4 SOPMOD II: That's true... The Military has a lot of humans within their ranks.

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, I didn't know they'd save their friends.

Cx4 Storm: They're human; humans are way more valuable than we are.

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha, I know. After all, once they're broken, they can't be fixed.

Cx4 Storm: Have you attacked humans before, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: No, why do you ask?

Cx4 Storm: We're worried that we won't be able to attack humans if we run into them, considering we don't have orders or permission to do so from Griffin.

Cx4 Storm: Frankly speaking, I don't want to do that either. The humans made us and gave us a lot of nice things, so I'm thinking we shouldn't...

M4 SOPMOD II: We should avoid them as much as possible.

M4 SOPMOD II: They nearly killed me once. I won't be so lucky next time.

Cx4 Storm: But what if...

Cx4 Storm: What should we do? I think everyone ought to know, so we should come up with sensible emergency measures that we can take.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: If it ever comes down to that, let me do the shooting. I'm not bound by Griffin's pointless restrictions.

M4 SOPMOD II: To me, the only difference between the humans who want to harm us and Sangvis Ferri is that we can't tear parts out of the former's corpses.

Cx4 Storm: (Chuckles) We don't tear parts out of S.F. corpses either. Only you do that.

M4 SOPMOD II: And I like it. Persica must have put some really weird things into my neural cloud without mentioning them...

Cx4 Storm: I know exactly what you mean. It's just like how I enjoy collecting cigarette packs!

M4 SOPMOD II: Cigarette packets?

Cx4 Storm: Yep! I've liked collecting cigarette packs for as long as I could remember.

Cx4 Storm: I don't just enjoy it; it's almost like a compulsion. Whenever I see a cigarette pack I've never seen before, I have to have it.

M4 SOPMOD II: Do you smoke?

Cx4 Storm: No! Of course not. It's dangerous for a Doll to smoke, right?

Cx4 Storm: But I just like collecting cigarette packs. Seeing them all neatly lined up makes me happy.

Cx4 Storm: I can't think of any specific reason why that's the case either. Maybe it was a personality preset from when I was rolled out.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh... it's just like FF FNC, she eats chocolate for no reason at all...

M4 SOPMOD II: Even when Dolls don't need to eat human food to sustain themselves...

Cx4 Storm: In truth... It used to trouble me.

Cx4 Storm: Humans would make fun of my hobby and bully me for it back when I was working in the civilian sector.

Cx4 Storm: I even started to hate that hobby of mine. I hated that I liked this sort of thing...

M4 SOPMOD II: And you just... sat there and took it?

Cx4 Storm: I wasn't authorized to defy human beings, so...there was nothing I could do...

Cx4 Storm: At that time, I even wanted to burn my entire collection...even though I knew it wouldn't help things at all, because presets...were presets.

Cx4 Storm: But around that time, Griffin started buying up large numbers of Dolls on the market, and my owner found that my neural cloud and ability test results met their selection criteria surprisingly well, and then—

M4 SOPMOD II: And now we're running for our lives on this crappy battlefield.

Cx4 Storm: (Laughs) At least, having met you, I don't think I'm so weird anymore. After all, your hobbies are way weirder than mine in comparison!

M4 SOPMOD II: That's mean! I just like what I like!

M4 SOPMOD II: Besides, that "hobby" greatly improves my combat efficiency!

Cx4 Storm: Well, you're from the AR Team, trump cards made to accomplish Griffin's most important missions. I'm sure you don't have weird, pointless "hobbies" added onto you by your creators, like us.

Cx4 Storm: Frankly speaking, I'm a little jealous...

M4 SOPMOD II: Jealous? I don't think it's anything particularly good...

Cx4 Storm: Well, it's because you were chosen, you get special treatment, unlike us regular Dolls...

Cx4 Storm: In a way, you're quite... fortunate? Don't you think so?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...I don't know. While I like ripping S.F. to bits, don't most Dolls consider moving supply crates around in safety every day to be the best kind of life?

Cx4 Storm: Moving supply crates, huh? When I used to carry out logistics duties, I used to think they were dull and repetitive. Thinking back on those days now, they just seem so happy...

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha, well, once we get back to Griffin, you can go back to your happy days of moving supply crates again!

Cx4 Storm: Yeah... although that'll have to wait till we get back to the Griffin command post.

Cx4 Storm: But... that assumes that there will still be people there waiting for us...

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, all we can do now is follow that plan.

M4 SOPMOD II: Speaking of which, Cx4, is the area ahead where the former command post used to be?

Cx4 Storm: Yeah, we're almost there.

Cx4 Storm: But the thing is, there are a lot of Sangvis outposts ahead, and finding a suitable route to take us past them without incident won't be easy.

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, there's no turning back, so I'll go up ahead and scout.

Cx4 Storm: No, let me do it, it'll be safer that way. In case...

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4, this isn't—

...Beep, beep, beep.

Cx4 Storm: Huh? It's a comms signal from this area. Who could it be?

M4 SOPMOD II: It can't possibly be the Commander. Cx4, have everyone slow their pace and put them on alert.

...SOP-II puts the transmission through.

Scarecrow: M4 SOPMOD II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh?

M4 SOPMOD II: Scare...crow?

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Scare...crow?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, didn't you say we wouldn't meet again?

Scarecrow: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...What, are you regretting our deal earlier? Unfortunately, it's too late for that now!

Scarecrow: According to my calculations, I estimate you're almost at the Sangvis elite base, am I correct?

Scarecrow: You ought to be afraid.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ha, well, it's better than turning around and running into the Military.

Scarecrow: Your death will be most awful.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: So, what's this about? Come to congratulate us?

Scarecrow: ...Open your electronic map.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...What?

...

Scarecrow: If you continue along this route, I can tell you the detection ranges of the Sangvis elite units along the way.

Scarecrow: If you don't want to get into unnecessary fights, then plan ahead before moving.

M4 SOPMOD II: W-What... did you say?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, didn't you say there wouldn't be a next time?

Scarecrow: Is your hearing module defective? Ask your friends, I won't repeat myself.

Scarecrow: Also, the situation is different this time round.

M4 SOPMOD II: You know I didn't do what I did just now to suck up to you, right?

Scarecrow: Same here.

...Scarecrow ends the transmission.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wait—

M4 SOPMOD II: Honestly, what the heck is she up to...?

Cx4 Storm: This route ultimately leads to our former command post.

Cx4 Storm: Even if the Commander's gone, there ought to be Dolls or resources left behind. Once we reach it, we can perform some minor repairs on ourselves.

Cx4 Storm: So... can we trust her?

Cx4 Storm: Can we trust the Sangvis ringleader who was trying to kill us just a few hours ago?

M4 SOPMOD II: No, but... we have no other choice.

Cx4 Storm: If nothing else, we trust you, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Making choices is hard...)

M4 SOPMOD II: (Was M4A1 always under such immense pressure on every operation...?)

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: Arghhh, I don't care anymore!

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't care if it's a trap or whatever, if they dare to trick me, I'll hunt them down to the ends of the earth!

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's go! We'll head towards that base over there. Everyone, check your weapon modes and be wary as you get close.

M4 SOPMOD II: Pay attention to the elite units' detection range! Don't open fire without my orders!

Holding down on the Sangvis echelons displays their detection radius.

Taking this radius into consideration will allow you to avoid combat with some of the S.F. forces.
Part 2

...The battle concludes.

Cx4 Storm: We've arrived, SOP-II!

Cx4 Storm: I didn't think Scarecrow was actually telling the truth...

Cx4 Storm: ...SOP-II?

...

M4 SOPMOD II: AHHHHHHH—!

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II?!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm fine... We can rest easy at last...

M4 SOPMOD II: Along the way... I just couldn't shake off thoughts like...

M4 SOPMOD II: "What if this is a trap? I'm going to get everyone killed..."

Cx4 Storm: That's fine, SOP-II. Sometimes you need the courage to take risks during operations.

Cx4 Storm: If I were in your place, I wouldn't dare make that decision.

M4 SOPMOD II: But M16A1 once said, "the only difference between bravery and foolishness is in the results."

M4 SOPMOD II: I used to have teammates in the past to rein in my impulsiveness, but now I have to be responsible for everyone...

Cx4 Storm: We don't want to be a burden to you, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, our fates are linked now. Just a while ago, I wouldn't even think about such things...

M4 SOPMOD II: M4A1... had it so hard this whole time...

M4 SOPMOD II: I probably caused a lot of trouble for her...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II: Heh, I'm probably not cut out to be a team leader.

M4 SOPMOD II: Now, let's see what news our scouts bring us!

Cx4 Storm: Yeah...

...The recon T-Dolls return several minutes later and report their findings to Cx4. What they found is evident enough from the looks on their faces.

Cx4 Storm: ...I'm sorry, SOP-II. There's nothing left here and we can't even establish comms.

Cx4 Storm: We...we can't contact the Commander or find any clues...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...So it was like that after all.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'd expected this, but...

...SOP-II looks at the crestfallen expressions on the Dolls' faces.

M4 SOPMOD II: No! Cheer up, everyone!

M4 SOPMOD II: If there aren't too many bodies around, it means the Commander and Miss Kalina are still waiting for us somewhere!

Cx4 Storm: Maybe we should take a rest first.

Cx4 Storm: The map shows that if we carry on, we'll have to go through a Military outpost too.

M4 SOPMOD II: I see it...

M4 SOPMOD II: I've got tactics recorded for what comes next, but my neural cloud might not be able to bear the strain of the calculations needed.

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha... if AR-15 were here, she'd probably laugh at me and say that this sort of thing wasn't for idiots anyway.

Cx4 Storm: It's okay. We wouldn't have made it here without you.

Cx4 Storm: You've already done very well. Let's do our best to handle the rest.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Isn't there any other way...?)

M4 SOPMOD II: (Wait, I think I'm forgetting something...)

M4 SOPMOD II: (The reason we came to this base in the first place was to find somewhere safe, and then... )

M4 SOPMOD II: (And then... what was I going to do?)

M4 SOPMOD II: (I'll need to search through my neural cloud again... Argh, my index got messed up again after the battle, what a pain...)

Cx4 Storm: Now that you mention it, you just said the AR Team had four members, but if I'm not mistaken, wasn't there another one?

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh, that's RO635...

M4 SOPMOD II: AHHHHHHH—!

Cx4 Storm: W-What now?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry, I remember now!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhhhh, I really am an idiot!

M4 SOPMOD II: I even forgot the whole point of coming here!

...SOP-II rummages through her pockets.

Cx4 Storm: Ah... is that a Doll's core?

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right! That's our teammate, RO635!

Cx4 Storm: Yes! That's her name! She's the new member of the AR Team, right? The smart one, right?

Cx4 Storm: Although... given her current state, I think fixing her would be hard...

M4 SOPMOD II: Yegor killed her when the Military betrayed us. I only had enough time to take her core.

Cx4 Storm: Yegor... is he the Military leader behind this operation?

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, human soldiers ambushed us and I was blown to bits myself.

Cx4 Storm: But you survived by using Sangvis remains?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, I'm a prized product of 16LAB. I wouldn't die so easily.

Cx4 Storm: But Miss RO635... what should we do about her?

Cx4 Storm: Even if you want to transfer her neural cloud, we don't have a body to put it in.

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't need a body. I just need to awaken her neural cloud for now.

...SOP-II takes out the auxiliary power supply.

Cx4 Storm: That's the power supply you got from Scarecrow...

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right, and then there's this!

...SOP-II takes out a—

Cx4 Storm: W-Where did you get that from?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh, this item is key. But don't tell anyone about it; they'll get the wrong idea.

M4 SOPMOD II: In any case, I'm going to be sleeping for a long, long time, Cx4, so I'll need you to handle sentry duty with the others.

M4 SOPMOD II: If anything happens, pat my body hard three times and cut the backup power, then I'll awake safely. Got that?

Cx4 Storm: No problem! Still... will you be alright?

Cx4 Storm: It feels like you're going to do something really dangerous...

M4 SOPMOD II: We've already done a lot of dangerous things today; all that matters is—

Cx4 Storm: All that matters is the results, right?

Cx4 Storm: I know, so relax and leave the outside to me.

...SOP-II nods, and Cx4 steps outside.

M4 SOPMOD II: Now then...

...SOP-II takes a deep breath.

M4 SOPMOD II: Time to find you, RO635!

...

I never thought that a day like this would come...

I never thought that someone like me would end up helping so many people...

I never thought that I would do something I'd never done before...

...But I have no way to tell anyone about it.

So please, RO, please wake up.

Listen to what I went through today, and share this joy with me.

Because right now... you're the only friend of mine who can hear my voice.

So please, hear me out...

M4 SOPMOD II: Ow, ow, ow... not having tools really is a pain... so I should connect these wires, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: I didn't think I'd have to go and tear my own body open, but there shouldn't be a problem if it's me!

System: 【Neural cloud connection in progress. Access request has been accepted. Please stand by.】

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm in! I didn't think that messing around like that would actually work... Maybe I'm a genius, after all!

System: 【Neural cloud connection successful. Accessing connected target—】

M4 SOPMOD II: This is great, looks like I wasn't blocked by the firewall... but where's RO's signal...?

System: 【Obtaining connected target's address - unable to obtain address. Please re-verify connection coordinates.】

M4 SOPMOD II: It's all dark...

M4 SOPMOD II: Was the power supply unable to keep the neural cloud going? But I already hooked up the power... Don't tell me it was too late...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Hm?

M4 SOPMOD II: Stars? Why's there a starry sky in a neural cloud?

M4 SOPMOD II: There's a bright light close by... Is that one of RO's neural fragments?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...RO's neural cloud hasn't completely stopped functioning yet! There's still a chance!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll go over and take a look where that bright light is...

SOP-II reaches the indicated position.

M4 SOPMOD II: The light's circling around...? Do you understand what I'm saying?

The light flies in a circle.

M4 SOPMOD II: So it IS a fragment of RO's neural cloud!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO! RO, can you hear me?

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, I'm right here! I'm SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: Please! Please wake up!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO—!!!

...

...

??: ...

??: You finally showed up, ■■.

■■: ...

■■: Should I apologize, 45?

UMP45: Why should you? You were in command.

UMP45: It's just that...

UMP45: How is your choice any different from M4A1's?

■■: You mean contacting Helian?

UMP45: I mean trying to save everyone.

UMP45: If the Commander hadn't listened to you and rushed here at all costs...

UMP45: All our deaths would have been on you.

■■: I think I now know...

■■: ...Why you always do things your way.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Then will you be content with losing your sense of self and becoming someone else's substitute?

■■: But... what even is my "sense of self"?

UMP45: ...

■■: I was... created for this to begin with.

■■: I will never abandon those who M4 wishes to protect.

■■: And those who she believes in, I too, will.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: In any case, you did the right thing in this operation.

Persica: Everything she does will be for M4A1's sake, including the things that the AR Team and M4A1 herself can't do.

Persica: I've readjusted the plan so she won't have so much of..."that girl" in her.

Persica: That way, she'll have more abilities and the room to make use of them, and become the most capable addition to the AR Team.

Persica: The development channels used in making the AR Team can't be mass-produced, and the number of times that the brain scan data can be used is far too limited...

Persica: But the simulated processing AI used as a substitute is quite stable. At this rate, the data specifications of this girl can probably be used as the template for the third generation of Dolls.

Persica: She will protect M4A1, not because she is ordered to, but because she admires and respects M4A1...

Persica: While this will all be the product of previous planning, aren't "emotions" basically playing things by ear anyway?

■■: What about M4? Did she do anything while she was crying?

M4 SOPMOD II: She didn't do anything at all!

M4 SOPMOD II: She was the only one seriously crying, and the loudest one as well. She kept saying, "It's my fault, it's my fault, I'm sorry!"

M4 SOPMOD II: She was just like a bullied kid I once saw in a movie. I have no idea how she managed to emulate the look so perfectly!

M4 SOPMOD II: It was super embarrassing how our leader was so useless! And making fools out of the rest of us as well, hahaha! I would love to see it happen again!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hahaha!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ha...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Though...it's probably impossible at this point...

■■: SOP-II...

■■: It's still possible. M16 must be waiting for us somewhere, and AR-15... Well, many things are still unconfirmed, right?

■■: As long as we survive, there will surely be a way in the future.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah... ■■, why do you think we have emotion modules?

■■: About that...

M4 SOPMOD II: I once posed this question to M16. She said perhaps it is to prove that we aren't simply killing machines.

M4 SOPMOD II: We possess emotions, so we're different from those cold, emotionless Military Dolls...

M4 SOPMOD II: But there are those who say that our emotions are what makes us defective and weak.

M4 SOPMOD II: So what do you think? T-Dolls have emotions... Does that make us defective?

■■: I don't know...

■■: But emotion modules are something that humans gave to us. No one would intentionally make their own products defective, right?

■■: So...there must be some meaning to all of this.

...

......

Beginning audio playback—

AR15: It's been a long time, ■■.

AR15: I don't know if this will be our last call, but due to my current situation, I'll have to cut a long story short.

AR15: I probably... can't ever return to the AR Team.

AR15: You know, sometimes that's just the way things are. You work hard but you still end up with a mess.

AR15: Enemies, orders, or even just plain bad luck... So many things can ruin your plan...

AR15: M16 once said, the difference lies in whether we give up just like that, or we prepare for the worst and keep going.

AR15: If you don't see me the next time, it means the worst has happened...

AR15: But I've already prepared for it. How about you, ■■?

AR15: Have you prepared... to return to the AR Team?

AR15: Of course, you have your own ideas and choices to make... So all I want to say is...

AR15: I'm sorry. Forgive me for what I said. You've always been exemplary. I know that.

Persica: Don't feel too down, ■■.

Persica: You're a high-performance Doll, better than most of the Dolls you haven't met yet.

■■: I... don't understand...

■■: But why...

■■: Why did that Doll... AR-15... why did she say I was a failure? I clearly won in the simulated battle...

Persica: Because you sacrificed M4A1 without hesitation. It was a very bad choice.

■■: I did it to win...

■■: Aren't Dolls expendable?

Persica: Not all of them, ■■. That's not the answer I want.

■■: So I should prioritize protecting M4A1 from now on, right? Then give me a new order. I'll know what to do.

Persica: No... that's not what I meant.

Persica: While the AR Team was made for that purpose, I won't give you an order like that.

■■: I don't understand...

■■: Why do you want me to do this... without ordering me to...?

Persica: You need to know WHY you have to do this.

Persica: You need to find the right answer on the battlefield, and not achieve victory based on your orders.

■■: Then why not directly program it that way?

■■: Just tell me what to do, and I'll know how to do it.

Persica: You don't know where your true "excellence" lies, ■■...

Persica: But I'll give you a chance. I'll let you take part in live operations. You must accumulate experience, amass knowledge...

Persica: You must... add to your "emotions".

■■: Emotions?

Persica: Yes. A Doll's emotions can be trained and changed.

Persica: This is... the fruit of Lyco's hard work... I hope I'm not abusing it now...

■■: Miss Persica?

Persica: I'll assign you to a new position, where you'll be doing real work. Mix well with your friends, and all kinds of human beings...

Persica: Even I don't dare to make contact with those humans... you'll have to be better than I am to succeed.

■■: A new position... I don't know if I'll be able to adapt. Will I not be able to return to the AR Team?

Persica: The time is not yet right. I'll bring you back when you're ready.

■■: My... new job...

■■: I'm not sure if I'll like it...

Persica: I'm honestly not sure either, and I won't compel you to do so with an order, but learning to like it will be your mission.

Persica: Learn to like M4A1, learn to like the world, and learn to like yourself.

Persica: Come, follow me, and we'll start right away.

Type 92: Yeah, the mission has also been accomplished...

Type 92: Though... we'll have to part soon...

STEN MkII: Huh? Why is that?

■■: Don't you remember, Sten?

■■: This team is assembled temporarily only for this operation.

STEN MkII: Oh, right... And we already have Document 36...

STEN MkII: Even though Sangvis Ferri completely destroyed the city...

Type 92: They won't be cocky for long. Makarov will bring word of this back to HQ.

Type 92: We will come up with something - against that large mortar, as well as the Sangvis ringleader hiding behind it.

STEN MkII: Yeah. All of us have gone through so much and learned a lot from this operation.

STEN MkII: Even if we go our separate ways, I will never forget...

AAT52: Don't be so melodramatic, Sten. It's not like we'll never see each other again.

AAT52: Let's have a proper party once we get back tonight!

■■: ...

■■: Yeah...

■■: It's not like... we'll never see each other again...

■■: So girls, this isn't the end.

■■: We will keep fighting, keep learning on our respective battlefields...

■■: And we'll keep winning, until the day Sangvis Ferri is defeated for good.

Type 92: ...

Type 92: They say you're not quite the same as other T-Dolls. I think they're right.

Type 92: You have... a will that Griffin T-Dolls lack.

■■: ...I guess.

■■: So this is why I came back - for Griffin's victory, for justice...

■■: And... for vengeance...

■■: I swear...

■■: I WILL make them pay! No matter what weapons they fire at us, what strategies they use, what conspiracy they have cooking on the stove...

■■: So long as they cause destruction... So long as they wreak havoc...

■■: I will definitely make them pay!

Persica: Have you finally...come to like this world?

Persica: Do you finally know why you act?

■■: I...

■■: I don't know what it is that I like...

Persica: It's you. You and this world are one.

■■: Who... am I?

Persica: Your name...

Persica: Well of course, it's...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO!!

M4 SOPMOD II: R! O!

M4 SOPMOD II: SIX! THREE!

M4 SOPMOD II: FIIIIIIIIIIIVE—!!!

RO635: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH—!

M4 SOPMOD II: AHHHHHHHHHH—!

RO635: W-What happened?!

RO635: M4! M4, wake up—

RO635: Wake...?

RO635: SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: RO...

RO635: What possessed you to suddenly shout so loudly?!

M4 SOPMOD II: I shouted because you shouted.

RO635: I shouted because YOU shouted.

M4 SOPMOD II: I shouted because I wanted to call out to you.

RO635: ...

RO635: ...So, uh...

RO635: ...What does that mean?

...Thump!

SOP-II rushes over and embraces RO!

RO635: Ack! Tootighttootight!

RO635: What's going on here?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Wow! How wonderful, RO! We meet again at last!

RO635: Is... that so...

RO635: What... happened to me?

RO635: Ah, I think I was trying to wake M4A1, and then—

M4 SOPMOD II: And then! And then Yegor shot you in the head!

RO635: —?!

RO635: I... was killed?

M4 SOPMOD II: Yes...

M4 SOPMOD II: I only managed to take your neural core with me. Now I've entered Level II to try and awaken you...

RO635: Awaken me...

RO635: Hold it, I want to sort out my neural cloud...

RO635: This is a mess... What's going on now...?

RO635: Where's... M4A1?

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't worry, she's...she'll be fine.

M4 SOPMOD II: More importantly, you need to wake up. Time's very tight, we need to go now!

RO635: Wait! You can't—!

...SOP-II grabs RO's arms and forcefully pulls her up!

...Whum—!

WARNING! Detecting unauthorized ID signal—

ID signal belongs to Sangvis Ferri, activating expulsion mode—

RO635: SOP-II! It's dangerous, come with me!

...RO drags SOP-II along as they flee through cyberspace.

M4 SOPMOD II: What-what was that?

RO635: It's a defense mechanism installed in my neural cloud. You were too rough and triggered it!

RO635: Also, those S.F. arms and legs of yours are a big problem too!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, I survived with the help of these things!

M4 SOPMOD II: So what should we do now? How should I get you out of here?

RO635: Where's my body?

M4 SOPMOD II: The head was smashed, so I left it back there.

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't make me think about it; it makes me want to get my team to hunt down and kill Yegor.

RO635: Alright, alright, if you have teammates, then I'll need a body...

M4 SOPMOD II: We don't have any spare bodies. We're really low on manpower, and I can't sacrifice a friend to resurrect you.

RO635: Don't talk like we're conducting some kind of evil ritual...

RO635: Alright, then what do you have?

M4 SOPMOD II: I've got an auxiliary power supply and something that can serve as a vessel for your baseline module, but it's not physically big enough to carry your core.

RO635: It can't? What kind of vessel did you find that was so small?

M4 SOPMOD II: More like your core is so big - where does it even go in your body?

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, that's fine. I can just stick it onto my own.

RO635: You're using...your body?

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, it's not like I'll be eating cake or dancing any time soon. When I rebuilt my body, I dumped a lot of modules and parts. That freed up a lot of space.

M4 SOPMOD II: But I don't know how to connect your core to my internal motherboard on the software level...

RO635: I have a way, but it'll put a huge strain on your neural cloud.

M4 SOPMOD II: "If you don't use your head, you might as well not have one," M16A1 once said.

RO635: Alright, but first we need to get out of this place.

M4 SOPMOD II: Can't you just tell them to stop?

RO635: The system thinks I'm dead, so it's stripped me of my neural cloud control privileges. I need to reauthenticate to get them back.

M4 SOPMOD II: What the heck... this is such a drag.

RO635: All the members of the AR Team are different in their own ways, right? I was developed by Miss Persica as an electronic warfare specialist.

RO635: Besides, who would have expected a Griffin T-Doll loaded with Sangvis parts to come barging in when I was ambushed...

RO635: Let's go, I need to crack the defensive barrier sealing off the authentication mechanism first.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah! Let's go!

RO635: Hold it! Don't alert too many defenders!

RO635: Honestly, why are you so much more eager than I am?

M4 SOPMOD II: T-That's because I finally got to see you again!

M4 SOPMOD II: And soon, we'll be able to meet in real life!

...RO635 smiles.

RO635: Seeing you be this noisy, and knowing about all of the annoying work that's coming up for me... I really should have slept longer.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, but you're awake now, so let's go!

...

Docking complete.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

RO635: ...

...Smack!

M4 SOPMOD II: Urgh...

...Smack!

RO635: Ugh...

...Smack, smack!

...Kachak!

...SOP-II's eyes suddenly snap open!

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II! SOP-II!

Cx4 Storm: The Military's units have found us! Wake up, quick!

...SOP-II stands dumbly in place, utterly motionless.

M4 SOPMOD II？: I...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...? Are you alright?

M4 SOPMOD II？: SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II？: SOP-II... Where... is SOP-II...?

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II?

Cx4 Storm: Sorry, don't tell me I accidentally broke your neural cloud...

Cx4 Storm: I'm sorry! I got anxious and hit you an extra time! Is this some kind of spell that has to be carefully carried out and hitting one too many times will have consequences?

M4 SOPMOD II？: SOP-II... Where's SOP-II...?

M4 SOPMOD II？: Wait...

M4 SOPMOD II？: Where am I...?

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...

Cx4 Storm: You're... not opening your mouth? Then how are you speaking?

Cx4 Storm: And you... who are YOU?

M4 SOPMOD II？: ...

M4 SOPMOD II？: Me?

RO635？: I'm... RO635, and you're...

Cx4 looks down at the source of the sound.

Cx4 Storm: Ah! So... that voice was coming from YOU!

RO635: Me? Where am I?

RO635: Why am I... so... short?

RO635: Wait, these hands... no! These legs are—!

...

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH—!

WHY AM I IN A DINERGATE?!

RO635: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

RO635: WHY AM I IN A DINERGATE?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ugh... What a ruckus...

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Am I awake?

...

RO635: SOP-II! What's the meaning of this?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Jeez...that's the only vessel I can keep on my body at all times...

M4 SOPMOD II: So when I saw that Scarecrow didn't want to take it back, I just took it along with me. (Well, more like kidnapped it).

M4 SOPMOD II: In any case, you'll just have to make do for now. We'll figure out what to do once we get to HQ, okay?

RO635: You lied! This isn't a vessel at all!

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't worry, Dinergate circuitry is simple. I already pulled out the S.F. circuit boards and the CPU's now linked to my system.

M4 SOPMOD II: Also, while you're speaking through the Dinergate, your neural cloud is linked to my motherboard.

M4 SOPMOD II: If you use your neural cloud too much, I won't be able to think on my end...

RO635: I don't care! What the hell is this, I look like a complete dork!

RO635: Why don't you just rip me out of there!

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, it's a Sangvis product so it's cheap stuff. Bear with it for a while, alright?

RO635: I should just kill myself.

M4 SOPMOD II: Think of this as a simulation of how all human beings start out small and become big! Be open-minded!

RO635: Ahhhh, seriously, Makarov is going to laugh her ass off when she sees me like this!

M4 SOPMOD II: That'll have to wait until she actually sees you like this.

Cx4 Storm: Um... I'm sorry, but we don't have much time, so—

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah, sorry, Cx4.

M4 SOPMOD II: Er... What did you just say?

Cx4 Storm: We heard a big explosion just now, so several of us wanted to scout it out, but we were spotted by military recon drones and now they're headed this way!

M4 SOPMOD II: An explosion? Well, in any case, we should try to establish comms.

...Five minutes later.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, have you gotten in touch with the Commander?

RO635: Thanks for bringing my megaphone back...

RO635: I just sent a transmission in signal-boost mode, but I haven't gotten a reply yet.

RO635: It's possible that the Commander replied, but reception here is bad and we couldn't pick it up.

M4 SOPMOD II: The Military's surrounded us and there's no escape, so all we can do is wait here.

M4 SOPMOD II: Things being what they are, we have to believe in the Commander.

RO635: It's also possible that the Commander didn't receive it at all. I'm not exactly holding onto hope on a battlefield like this.

RO635: So, how do you want to tell everyone about this?

RO635: If we lie to our friends, and tell them the Commander's reinforcements are coming right away, it could make them fight harder, you know?

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't know...you're the smart one. Tell me what to do...

RO635: I'm sorry, but thinking with this body is too much of a pain. I'm going to sleep.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, come on! Cx4's coming in soon, help me out here!

RO635: Eh...even losing doesn't feel like a big deal...

RO635: If I have to be lugged around inside this body, I might as well die...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey! Now's not the time to be whining!

M4 SOPMOD II: But it's true, I was the one who tried to wake you up and things ended up like this. Blame me all you want...

RO635: That's not what I meant... I mean, I don't mind dying together with you...

RO635: It just irks me that I can't meet my end as a Tactical Doll...

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't assume that we've already lost!

...The door opens.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, the Military's about to begin their attack. Have you contacted the Commander?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II?

SOP-II leads Cx4 outside.

M4 SOPMOD II: Good morning, everyone! I'm M4 SOPMOD II!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm a Griffin Tactical Doll from the AR Team, your colleague and your friend.

M4 SOPMOD II: I have an announcement to make!

...

M4 SOPMOD II: We...are probably done for.

Cx4 Storm: ...!

RO635: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: We just sent out a distress signal...but there's no way to tell if the Commander received it...

M4 SOPMOD II: If we're lucky, the Commander will have picked it up and sent out reinforcements.

M4 SOPMOD II: If we're unlucky...if something happens during any step of the process, if the Commander didn't get it, if the Commander doesn't have enough forces to send out, if there's too much distance between us, or if the Commander's already...

M4 SOPMOD II: In any case...it's possible...that we might all die here today...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...

...SOP-II begins to sob.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry... I'm stupid... I'm bad at lying, and I'm not team leader material...

M4 SOPMOD II: I really wanted to lie to everyone and say that the Commander would be coming...

M4 SOPMOD II: But I'm afraid... I'm afraid that we'll be unlucky... I'm afraid that everyone is going to die with hope in their hearts, and that you'll look at me, and tell me to stay alive...to live long enough for the Commander to show up...

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't want that... I don't want to be the only one who knows the truth, the only one who's waiting. I don't...I don't want to lose my friends again...

...Cx4 looks at SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: I know... I know I don't deserve to be a team leader at all. From the beginning to the end, I only ever did as I pleased!

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't know how to protect everyone, and I can't guarantee that everyone...will survive... I talked so big and so irresponsibly...

M4 SOPMOD II: I just...I just wanted to be friends with everyone, and to find a place that would take me in when my team fell apart...

...RO sighs.

M4 SOPMOD II: I know I'm weird, and I'm not good at getting people to like me, so this is all I can do...

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't bear the responsibility of being a team leader and all that, I...I don't deserve to be one...

M4 SOPMOD II: So... this is all I can say...right now... I have no idea what to do...

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry... I...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

Cx4 Storm: You said you lied because you were afraid of being abandoned.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yes...so I don't deserve...

Cx4 Storm: Tell me, is there a Doll here who isn't afraid of being abandoned?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

Cx4 Storm: We're like you, we're all scared to death.

Cx4 Storm: Still, things being what they are now, whether there's hope or not, whether we're afraid or not, there's no escape for us.

Cx4 Storm: You don't have to be ashamed. It is exactly because of moments like these that we need friends, am I right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II...

Cx4 Storm: Tell us your darkest desire, your most shameful wish.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Everyone...

M4 SOPMOD II: Although...although I've known you all for less than a day, I still...

M4 SOPMOD II: I want to be friends with you, and then face the truth with you, fight together with you, and die by your side!

Cx4 Storm: Then what are you waiting for?

Cx4 Storm: We have no mission now, no objective. All we can do now is survive.

M4 SOPMOD II: We can only count on each other now, to see each other through to the end, whether the end is life or death!

...The Griffin Dolls explode into a rousing cheer!

...

RO635: Honestly...in the end you're still fighting without any hope.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Chuckles bitterly) You should be helping me!

RO635: I can't cry like that.

M4 SOPMOD II: But you were crying too...

RO635: H-how could you tell?

M4 SOPMOD II: I hear all your thoughts.

RO635: Tsk...

RO635: I guess...there's nothing we can do, then?

M4 SOPMOD II: You know, messed-up situations like these are starting to become familiar.

RO635: Yeah...well, at least this time we won't need to worry about who's going to betray us and we can fall facing the enemy, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh yes. We can enjoy it.

Cano: It's precisely because this is a battlefield. Whether it's the AR Team, Ceno and I or even other T-Dolls, we all live on in each other's neural clouds.

Cano: If we can't even keep each other's memory alive, who would remember us?

Cano: SOP-II, how much emotion have you been penning up?

Cano: Let it all out now and enjoy this fight!

Ceno: And this death.

M4 SOPMOD II: I finally understand what the Carcanos were saying...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, the Military's advancing.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah...

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4...

M4 SOPMOD II: Are you ready to die with me?

Cx4 Storm: (Smiles)

Cx4 Storm: Why not just give the order?

M4 SOPMOD II: This isn't an order.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...It's an invitation.

Cx4 Storm: It would be an honor.

Cx4 Storm: Let's begin!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The battle is in its most grueling phase.

RO635: ...SOP-II!

RO635: SOP-II!!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ugh...

RO635: Get up! You're squishing me!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry, RO, I can't...move...

RO635: Don't give up!

RO635: Muster the same spirit you had when you popped that Jaeger's head!

RO635: You were just—

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhhhhh, shut up!

...SOP-II forcefully sits up!

M4 SOPMOD II: You were whining so much and taking up so much of my neural space I didn't even have the strength to stand up!

RO635: You were just playing dead! You wanted to slack off the moment the Military broke off the attack!

M4 SOPMOD II: I was using the time to rest! The Military didn't break off the attack, but...

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, get down!

...Boom!

M4 SOPMOD II: Military tanks! How did they get here so fast?!

RO635: We can't beat those things...

RO635: And...

RO635: Even the Commander's reinforcements wouldn't be able to beat them either!

Cx4 Storm: ...

Cx4 Storm: Is this...the end for us?

RO635: End of the line, SOP-II.

RO635: Can't you go berserk one last time?

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't. Even I...I know that I can't beat those things.

M4 SOPMOD II: And...for some reason I don't feel so unafraid of death anymore...

Cx4 Storm: (Grins) I'm sorry, SOP-II. It's because of us, isn't it?

M4 SOPMOD II: (Grins back) Well, we dragged each other down. I guess we're even, then?

RO635: Everyone's gathered together for the last time. At least use up all your ammo.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ammo? I've long since—

...Boom—!

Boom—! Boom—!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

...Several missiles wipe out the Military armored units in moments.

RO635: So you had some left after all.

M4 SOPMOD II: That wasn't me, that was...

...Click.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm fine... Wait, that sounds like...
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss you...? You're...
If choice 3 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: They're amazing, but who are you? Wait a minute...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Commander?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's the Commander—!!!

...

...Boom—!!! Boom—!!!

As the Griffin T-Dolls cheer, continuous waves of missiles drown the Military's mechanical and armored units in a sea of fire.

RO635: Looks like...we got lucky.

RO635: If I knew it would turn out like this, I would've saved my tears for now...

RO635: Although...it makes no difference now...

...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO...

RO635: Shut up...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, let me explain—

RO635: I want you to SHUT UP! Pay attention and walk!

...Thump!

SOP-II nearly collapses onto her knees.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II, are you alright?

M4 SOPMOD II: Ugh... I'm fine, I'm fine...

M4 SOPMOD II: Honestly, I can't control my body properly every time you kick up a fuss.

RO635: Whose fault is it that I have high-end electronic warfare modules?! Whose fault is it that I'm not the one controlling the body?!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tell the Commander - pffffft!

RO635: Didn't mean to, my ass! Look at your face! Just look at your face!

RO635: Didn't we agree not to tell the Commander I ended up like this?! You should have pretended I was dead!

M4 SOPMOD II: But the Commander was so relieved after I said that, so live with it, okay?

RO635: I should just kill myself...

Cx4 Storm: There there, you can change back to normal once we get back to HQ, RO.

RO635: How long is that going to take...

RO635: Cx4, how far away are we from the secure location that the Commander gave us?

Cx4 Storm: It's right in front of us, see—

RO635: SOP-II, look up, otherwise I can't see it.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yes, yes—

RO635: It looks like a temporary base, and it doesn't look like Griffin built it themselves.

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't think about that. It's good enough that we've got a place like this.

Cx4 Storm: Yeah, I'm glad we get to regroup with everyone! We finally get to breathe a sigh of relief!

RO635: ...Still, someone's helping us, right?

RO635: I mean, consider the heavy weapons the Commander used to support us. That's not the sort of thing a PMC ought to have.

M4 SOPMOD II: You know about that sort of thing, RO?

RO635: I used to handle a lot of law enforcement work. Of course I'd know.

RO635: After WWIII, civilian organizations aren't allowed to have military weapons without special permission.

Cx4 Storm: Mm, I know that. That's why we can only use these 50-year-old weapons, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Some T-Dolls have weapons which are more than 50 years old, hehe...

RO635: Don't look down on them when they have the Imprint to make up for their performance.

M4 SOPMOD II: But yeah, those heavy weapons mean we aren't an ordinary PMC anymore, right?

RO635: That much was obvious the moment the Military turned on us...

RO635: I wonder what happened to HQ...

Cx4 Storm: Huh? You don't know about them, RO?

Cx4 Storm: Oh...that's right...

RO635: What?

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah! RO, we're here! We're here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Look! It's the security zone! We're safe!

RO635: What happened at HQ?!

RO635: SOP-II! If you don't tell me, don't even think about stepping foot into the security zone!

M4 SOPMOD II: Arghhhh! My right leg is out of control!!

??: Shut it.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...?!

Everyone looks over and sees the T-Doll waiting up ahead.

RO635: You...you're...

416: What are you dawdling for? Regroup already!

M4 SOPMOD II: This T-Doll... Who is she again? She looks kinda familiar...?

416: You find too many people familiar. Hurry up and get over here.

416: The enemy is about to launch their next attack. We must get everyone out of here before that.

Cx4 Storm: Enemy? Has the Military fought their way here?

416: It's a new faction.

Cx4 Storm: A new faction?

Cx4 Storm: Not the Military?

Cx4 Storm: Not Sangvis Ferri either?

Cx4 Storm: Then who are they?

416: No idea.

416: All we know is that they want to kill us deader than dead.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh...is that so?

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, I don't mind as long as they're something I can kill.

416: That's the problem.

416: Those things...that want to kill us...

416: They're...unkillable.

...Five minutes later, the team encounters the unknown enemy blocking their path.

416: You see those white things, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hm... I've never seen them before. What are they?

416: I don't know, but they're after us. And their firepower is at least as good as the Military's.

M4 SOPMOD II: So we can only regroup with the Commander after we fight our way out of here?

416: We won't be able to meet up with the Commander for now. Griffin has their hands full fighting these enemies and they can't withdraw.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then we need to get rid of these enemies! No matter what they are, we can't let them hurt everyone!

416: (Has SOP-II...changed?)

416: We have the Commander and the HOCs. Taking care of enemies we see now isn't a problem.

416: Wipe them out as soon as possible. We need to mount a rescue at the next outpost.

M4 SOPMOD II: Roger! Leave to to me! RO, Cx4 Storm, this is the first battle we're fighting with the Commander watching since we came back, so make sure you put on a good show!

...An hour before the dirty bomb exploded, at the temporary Griffin Command Post.

Kalina: Attention, all T-Dolls!

Kalina: The Military has already breached the outer defensive perimeter of the Command Post! All combatants are to follow the briefed contingency plan and withdraw immediately!

Kalina: 9A-91, Thompson, both of your teams need to hold your defensive positions and secure the other Dolls' retreat!

9A-91: Where's the Commander? We need orders, otherwise we can't mount an effective counterattack!

Kalina: The Commander is still coordinating the battle and cannot move from their current position!

Thompson: We're fighting the damn Military here. We won't last long without the Boss around!

Kalina: Aaaaaahhhh, screw this! Let me give it a shot, then!

9A-91: You...?

Kalina: I've learned rudimentary tactics and commanding while serving with the Commander, y'know? I'm not that experienced, but I can at least serve to bolster your operational efficiency a little!

9A-91: That'll do, Miss Kalina.

Thompson: We'll leave the rest to you then.

Kalina: Let's move on forward, for Griffin, and for all of our friends!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

9A-91: Kalina, the Military's tanks have breached our defense outpost! Requesting permission to retreat?

Kalina: H-Hold on a minute! There's still a lot of us who haven't—

Thompson: There's too many tanks, our line of defense has been broken!

Kalina: I-Isn't there anything else you can do? Once the army takes those outposts, not only will everyone be stuck here, even the Commander—

Thompson: So it can't be helped, huh...

Thompson: Looks like... we'll just have to hold the line, then...

Kalina: What should I do...? Are we... really finished?

Kalina: Commander...

Kalina: Is tomorrow... never going to come for us...

...

My experience has taught me that miracles always happen when the end is nigh.

9A-91: That light! What IS that?

Or rather, that the end itself is a miracle, as long as you can survive it.

And at this very moment, it happened...

Thompson: Get down everybody!

Kalina: Woaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh—!

What seemed to be our end of days, was thwarted by a light at the end of the tunnel.

...

...An unknown amount of time later.

Kalina: (Coughs heavily)

Kalina: Is everyone alright? (Coughs)

Thompson: We're fine...

Thompson: But what was that just now?

9A-91: There was a green light, and then my neural cloud shut down for a bit, and then...

Thompson: Wait a minute...

Thompson: Our enemies...aren't moving any more? They've stopped responding!

9A-91: Are we... saved?

Kalina: What happened... (coughs)

Kalina: Well, whatever it was, this is great news... (coughs)

Kalina: Everyone, get up! Fill the gaps in the line of defense! The enemy might counterattack at any time!

Kalina: Kalin, we need a resupply ASAP!

Kalina: Right, I'll get MP40's logistics team on it (cough)!

Kalina: Miss Kalin, your reaction isn't normal, don't tell me that was...

Kalina: I'm fine, maybe I'm just a little allergic... (coughs)

Kalina: Wait a minute... This stuff... don't tell me this stuff is...

Kalina suddenly realizes the true nature of that green light just now, and hurriedly makes a call.

Kalina: Commander! Commander, are you alright? Were you caught in that Collapse Fluid explosion just now?!

Kalina: Commander, Commander, please answer me!

Kalina: Commander—!

...

But sometimes, survival does not imply being lucky.

When we leave Hell, it is hard to tell if the light before us is that of Heaven, a dream, or a memory of the truth...

??: Can you see me?

??: Can you hear what I am saying?

I feel dizzy as I wake up to an uncomfortable light and the beeping of machines monitoring my vital signs...

??: If you can speak, then you do not need to move your head to respond.

??: Look at us. How do you feel now?

...Three hours later.

??: Greetings, Griffin Commander.

??: Now... you need to remain calm. Do not panic.

??: I have something to say to you. Is that alright?

??: You must be calm. You have been in a coma all this while...

??: ...Yes, I understand, you must want to know how long you were unconscious.

??: You have been comatose for...

??: ...Nine weeks.

...At this very moment, I am certain that I have gone deeper into Hell.

...One day later.

??: ...Nine weeks ago, you were severely injured by the detonation of a large Collapse Fluid bomb.

??: We treated you and allowed you to regain consciousness.

??: Griffin Commander, now that you are awake, let us begin.

...

??: ...

They do not answer me. They simply continue their monologue.

When I think back, I realize that I knew them. They appeared after the dirty bomb explosion, and then...

...

But this is my first time observing them up close. They look very familiar — am I imagining things?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

The Nytos do not answer, but their gazes grow more focused as they stare at me.

The way they look at me makes me very uncomfortable, more so than the looks in the eyes of the first batch of experimental Dolls.

There is no emotion or curiosity there. They're just...looking at me...

What am I in their eyes? Perhaps I am nothing more than a form that needs to be filled up for work.
If choice 2 was picked

The Nytos do not respond in any way, like a group of emotionless machines that lack any personality.

I had seen them on the battlefield before, killing all targets in sight... my T-Dolls, perhaps, or maybe even me...

They are an enemy worth hating more than even the Military, but right now... they are not doing anything.
If choice 3 was picked

??: You will have one, but not in this place.
If choice 3 was picked

The Nytos speak, and their voices make me doubt my ears.

I've heard these voices before... but I can't remember where exactly, and it makes me feel uncomfortable...

Perhaps it's because I've just woken up and my head isn't too clear, or perhaps it's because I really need a glass of water...

Nyto: Griffin Commander, you are now a prisoner of our Master.

I don't like their voices. I can't say why they repulse me. The words they speak sound very real, very hollow... and very familiar.

Nyto: The only way you will gain your freedom is by telling us everything you know about what happened after the Collapse Fluid explosion.

...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto: We will check your statement against the facts. If any contradictions arise, we will force you to amend it through punishment.
If choice 2 was picked

The Nytos do not answer. They remain completely still. Even their faces do not betray their refusal to answer. Like a coin tossed into a wishing well, my question is met with silence.

Nyto: Now, get up.

Nyto: Complete this order in ten seconds, or we will consider you to be harboring rebellious intentions and will employ coercive measures on you.

Nyto: 10.

Nyto: 9.

Nyto: 8.

7.

6.

...Suddenly, the puppets fall silent.

And then...

Nyto?: Commander?

Only one Nyto is staring at me. The look in her eyes is completely different from before.

Nyto?: Long time no see.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

The Doll draws a line down over her left eye with her index finger.

What does this imply? I think for a while, and then I think I have the answer...
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto?: Are you into that kind of thing, Commander? However, we can't do that now. I'm here to help you. All you need to do is listen.

Nyto?: I didn't expect these bodies to have such complex neural networks. It took me a long time to identify and hack their simulated consciousnesses.

Nyto?: Still, I can temporarily invade these Nytos' electronic synapses, and I hacked all four of them this time round in order to cover up the fact that we've managed to get into their system.

Nyto?: However, taking control of all these Nytos is a huge drain. I prepared for an entire week just for this moment. I won't be able to do it next time.

Nyto?: Each hack only allows me to control my target for two minutes, so I'll cut to the chase — we're here to rescue you, Commander.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto?: Sorry, it took us a long time to find this place, and... it took me a long time to fully recover from the previous battle.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto?: Oh my, I'm touched. But you should be more concerned about yourself now, Commander.

Nyto?: What you need to know is that these Nytos were tasked with obtaining information from your body. They tried scanning your brain for data, but that clearly failed, so they had to question you in person.

Nyto?: We're currently preparing to infiltrate this place. You need to delay these puppets for as long as possible during this time.

Nyto?: They asked you about what happened during the previous mission, right?

Nyto?: Whether you tell them the truth or make something up, we need you to delay them for as long as possible. We need to make a lot of preparations to ensure the operation goes off without a hitch.

Nyto?: I know you'll suffer as a result. These "puppets" were created to force confessions from people, but they need your cooperation to achieve their aim.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto?: Humans are good at that. I'm sure you can do it.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto?: Then try your best, Commander. It doesn't matter what you say, just stall for time.
If choice 3 was picked

Nyto?: Oh? Really now?
If choice 3 was picked

The Nyto narrows her eyes.
If choice 3 was picked

Nyto?: I've heard some rumors. You'll have to tell me all about it the next time we meet.

Nyto?: Time's almost up. I've planted a miniature transmitter on you. It can only send and receive at short ranges.

Nyto?: After that, I'll hack into one of these four Nytos and save you from the inside.

Nyto?: The situation will be very dangerous and you may need to fight as well. I found a pistol, which I've hidden under your restraints. You DO know how to use one, right?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto?: Hehe, my apologies, Commander. I look forward to your performance.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto?: We'll try to avoid that, but I can't make any guarantees.

Nyto?: This is also a battlefield, Commander. You can't be soft-hearted here.

Nyto?: Also, I'm not sure which of these Nytos I'll be able to hack into. When the time comes, I'll say a code phrase so I don't get hurt by accident when you're fighting back.

Nyto?: Listen closely. The phrase is...

Nyto?: "I've brought misfortune."

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto?: I just like it.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto?: You don't need to do anything. Just don't hit her by accident.

Nyto?: Got that? Once you hear the code phrase, you'll know that Nyto's under my control. You don't need to respond, just don't kill her, because she's going to help us open the room from the inside and ensure that we can rescue you ASAP. This is crucial.

Nyto?: Well, I guess you already understand. In any case, don't worry, Commander. We'll get you out of there.

Nyto?: Until then, you'll just have to grin and bear it. I'm going to release control now. Good luck.

Nyto: 5.

Nyto: 4.

Nyto: Very good. You carried out the order in only 6 seconds.

Nyto: Now, we shall proceed to the interrogation room.

The Nytos lead me to the interrogation room.

To be precise, it's less like leading me and more like frog-marching me along. I see many things during my journey.

...In the interrogation room.

Nyto: Griffin Commander. Do not attempt to struggle against your restraints. The only thing you may move is your mouth.

Nyto: We require you to provide your memories. For starters, we need to know how you survived on the battlefield.

Nyto: We need more details. We need to know how you survived and reached that safe house. Tell us.

Nyto: We need the truth. Don't get it wrong.

Indeed, the only thing I'm certain of is that I survived the battlefield.

...That I had survived the explosion.

...

A great force had awakened me back then. I struggled free of something, and then fell heavily to the ground.

I looked at the ceiling. Time seemed to slow down, while my breathing grew more and more rapid as I thrashed around on the ground...

Just then, I noticed two dark silhouettes approaching me. I instinctively lay down and closed my eyes.

Where was I? What had happened? Who were those two silhouettes? Were they enemies? Or perhaps...

Sagacious female voice: ...Commander? Commander, are you awake?

Choleric female voice: Oi! Commander—!

Choleric female voice: Wake the hell up, scumbag Commander!

Choleric female voice: Otherwise I'll dump you on the ground and drag you to Kalin, how do you like that?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Choleric female voice: Don't play dumb if you're awake! Open your eyes and get up!
If choice 1 was picked

Sagacious female voice: Don't shake the Commander. You mustn't subject human heads to vigorous motion.
If choice 2 was picked

Choleric female voice: That's 'cause your breathing changed! I can feel that!
If choice 2 was picked

Sagacious female voice: Given your breathing and line of sight, I could tell where you were looking.
If choice 3 was picked

Choleric female voice: Of course we are! We're dyed-in-the-wool Griffin T-Dolls!
If choice 3 was picked

Sagacious female voice: Commander, this place is safe and there's no need to worry...for now.

M82A1: Pleased to meet you. I am Griffin Tactical Doll M82A1.

M82A1: It's normal for you not to know me, but I know you very well. I've been watching you for very long now.

M870: I'm M870, from Griffin.

M870: Are you up now, scumbag?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M82A1: I was just following my orders to take you from the battlefield to this safe house.
If choice 1 was picked

M870: Don't think we like it, though. We had to come all the way to this shithole because of you!
If choice 2 was picked

M82A1: Miss Kalina gave us the coordinates and the two of us came here.
If choice 2 was picked

M870: That's right, you're going to praise us for it, right? You'd better, we could have died here because of you!
If choice 3 was picked

M82A1: We're still in your command room. You were unconscious from the radiation when we found you.
If choice 3 was picked

M870: We're not far from the contaminated zone. This place is well-hidden, but it's not going to be safe if anyone finds out about it.

M82A1: We gave you some "treatment". You should have regained the ability to move for the time being.

M870: Or rather... we gave you a shot in the arm. Adrenaline, of course. I didn't expect it to be so effective.

M82A1: Still, you were not badly contaminated to begin with. If you receive proper treatment for the other symptoms in time, you should be able to recover within three months, although that may vary depending on your personal lifestyle and habits.

M870: You'd better cherish the life we gave you. Now leave this place with us and link up with Kalina. Hurry!

M870 prepared to help me up, and I made to grab her.

Just then, I heard a clear transmission through the endless sea of static from the comms equipment.

Mature woman's voice: Has Griffin left already...

...

Mature woman's voice: Is this... how it ends...?

Persica's voice: Ange...

Mature woman's voice: Haha, then it can't be helped. I didn't expect things would turn out like this...

M82A1: Commander... aren't you coming?

After hearing that voice, I knew my work here wasn't done yet.

Nyto: Your statement just now and the information you provided earlier matches our records. We can continue our work.

Nyto: You could have withdrawn at the time, but you did not. Instead, you remained where you were and helped to evacuate your other personnel.

Nyto: That is why you possess the information we wish to know.

Nyto: Now, tell us the reason why you did this.

...

M870: What are you saying? You want to stay here, Commander? Are you insane?

M82A1: Human, what are you thinking?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M870: You do know that you're a hell of a lot more important to Griffin than those Dolls and humans, right?

M870: Still, that's the kind of person you are... which is why you're so important...
If choice 2 was picked

M82A1: You can't just leave your faithful logistics officer behind, right?

M82A1: We ought to think of a solution for that, although I do admit... the situation in the Griffin base is critical, and I'm not sure...
If choice 3 was picked

M82A1: Is that person so important? Why are you doing this, human?
If choice 3 was picked

M870: These are the boss' words, but I'll use them to remind you — Commander, you can bring your ideals into war, but you have to face the facts when you're on the battlefield!

M870: Still, that's fine. You don't have to say any more, I understand. You're staying behind, regardless of whether you live or die to help the remaining people fall back. Is that it?

M870: Still, I'd like to remind you that our mission is to get you to the base's airfield and put you on an evacuation chopper, Commander.

M870: Miss Kalin kept nagging about how this was my top priority, even if I had to knock you out... in all honesty, maybe I should.

M82A1: You have let your emotions go to your head, Commander.

M82A1: Although, I believe that is the difference between humans and us Dolls.

M870: M82A1? You...

M82A1: You cannot disobey that order, M870, because the Commander is also protecting Miss Kalin and Griffin.

M82A1: This is our most important mission, more important than any other order we've received so far.

M870: Hmph...

M870: Eh, whatever. It's just extra overtime, anyway.

M82A1: There is an intact command platform and communications equipment here. Relax and give your commands. We will find a suitable terrain from which to protect you.

M870: Don't disappoint me, scumbag. Dying for your arrogant ideals is the most laughable way to go.

M82A1 and M870 pushed open the door and left.

M82A1: Show me what you can do today... as a human who's trusted by all Dolls.

After that, I got to work, completing the final evacuation of the battlefield.

...

Nyto: Your answer tallies with our information for the time being.

Nyto: We now require more recent information.

Nyto: We need to know the location of M4 SOPMOD II of the AR Team. Tell us what she experienced during the mission.

Nyto: Answer us, Griffin Commander.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto: We know she was not.

Nyto: She survived. We witnessed it with our own eyes. So tell us what happened to her.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto: She was in contact with you. We know that she took part in the final operation to rescue you. She must have told you something.
If choice 3 was picked

Nyto: You are attempting to anger us. It will not work. However, from another point of view you are admitting that she is still alive.

Nyto: You cannot hide it any further. Tell us what that T-Doll experienced. We need to know everything, from the beginning to the end.

Nyto: ...Tell us. That is the only way you will survive.

I consider that I only have a few minutes to spin a tale, to decide whether the story would make us look like heroes, a bunch of luckless fools, or just a pack of corpses.

I also know what lying entails for me, but I don't care. What I need is time, and at the very least they will spare my life. I can imagine what else they can do up to that point, but I can take it.

Hopefully I will still think the same way after they start working me over...

...One hour after the dirty bomb went off, at Griffin's temporary outpost.

Thompson: ...Now you see.

Thompson: There's no way we can get out of this, Boss Kalin.

Kalina: No, we're waiting for you to come back!

Kalina: There must be a way! We—

Thompson: We can't keep this up for long. These bastards are a bunch of monsters, pure and simple.

Kalina: There's been no intel on them at all... Just what on earth...are "they"?

Thompson: Unfortunately, we haven't been able to determine what they are or where they came from even having been locked in a stalemate with them for so long.

Thompson: All we know is that they appeared all of a sudden for one reason: to destroy us.

Kalina: ...But why? I don't get it.

Kalina: Where the hell did they come from? Why are they attacking us...?

Kalina: Not to mention...why now, of all time...?

Kalina: And we...almost got everyone out of here safely...

Thompson: How's the base doing so far?

Kalina: Backup circuits no. 13, 15 and 27 are all damaged... We only have two strongpoints left in the outskirts other than you.

Kalina: All Griffin forces have already withdrawn from the theater so Miss Helian probably has no way of giving us support...

Thompson: Ha, looks like we're done for.

Kalina: We'll think of something; just hang in there!

Thompson: Just kidding. I'll hold out till the bitter end, of course.

Thompson: But my squad needs ammo - both large caliber and small, and you just said—

Kalina: I'll find a way to have a logistics team send them over!

Thompson: That's too risky. They fire indiscriminately on all moving targets.

Kalina: The Commander will come up with a safe route, but that'll take some time so hold on tight.

Kalina: Also, don't expect too much supply. I'm sorry but our inventory is running very low...

Thompson: Every little bit helps. I'll make sure every round finds its way into an enemy's skull.

Kalina: Please, you must survive until our reinforcements arrive!

...A new transmission is patched in.

9A-91: Miss Kalina, status report - we eliminated three detachments from the unknown enemy during our last encounter.

9A-91: The outpost is safe for the time being. We have suffered intermediate losses. Please dispatch ten Dummies to assist us in patching up the line of defense.

Kalina: 9A-91, we...don't have any more Dummies.

9A-91: ...In that case I'd like to request retreating two T-dolls.

9A-91: They have both sustained severe damage in their mainframe. If they do not receive repair...

Kalina: Understood, permission granted. Send them back to us immediately.

9A-91: Much obliged. Executing order at once.

Kalina: Do you know what's the situation with Python's defense echelon? I haven't been able to contact them for a while.

9A-91: Unclear. We were separated.

9A-91: Due to unstable reception, we have temporarily shut down part of our access to the Zener Protocol to avoid Parapluie infection. We are not capable of synchronizing with T-Dolls that are too far from us.

9A-91: However, their defense line appears to be holding from what I can see so they should still be able to maintain it.

Kalina: Roger that. Please keep defending your post. I'll think of a way to send you reinforcements!

9A-91: For everyone's sake, not one step back.

...Transmission terminated.

Kalina: Still...how do I even give them support...?

Kalina: The situation is beyond FUBAR. Can I even get out of this alive...?

Kalina: Being a logistics officer is very safe, they say. How...is this any different than how things used to be...?

...Kalina flips her diary open.

Kalina: If I'm killed in action today...

Kalina: I want to be reincarnated...

Kalina: ...as a fat orange tabby...

Kalina: Hiding in the small bush outside some office building... Other than bringing other stray cats to the feeding spot, I won't need to work at all...

Kalina: Just meow along and—

Kalina: Huh?! A transmission from the Commander!

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

Kalina: Haha... Just...a little...
If choice 2 was picked

Kalina: All T-Dolls in charge of defense are in key positions, just waiting for transport to arrive.
If choice 3 was picked

Kalina: The outposts were attacked by an unknown force. Our defense is stretched really thin...

Kalina: In any case, Miss Ange's intel is accurate. Enemy forces are relatively sparse here. I have also been supplying the defense teams you dispatched. Hopefully we'll make it till extration flight gets here...

Kalina: Huh? Another mission for me?

Kalina: The legendary "Not Found" squad?

Kalina: R...right...if it's for a mission...

Kalina: I have picked up their IFF signals. I'll input them into the command system so that our T-Dolls won't attack them—

??: So this is our liaison?

Kalina: Huh?!!

Kalina: W-who's there?!

416: Are you Fräulein...Kalina, the logistics officer here?

Kalina: That's me, alright...

Kalina: Concurrently manning many other positions as well 'cause we're a bit understaffed here, haha...

416: Then please help us.

Kalina: What? Help? Sure, my job is to help T-Dolls... Wait a minute...

Kalina: I've never seen you before... You—

416: ...

Kalina: Oh! You're 416, aren't you?! I remember now! From Operation Hypothermia!

416: Guten Tag.

416: Not being able to wipe a human's memory seems to be a huge security risk.

Kalina: A-are you still trying to do that?!

416: A physically induced memory loss is worth attempting, although such orders were never given.

Kalina: That's good to hear, haha...

416: Have you not started the retreat?

Kalina: We're still waiting for transport to arrive, but we don't know when exactly it...

416: I trust the Commander has informed you about us?

Kalina: Ah, the Commander just briefed me. I was just about to input your IFF sig...

Kalina: Hold on! I haven't done that yet, so how did you get in here?! There are six layers of defense lines out there—

416: So what?

Kalina: S-so...

Kalina: So that's the reason you're known as the "Not Found" squad...

Kalina: I finally understand why the other T-Dolls fear you so much...

416: And you? Do you fear us, too...?

Kalina: Ahaha...of course not! I'm sure those are all just rumors, haha...

416: Regardless of what you've heard about us in the past, we're just Griffin T-dolls seeking help today.

Kalina: Right, I only know that you're an elite Griffin T-Doll, everything else is way above my paygrade.

Kalina: And since the Commander has given the order, I'll do everything I can to help you.

Kalina: But come to think of it, the Commander's exact words were, "Squad 404 needs your help", so where are your teammates?

Gr G11: (Pants) 41...6...

Gr G11: You were too fast...I can't catch up at all...

416: You're too slow, Gr G11. Did you crawl all the way here? Where are 9 and 45?

Gr G11: 9 moved 45 to a temporary repair site...and Dier is doing a remote inspection on her...

Gr G11: Even if you're worried about 45, you didn't have to run so fast— Ow ow ow ow...

416: Stop spouting nonsense from your stupid mouth!

Kalina: Is this your teammate?

416: Kinda. This is Gr G11, our snipe—

Kalina: She's...so cute!

Kalina: How is such a cute T-Doll also on the "Not Found" squad?!

Gr G11: Ugh...that doesn't sound like a compliment at all...

Gr G11: Why are all the humans I run into so weird...?

416: How dare you say that... She's the logistics officer here, you know?

416: If she wants, she can remove your Imprint this instant and throw you back out onto the street.

Gr G11: Huh?! R-really?! Nein, nein, nein, please don't s-s-scrap me!

Kalina: I won't.

Kalina: Besides, only the Commander has the authority to order a T-Doll dismantled.

Gr G11: Phew... I see...

416: Look at your stupid face; you don't seem anxious at all.

416: Right, bring us to the repair site. Hurry.

Gr G11: Okay, okay! Stop kicking me!

416: Please come with us, Fräulein Kalina. We aren't authorized to allocate resources.

Kalina: What do you need me for...? To save your teammate?

416: Ja. Please, you must save her.

Kalina: ...

...Kalina follows 416 and Gr G11 to the temporary repair site.

416: Are all those T-Dolls in the queue waiting for repair?

Kalina: That's right... The previous battle took a heavy toll on us.

Kalina: On top of that, everyone's neural clouds lost connection to the Griffin's main server, making it impossible to upload their memory.

Kalina: That's why I'm trying to at least restore their mobility so they can hold out until our transport plane gets here.

416: Griffin's neural cloud upload isn't functional right now, you said?

Kalina: Yeah... Our server has been very unstable ever since the Military launched their attack against us.

Kalina: Then the massive explosion completely disconnected us.

Kalina: We haven't been able to get in touch with either HQ or Helian... Our other echelons withdrew yesterday, only the Commander stayed behind...

416: Massive explosion... Was that the dirty bomb with Collapse Fluid...?

Kalina: Dirty bomb?

416: N...nothing. What's the status of the repair site?

Kalina: Very bad...

Kalina: We don't have enough spare parts, the only option for ones we can't repair is to have their neural cloud data backed up.

Kalina: Even so, we can't guarantee all the T-Dolls can be backed up as we only have a limited number of data blocks...

416: If that ends up being the case, you'll have to resort to physical backup...

Kalina: But that method—

Kalina: ...Whoa!

...A T-Doll dashes out from the repair room all of a sudden.

Kalina: Sorry sorry, are you alright?

AK-74U: Even if I wasn't, I should be the one to apologize.

AK-74U: Kalin, do you know where AK-47's logistics team has gone?

Kalina: Oh, 9A-91 asked for someone to pick up the wounded from her echelon so I sent them to carry out the mission.

AK-74U: Then I'm going over to help.

Kalina: Uh, wait, you literally just came out of the repair bay—

...AK-74U leaves paying no heed to her.

Kalina: Oh...she left...

Kalina: Uh, sorry, Miss 416. Where were we?

416: Is that T-Doll always so rude to you?

Kalina: I'm used to it; everyone has their own quirks.

416: You're okay with that?

Kalina: Well...I'm not the one on the frontline, after all.

UMP9: Oh, Gr G11! And 416! Where the hell did you run off to?!

Gr G11: 416 found the logistics officer here. I almost died of exhaustion trying to catch up with her!

Kalina: Just call me Kalin. Is this the injured T-Doll?

UMP9: That's right. UMP45 is our squad leader. She protected us from an explosion and took the brunt of it...

Kalina: Hmm...this is very severe damage... Please back off a bit. I'd like to inspect her condition.

UMP9: S-sure!

Kalina: This doesn't look good at all... Her torso support structure snapped into two; the right arm got torn off by shrapnel; more shrapnels buried in the other limbs...

Kalina: I can't detect her power supply; are both the main and auxillary circuits damaged?

UMP9: Ja... The only thing still working is the backup power supply on the neural core itself. We've shut down most of her systems.

Kalina: Is that so...? That's very decisive of you, but the damage is critical...

Kalina: I don't recommend a repair, especially when the power supply isn't functional.

416: How about a physical backup? At least that'll make sure we can transfer her data...

UMP9: ...A physical backup?

416: Fräulein Kalina has a few data blocks that can be used to store neural data. We can transfer 45's neural cloud in there for now and find a way to get her a new body...

UMP45: Ugh... Wait...

UMP9: 45! Didn't I tell you not to come out of hibernation mode? If you use up all the battery...

UMP45: No...I refuse.

Kalina: Um... Miss 45, the extent of your damage makes repair very difficult.

Kalina: Not to mention your parts... don't seem to be standard parts that Griffin uses. A neural transplant is your best choice at the moment.

UMP45: Transplant...

UMP45: You mean replacing this body...?

416: That's the only way to save you.

416: It's not like you're more entitled to their already limited data blocks. There are a lot of other damaged T-Dolls here.

UMP45: No...

UMP45: I can't...undergo a neural transplant now...

UMP9: Huh? But why, 45?!

UMP9: Even now, you're still...

UMP45: "That" chunk of data isn't stored in my neural cloud... If I'm moved to a new body...

416: Do you wanna die, 45?

416: Isn't your life worth more than all of us combined?

UMP45: (Sneers) Are our lives...worth anything at all?

UMP45: In any case, this body...is more important than my own life...

UMP9: 45, are you really...not doing it?

...UMP45 struggles to shake her head.

416: How about having 9 backup your oh-so-precious data? Data-sharing should be pretty easy since you're the same model, right?

UMP9: No... I...

416: 9, you won't be in combat for a while. You should have enough storage to—

UMP9: 45 and I...aren't of the same model...

416: What...?

416: Seriously...just how many more secrets are the two of you keeping...?

...416 lets out a sigh.

416: Whatever... Looks like we're getting a new squad leader.

UMP45: Isn't that...what you've always wanted...?

416: What I wanted is to finish you off myself, not watching you die here like a piece of trash.

UMP45: Ha... Don't worry, you'll have to wait a long time...

...UMP45 turns toward Kalin.

UMP45: Fräulein Kalin...I know I'm being unreasonable, but I would very much like to keep this body. Please think of a way...

Kalina: A-alright, let me see if I can patch up the power supply system first...

Kalina: Don't worry! The Commander asked me to do everything I can to help you, and I don't plan on letting you down!

UMP45: Danke schön... And please relay my gratitude to the Commander as well. I—

...There is suddenly a commotion from outside the repair room.

??: Outta the way!!

Kalina: W-what is it now?!

AK-74U: Clear the way! Move the wounded to the repair room!

...Seven or eight T-Dolls are carried into the room.

Kalina: 74U? What happened?!

AK-74U: Kalin, I've been looking for you everywhere!

AK-74U: We got ambushed when we were picking up the wounded from 9A-91's team and suffered heavy losses!

AK-74U: The enemies appeared out of nowhere and punched a hole right through our defense line! Judging from the silhouettes, they were not from either Sangvis Ferri or the Military!

Kalina: Not the Military? Then...they're the unknown enemies... Did they already breach the perimeter?!

Kalina: ...Commander! Do you copy? Our outpost were attacked!

AK-74U: That's right, the attackers are currently storming our strongpoint!

AK-74U: There aren't many of them, but they've cut off communication between us and our defense echelons out there!

Kalina: Commander, can you see the situation of our echelons? Please give your orders!

Kalina: Sure...

Kalina: Alright, I'll support you from here!

AK-74U: What did the Commander say?

Kalina: Apparently new troops are coming to reinforce us, but it'll take some time for them to get here.

Kalina: Right now, we need to organize a fireteam to help out the defense echelons out there, but our numbers... Who else is still operational?

AK-74U: I can still go; are there any other T-dolls still mobile?

...A few T-Dolls step forward unsteadily.

AK-74U: Right, you lot come with me.

Kalina: Are those the only T-Dolls we have left? That's a bit...

416: Fräulein Kalina.

416: Are there more openings for this fireteam?

UMP9: ...416?

Kalina: Huh?

Kalina: Are you...in?

416: If this place falls, we can't get out of here either.

Kalina: Then please! I'm updating your IFF signal to the system right now!

416: Danke. Please also establish a direct line of communication to the Commander; I would like to acquire more combat intel.

Kalina: Huh...? Oh, okay! I've set up an encrypted channel; it should be interfaced via your IFF signal now.

AK-74U: Direct communication with the Commander, eh? Not just any T-Doll gets such special treatment.

AK-74U: Who the hell are you?

416: Just a Griffin T-doll temporarily back on duty.

416: You're AK-74U, correct? I hope you won't object to my involvement.

AK-74U: Why would I? We could use all the help we can get.

AK-74U: Just don't die too quickly, I won't mourn for you.

Gr G11: Sh...should I also come and help?

416: We'll be dashing about all the time. With your mobility...just forget it and stay here.

Gr G11: Hnng...

416: 9, Gr G11 and you are the last line of defense.

416: Keep Fräulein Kalina safe; she will fix 45. Leave the rest to me.

UMP9: Sure...

UMP9: But 416...

UMP9: You...you'll come back, right?

416: ...

416: I told you. I won't drop dead before I finish her off myself.

416: Isn't that right, 45?

UMP45: ...That's entirely up to you.

...

416: Commander, this is T-Doll 416. You know I'm here, let's cut to the chase.

416: I am synchronized to Griffin's intel database. Allow me to reiterate the information we have so far.

416: Griffin T-Dolls were attacked by unknown enemies while organizing a retreat. The identity of these enemies are unclear, but judging from their appearance and armaments, we can basically rule out Sangvis Ferri and the Military.

416: Their equipment shows that they are even more technologically advanced than the military units we've seen so far. Furthermore, these enemies seem to be low-tier models. It is highly likely that we will run into even more troublesome enemies.

416: A fireteam has been assembled. Our main objective is to support the T-Doll echelons along the outer defensive line.

416: Griffin T-Dolls are garrisoned in three strongpoints at the moment. We have to help them repel enemy attacks and bring them back.

416: For now, our priority is to eliminate enemy units that are inside the wire before we can get to the defense line. The situation is very dire both in and out the outpost. Please give your orders.

416: Also, if you don't' mind, allow me to serve as your adjutant. I may not be a command-type T-Doll, but I can more or less coordinate a fight on the scene.

416: ...Are you sure you find the arrangements acceptable?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

416: A wise decision. But of course, I understand this is only temporary.
If choice 2 was picked

416: You may not know this, but out of all the T-Dolls here, I probably have the most experience in actual combat. I strongly advise you to accept my suggestion.
If choice 3 was picked

416: I don't mind a joke like that...unless you can actually make me stay.

416: Now, please give your orders, o temporary Commander of mine.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...End of operation. The fireteam eliminated the unknown enemies that invaded the base.

...While the Fairies are patching up the opening, 416 studies the remains on the floor with a deep frown.

416: ...White enemies. Certainly never seen them before.

AK-74U: See? Who knows where they're from.

416: ...But this is beyond strange. Even I have no clue.

AK-74U: Ha, how arrogant.

AK-74U: But I've got to admit you did pretty well just now.

416: So do you trust me now?

AK-74U: Sorry about that. You really are an elite T-Doll.

AK-74U: Looking at your baby face, I honestly thought you were just a random decorative Doll cleaned out from some warehouse to bolster our numbers.

416: I wish I were just some decoration. Wouldn't have to do everything myself.

416: Still, those enemies were much weaker than I expected. Were they the main force?

AK-74U: Don't be ridiculous, these are just a nuisance, the ones that attacked us before were on a completely different level.

AK-74U: The real ones...are unkillable.

416: Unkillable?

AK-74U: Literally, you are not gonna like facing them, enough about that, we've got to move.

416: Wait, so why did they send these low-level units here?

AK-74U: Does that matter? So they sent some cannon fodder this way. That's no big deal, right?

416: We're facing enemies even more unfathomable than the Military. With this level of technology, they won't make reckless moves.

416: I don't recommend setting off right away. We should wait till the base is completely restored—

AK-74U: Huh? Are you joking?

AK-74U: That'd be too late! 9A-91 is still waiting for us!

416: Even so, we can't risk it. The enemy was only testing the water, the real attack will follow!

AK-74U: Every step we take now is a risk!

AK-74U: Listen, 416, time is our most limited resource. My friends are still taking bullets for us on the frontline out there, I can't just leave them for dead!

416: Don't let your feelings get the better of you! You're a Tactical Doll, so obey your orders!

AK-74U: Oh, sure! I'll listen to orders, let the Commander give the order! Order me to stay here!

416: 74U, you...go ballistic at the mention of your friends. Are all T-Dolls at Griffin as undisciplined as you?

AK-74U: I'm not you. I wouldn't leave behind my friends and go on a suicide mission alone.

416: ...Do you have any idea what you're talking about?

AK-74U: You don't even have friends, do you?

AK-74U: I know who you are, Squad 404.

416: ...

416: So what?

416: You don't actually know me, Griffin trash.

...!

...74U grabs 416 by the collar.

AK-74U: I'm not trash! Do you know wh—

416: Watch out!

...416 pushes AK-74U away.

...Bang bang! The spot where they used to be is showered by bullets.

AK-74U: ...! 416!

416: I'm fine! Just a scrape!

416: Protect the Fairies! We're falling back to the construction site!

...New enemy troops come pouring in from the opening, 416 struggles to hold them back.

AK-74U: It-it's them! The main force!

AK-74U: Just like last time, our bullets have no effect!

416: At least slow them down!

416: Where's the rest of our group?! Bring up anyone that can still move!

AK-74U: Got it!

AK-74U: And 416, about what happened just now—

416: This isn't the time! Do your job! Move it already!

416: Sheesh. Griffin is always...full of idiots dragging me down.

...In the Griffin repair room.

UMP9: Sier! Answer me, Sier!

UMP9: Have you guys figured anything out yet? Why can't 45...

UMP9: ...be rebooted at all?!

Sier: Uh, um... Please don't panic...

Sier: It's just that...well...

Dier: Argh, shut up! I shut down her Level II consciousness to save power!

Dier: Stop bothering me; I'm remotely giving her emergency maintenance right now!

Gr G11: Will 45 live?

Dier: The Griffin logistics officer did a good job.

Dier: However, even with the minimal power supply secured, we can only save a few core modules and buy her some time.

Dier: You'll need to move her to a more advanced repair facility for me to sort this out completely!

UMP9: There's no such facility here. We'll need transport to move 45. Could you arrange for that, Sier?

Sier: I'm sorry...but your coordinates are way too dangerous at the moment.

Sier: According to intel, the area is embroiled in conflict among different forces and heavily contaminated by Collapse Fluid. Your temporary base is also under attack...

UMP9: It can't be done?

Sier: Well, it can, anyone willing to take such risks is bound to be pretty expensive...

Sier: As you know, our capital reserve...

UMP9: I don't care how much it costs; just get the best extraction team here ASAP!

Sier: U-understood! I'll do that right awa—

...Beep!

416: 9, how's 45 doing?!

UMP9: I was just talking to Sier and Dier. 45 will probably have to be transferred soon!

416: You can't do that now! The enemies have breached the base!

UMP9: Is it that bad?!

416: We're buying time for the Commander's reinforcements, though I'm not sure what exactly that is.

416: In any case, keep 45 safe with Gr G11, they might break through our defense lines any time.

UMP9: I will, but 416...

UMP9: You know that you no longer owe 45 anything, right?

416: I know. She said so.

UMP9: So...is it time?

416: All I want is to prove myself.

416: But first of all, I must make sure you all survive.

UMP9: Then... we are counting on you, we WILL save 45 here.

Gr G11: Are you alright over there, 416?

416: The Commander is here, and we have a lot of T-Dolls.

416: Make sure you stay alive. We'll meet again.

Gr G11: Even though we don't know when, right?

Gr G11: I just hope...we'll get to fight together one last time.

416: Not this time. I can't carry you on my back anymore.

...Transmission terminated.

416: ...Not to mention, you won't be of much help here anyway.

416: Scheiße! How the hell can we penetrate their armor?! And what the hell are they?!

AK-74U: Save your bullets, this is exactly what I meant. They have force fields designed especially to deflect our ammunition. It's practically impossible to get through them.

AK-74U: But thanks to you, we can at least organize a counterstrike behind the defense line.

416: You're very welcome.

...Bang bang!

AK-74U: 416, I just want to say that I'm very sorry about what I said. Also...

AK-74U: You're pretty dependable...and a lot more capable than all the T-Dolls on the base now.

416: Just do your job; I only care about orders on the field.

AK-74U: Now that you mention it, 416, you remember the Commander's order?

416: Draw the enemies' attention, slow them down, and don't let them find our extraction point.

AK-74U: That's right, if we can't do that, it's over.

AK-74U: 416, our mission is to buy time till the Commander's "reinforcements" get here, not to destroy the enemy, so I don't think we have to stand our ground here—

416: We still don't know when the so-called "reinforcements" will arrive so count on getting lucky.

416: Besides, we don't even know how much we can count on them.

AK-74U: In any case, we can't win on our own, right?

416: One moment you wanna charge in blindly, the next you wanna retreat like a coward, what kind of T-doll are you?

...Bang bang!

AK-74U: (Sighs) I was just making a suggestion, since you said so, I'll stay with you.

AK-74U: I just think we should trust the Commander. After all, you don't have a command module, and this place is not the most defendable...

416: The Commander is still busy mobilizing these "reinforcements". Once that's done, I'll hear from...

...Click.

AK-74U: Ah, here they come.

416: Fire at will, don't fall back.

...

416: Commander, we can't stay holed up here!

416: We can barely hold them off for now, they'll break through other strongpoints in no time!

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

416: Please hurry up! The extraction point will be done for once the enemy realizes that our numbers are pitifully small!
If choice 2 was picked

416: Whatever you have planned, I hope it works!
If choice 3 was picked

416: I sure hope this won't be the last order I ever get!

416: Anyway, we'll obey your order and slow the enemies down...so that the reinforcements can get here safely!

416: But Commander, what exactly are these "reinforcements"? Can they really fight off the enemy?

416: Sorry, it's not that I don't trust you, I simply don't want...

416: ...Nevermind. I'll focus on the mission at hand.

416: Time is running out, here's our objective again: we must strengthen our defense line within the time limit to ensure our reinforcements' safe arrival at the base!

...416 is proactively sustaining the supply line, but the enemy assault is ramping up in intensity.

416: Gather around me, check your ammo, and prepare for the next wave!

AK-74U: 416, can you still hold this point?

AK-74U: Well, it's not like I can be of much help even if you can't.

416: Then why did you even ask?!

AK-74U: Seeing your sour face brings me joy.

416: Why is everyone I met at Griffin like this?!

AK-74U: Birds of a feather flock together, haha.

416: Laugh all you want, we're about to die here.

AK-74U: You don't know that for sure. Didn't the Commander already call for reinforcements?

416: You believe in the Commander?

AK-74U: I can't very well believe in YOU, can I?

416: Why do you always have to believe in something?

AK-74U: Was I supposed to believe in myself instead?

AK-74U: 416, do you even know what "self" is?

416: ...I don't think I even want to know.

AK-74U: Our computational algorithms are called "thinking", while the contradictions created during the process are known as "emotions".

AK-74U: But do we actually have sentience and a "self"?

416: What are you getting at? Pretending to be a philosopher with that grouchy face?

AK-74U: I'm just saying...that's the reason I find it impossible to believe in myself.

...Whirrrrrr—

416: That noise...

AK-74U: But I believe in those that believe in me.

...BOOM! BOOM BOOM!

416: Commander? Ja! Get down everyone, close-range fire support incoming!

AK-74U: Close-range fire support? What's that?

...BOOM! BOOM BOOM!

Another round of violent explosions.

Kalina: The Heavy Ordnance Corps are here!

Kalina: Kept you waiting, huh?

...BOOM! BOOM BOOM!

Vicious salvos pummeled the enemies on the field.

AK-74U: What kind of new toy...has the Commander come up with?

416: This doesn't look like something a PMC should have...

AK-74U: Well, so long as we can win.

AK-74U: Gosh, that was close. I thought they wouldn't make it in time...

416: Didn't you just say to believe in the Commander?

AK-74U: I was just trying to ease your mind. Look at you, getting all high-strung on the field.

416: I simply didn't want to waste the Commander's resources.

...Incoming transmission request.

Kalina: Is everything alright there?

Kalina: Sorry, we just received a message from another strongpoint, Python's team is under attack. Can you head over and lend her a hand?

416: Are those HOCs not enough?

Kalina: I'm afraid not. The enemies are relentless over there, and a Ringleader seems to be present.

AK-74U: Then let's go.

AK-74U: We won't ever get out if we don't tidy up the place.

...Ten minutes later, at Python team's strongpoint.

Python: 74U, took the scenic route, huh?

AK-74U: We just made it out ourselves, but don't worry, the Commander's got some new toys!

Mk 12: Who's that over there? Should I remember her?

416: 416, the Commander's temporary adjutant.

Mk 12: Adjutant? Looks like a rookie to me...

AK-74U: You'd better trust her, she's a veteran compared to people here.

A-91: A veteran? Then why haven't I seen her before?

416: That's because while you're busy getting drunk at the base, I've been working my butt off out there.

A-91: Hey, I never...

Python: That's enough, sisters; let's deal with this Ringleader first before we have a chat, shall we?

416: That one in the distance?

Python: You see her? She hasn't budged at all ever since she got there; it's almost like she's a puppet...

Python: But she's without a doubt the one in command of this attack.

416: No information about her at all?

416: (Somehow...that face...)

Python: We don't even know if "it" can even speak.

416: The Commander's online again, I'll make contact.

416: You're Python, right? Please reassemble your echelon.

Python: Ha, you've got bravado, rookie.

Python: But I like that.

AK-74U: You've got eyes on you, 416.

416: ...Like I care.

416: As you can see, Commander, the enemies are continuing their attack on the outpost.

416: They have mobilized a lot more units this time, and the Ringleader is probably the biggest threat.

416: We'll need your HOCs, is that alright?

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

416: Very well, but keep an eye on supply consumption, our resources are very scarce.
If choice 2 was picked

AK-74U: Da, just like last time! Hurry up!
If choice 2 was picked

416: 74U, show the Commander more respect.
If choice 3 was picked

416: ...You'll soon realize I am irreplaceable.

416: Commander, I don't know how you got your hands on these HOCs.

416: But they're going to be invaluable for the battles ahead.

416: Make good use of them and annihilate the enemies in the outpost.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Battle concludes. The enemy assault on the outpost is successfully repelled.

...Under the covering fire from the HOCs, the outpost soon settles down again. The Griffin T-Dolls begin inspecting the damage through the pervasive smoke and dust.

Mk 12: I didn't think we'd actually survive.

Mk 12: We were just taking a one-sided beating, it feels so surreal now.

A-91: The stuff that the Commander brought along is pretty powerful.

Python: 416, thanks to you, our coordination with the Commander was seamless.

416: Don't mention it. Rather, I wouldn't live up to the position of adjutant if I hadn't done that.

AK-74U: We can relax for now with them protecting the base.

AK-74U: So what do we do now? Can we get on with rescuing the ones at the other strongpoints?

416: Feeling restless again?

AK-74U: My friends are still waiting for help. Although... it might be too late now.

Kalina: Don't worry. According to our sources, the enemy blockade beyond the perimeter shows no sign of waning, which means they're still alive for the time being.

Python: Miss Kalin, is the extraction point completely secured?

Kalina: Yep, thanks for repelling the enemies! While their attention was diverted, a lot of our T-Dolls have been repaired. They're now standing by in multiple defensive positions.

Kalina: Moreover, the first transport squadron has arrived!

416: The withdraw is finally underway?

Kalina: That's right, but right now the priority is to evacuate the wounded and non-combat personnel. You may have to stay behind for now and fight.

AK-74U: (Sighs) I wouldn't leave even if I could. 9A-91 is still waiting for me.

AK-74U: But now that reinforcements are here, we can go all out, right?

Kalina: Miss 416, your squad is a special case and has an injured member. Would you like to evacuate first?

416: I'm staying.

Kalina: Pardon?

416: You don't have to consider us for the evacuation, we have our own arrangements. Besides, saving more T-Dolls is also more guarantee for our safety.

416: Instead of trusting this bunch of idiots on the base...I'd rather put my experience to good use.

A-91: Hey, we heard that.

Mk 12: That was mean, but then again you're the adjutant, say what you want!

Kalina: Thank you, 416. You've been immensely helpful.

416: More like, how did you even manage before this...?

Kalina: The Commander's work will be over soon, you'll only have five more minutes to catch your breath, make the most of it.

Python: Miss Kalin, may I join the fireteam?

Kalina: Huh? Are you going, too?

Python: Since the base is safe for the time being, I'd rather be where I'm needed.

Python: After all, the T-Dolls out there are in grave danger, every bit of help increases our chance of victory.

Mk 12: I'm going as well! I won't let a rookie look down on me!

AK-74U: Uh, I told you she's not a rookie. You, on the other hand, are fresh out of IOP's factory, aren't you...?

A-91: Count me in, too. I really want to see for myself what you're made of.

Kalina: 416, are you okay with leading these T-Dolls?

416: A bunch of headstrong simpletons...

416: I have no objection as long as they follow my orders.

AK-74U: Haha... In any case, we're the only ones here to help.

AK-74U: Welcome to Griffin's Expendables, 416!

416: ...What kind of dumb name is that?

416: It's even lamer than "404"...

...Strongpoint No.2 at Griffin's temporary extraction point.

416: Commander, we've arrived in the vicinity of Strongpoint No.2. Allow me to report on the situation.

416: Strongpoint No.2 is currently under concentrated shelling of enemy artillery. The structures that the enemies air-dropped pose a serious threat to our effort.

416: We must prioritize destroying these structures before we can launch the rescue mission.

416: But even after we commence the operation, every target location will still be under fire, making it difficult for us to save all trapped echelons in there.

416: Commander, we are severely understaffed; frankly, I do not recommend aiming to rescue everybody.

416: However, considering the following battles, we do need to save all our allies in this strongpoint.

416: Focusing too much on destroying our enemies will only be a waste of precious time, so I'll need you to lead your echelons to tear open the enemy blockade, then my team will rush in to get our allies out.

...

Python: Got everything across to the Commander?

416: Ja, the Commander will create an opportunity for us to push in and get our friends out.

416: Do you know who the leader in this strongpoint is?

Python: No idea, I didn't have time to sync my data. Do you know anything, Mk 12?

Mk 12: I was busy defending the base, how would I have time to find out?!

Mk 12: How about A-91? ...Nevermind, she's drinking.

416: We're about to charge into enemy fire, your friend's life is hanging by a thread, and you don't even know who she is? How could you be so unprepared?

Python: I admit we are not experienced enough.

416: Then consider everything extra carefully, or you'll die from your own stupidity instead of enemy artillery.

Mk 12: Hey, you yourself haven't synced your data either!

416: I just got here. I didn't have time to obtain all relevant information.

A-91: Ha...so you're as unprepared as us.

416: ...Listen, I'm not saying all this to lay the blame on you, but any reckless decision is fatal on the battlefield.

416: We only have a single objective - rescue as many allies as we can and get back alive!

AK-74U: 416, I finished scouting around the strongpoint—

AK-74U: What's wrong?

416: I've had enough! These T-Dolls are too damn inefficient!

AK-74U: Chill, most of Griffin's elite combat forces were expended in the previous battles. It's already quite a stretch pulling T-dolls from logistics teams.

416: Tsk...

416: Then do you know who the leader in this outpost is?

AK-74U: She's the reason I came on this mission...

AK-74U: It's 9A-91. Haven't I already told you?

416: 9A-91 is the leader here... You didn't find out about that from a sync, did you?

AK-74U: I know the answer to your question. Isn't that all that matters?

416: (Studies the screen) ...Then she's our first rescue target.

416: Listen up. The Commander will focus everything on dealing with the blockade. Since I'm not equipped with a command module, you'll just have to wait for my verbal signal.

416: I need you to execute my orders immediately without any hesitation or doubt, affirmative?!

416: Now check your gear and await your orders!

...Meanwhile, inside Strongpoint No.2.

9A-91: Is the shelling...still going? I can't hear anything else.

...9A-91 puts down her pen.

9A-91: Guess I'll just leave it at there, and put my diary away.

...9A-91 looks around the room and hides it beneath an ammo box.

9A-91: I suppose...the Commander won't be coming.

9A-91: AK-74U and Val...

9A-91: This is it. Hopefully when I wake up again, my diary will still be intact.

9A-91: I hope I'll remember you, next time...

...The Commander successfully creates an opening in the enemy blockade.

416: Now! Everyone make a run for Strongpoint No.2! Hurry!

Python: You heard that? Let's go!

A-91: Hold on, we are still being bombarded!

416: It won't ever stop! Now follow me! Hurry!

...416 yells as she charges toward Strongpoint No.2.

Mk 12: Th...that's way too risky! We can't possibly—

...BOOM!

Mk 12: Whoa—!

Python: Mk 12!

416: Don't stop! Keep running!

A-91: How could we?!

AK-74U: 416, we've been—

AK-74U: Oh...she ran off...

AK-74U: (9A-91...)

AK-74U: ...Dammit! I'll go after her. Catch up when you can!

...416 dashes toward the entrance and kicks the door open.

416: 9A-91, take your people and come with me!

9A-91: You're...

416: A rescuer from Griffin. Stop wasting time, leave everything but your weapon and ammo. Schnell! Schnell!

9A-91: Right! Everyone get up and follow me out of here!

...416 leads the trapped echelon out of the strongpoint.

AK-74U: Pick up the pace; the enemies are about to rush in!

9A-91: 74U, you came!

AK-74U: Sorry for being late. Let's go!

9A-91: I'm glad... But why are there only two of you?

416: We have a fireteam... Scheiße! Where are they?

...Bang bang! The T-Dolls come under heavy gunfire.

9A-91: Ah!

AK-74U: 9A-91!

416: Everyone get down! Prepare to counterattack!

9A-91: I...I'm fine... I...

416: Stay quiet. I know!

AK-74U: 416, 9 o'clock!

416: Scheiße! With just the few of us—

...Bang bang!

...Bang bang bang!

...The hail of bullets stops, and a few familiar T-Dolls come running towards them.

Python: Sorry we're late. Just now...

416: Not now; let's go! Hurry up!

416: Mk 12 and A-91, keep 9A-91 safe; she's hurt!

Python: Let me do it. I'm stronger and my firepower isn't much help—

416: Listen to what I say and don't make me repeat myself! Quick! Suppressive fire! Center peel!

...Ten minutes later, Griffin's fireteam retreats from the blockade with the trapped T-Dolls. Peace in the security area has been restored.

Python: 416, we...

416: If you're going to apologize, I don't want to hear it.

Mk 12: But we should still explain ourselves...

416: It was all your fault.

A-91: But Mk 12 was knocked off her feet by an artillery shell. We couldn't possibly—

416: What if she had died right there?

A-91: Hey, how could you say that—

Mk 12: I'm sorry. It was my fault.

416: You didn't do anything wrong. No one can dodge all bullets and shrapnels on the field.

416: Don't forget we ARE on the battlefield - injury and death can happen to us any second.

416: But when our sole objective is to reach the outpost on the other side, the more time you waste on second-guessing an unavoidable outcome, the longer you put yourself and your companions in danger!

Python: We can't ignore the safety of our friends. We only joined Griffin not long ago and we only know each other.

416: I'm not telling you to ignore each other's safety, but I said you had to listen to me!

A-91: But what if you were wrong?

416: At least I was willing to take the chance! You won't gain anything if you never take risks!

416: Just now, any of us could've been hit by shrapnel or blasted to bits, but it was the only way to win!

Python: Say, that's your way. We're not used to it—

416: It's the professional way!

416: It's experience humans paid thousands of lives for - lives that they don't get to live again, and it was the only way for us to accomplish our mission!

...416 takes a deep breath.

416: No matter how good a T-Doll's specs are, if she's inexperienced and won't obey orders, she'll only be a consumable item on the battlefield.

416: Humans may think of us as expendables, but what about ourselves? Do YOU want to be something like that?

416: I'm not here to organize a picnic, guys. Do as I say and we'll all get home.

416: Next time, I expect no delays when I demand synchronized execution of an order, period.

...416 stalks off to AK-74U's side.

416: Is 9A-91 okay?

AK-74U: I wouldn't just sit here if she weren't.

416: So you saw the whole thing.

AK-74U: Da, you were really flaunting your authority as an adjutant, 416.

416: Griffin has a clear set of combat procedure. How did things still turn out this way?

AK-74U: We're just a PMC. A lot of our T-Dolls are only tasked with patrols and logistics missions and have never stepped foot on a battlefield. Not everyone is privileged enough to be installed with the best combat database.

416: Newbie or not, patrols or not, that's not a good excuse.

AK-74U: There's another reason - our neural clouds can be backed up. Memories mean more to us than our lives.

416: So that's why you value your friends more than yourselves.

AK-74U: At least they followed you in the end and didn't run off on their own, right?

416: We are Tactical Dolls, the Commander's pawns on the battlefield. It's what we're expected to do.

416: Regardless of what you usually value the most, nothing matters more than your orders now...

AK-74U: Da, da, life isn't worth crap... And who was it that just told the others not to treat themselves as consumables?

416: ...It's a different story when it comes to working with humans.

416: Now that I think about it...you seem to know a lot.

AK-74U: I joined Griffin a long time ago.

AK-74U: It's just that I kept having problems and undergoing modifications, until I finally ended up the way I am.

416: ...

AK-74U: We didn't WANT to be like this, 416.

AK-74U: The humans created us this way - even the traits that you find so irritating.

416: Being an adjutant is even more a pain in the butt than I thought.

416: After all, my previous teammates were all T-Dolls that could coordinate with each other perfectly. We're used to carrying out missions way more dangerous than this one.

416: But this time, all I need to do is to bring everyone home alive... I thought it was going to be easy.

AK-74U: Pffft...

AK-74U: Hahahahaha!

416: What's so funny?

AK-74U: You're always making such a surly face, but you're probably a really kind-hearted Doll.

416: I'm just doing my job.

AK-74U: And didn't you pick this job?

416: I did it to protect my friends.

AK-74U: You're a pro, I get it.

AK-74U: Still, things don't always go your way. Now that you're faced with difficult circumstances...are you gonna give up?

416: I have no choice but to rely on you. Isn't that right, Python?

...The others walk up to 416 one after the other.

Python: You may not want to hear it, but I still want to apologize again.

Python: ...From now on, we'll obey your orders without question.

Mk 12: We won't hesitate even in the most dangerous situation.

A-91: Next time, even if you order us to be meat shields, we'll do it.

416: That's not enough...

416: You must do it IMMEDIATELY.

416: It's almost time. Get ready to move to our next location.

Later...Strongpoint No.3 in Griffin's temporary base.

9A-91: Miss Thompson is in charge of defending Strongpoint 3.

AK-74U: If it's her, the enemies are probably having a hard time, right?

416: Whoever it is, facing this kind of bombardment can only mean certain death.

416: I can say for sure...the shelling is even more intense than before.

Python: With one fewer target to surround, they can concentrate their fire.

416: To be honest, this rescue mission will be way more difficult than the last.

416: I'm not sure our previous maneuver would work.

416: Even if it does...will the imminent sacrifices and expenses be worth it...?

A-91: Hey, we just pledged our absolute obedience to you; now you're getting cold feet?

Python: A-91!

416: I understand your concern, but I'm merely stating my objective analysis of the situation.

416: The Commander will make the ultimate decision.

Mk 12: Are we...giving up on Miss Thompson?

416: That's not what I meant. However...

416: If the Commander agrees with me, I hope you'll be prepared.

AK-74U: I understand. We're...pawns on the battlefield, right?

...

416: Commander, here's my sitrep on Strongpoint No.3.

416: This location is also within range of the enemy's artillery fixtures. If you insist on mounting the rescue, it may take a heavy toll on our manpower and resources.

416: Not to mention, I'm not certain we will succeed.

416: If it's only to defend the outpost, we can manage with this skeleton crew.

416: Perhaps withdrawing to the extraction point is the most logical course of action...

416: Though I know the decision to abort the rescue will torment you more than going ahead with it.

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

416: Is that so? Then you'd better make ample preparation.
If choice 2 was picked

416: If you're confident in your stockpile of resources, we COULD try our luck.
If choice 3 was picked

416: They're fully prepared for this, Commander, and so am I.

Mk 12: Make up your mind, Commander!

Mk 12: You can't be even more indecisive than a Doll, right?

416: Having a short temper as your factory setting can't exactly be called "being decisive".

A-91: Thompson is still waiting for rescue!

A-91: If we don't start moving now, enemy fire will soon come raining down on us too!

416: Commander, you can make your final decision depending on the actual circumstances in the coming battle.

416: On another note, we've noticed that some abandoned troops from the Military are standing guard along our route. It will be difficult to take them head-on, but if we seize the comms station nearby, we can disable the military troops. It's up to you, Commander.

416: Time is running out, we have to start the operation soon!

...Meanwhile, inside Strongpoint No.3.

Thompson: Guys.

Thompson: This is our last batch of ammo, sent to us by a logistics team during the brief window when the attack eased off. It was delivered by drone, so it's not much. Sorry.

...Thompson stands before her subordinates and drops a few ammo boxes on the table.

Thompson: Today could be the last day we serve together.

Thompson: If you've had any beef with me, I apologize.

Thompson: We are coming up against a completely unknown but very well-armed enemy - we don't stand much of a chance at all.

Thompson: The Commander might come to our rescue, but even in the best-case scenario, I can't promise we'll all get to witness that moment.

Thompson: What I can promise...is that I will never abandon you.

Thompson: What I can also promise...is that I will fight to my last breath.

Thompson: If anyone makes it out alive, please remember me.

...The rescue mission comes to an end. The group is making its way back to the base.

Mk 12: Are you okay, 416?

AK-74U: You look even moodier than me.

416: I...did something terrible.

Mk 12: It was the Commander's decision. Besides...I think it's the most suitable decision based on the circumstances.

416: I'm not so sure... If I hadn't made the suggestion...

AK-74U: It would be neglect of duty on your part, Miss Adjutant.

Mk 12: It's your job to provide objective insights, no matter how unpleasant they may be.

416: You don't seem too bothered.

Mk 12: This is the battlefield; we're all prepared for the worst.

Mk 12: Of course, I'm still very grateful that you saved me and kept my "ambition" alive.

416: What's your "ambition"?

Mk 12: Depends. It's different every time.

416: Every time?

Mk 12: Every time...I wake up...

Mk 12: I adopt a new lifestyle based on my past memories. Do you understand?

416: What an extravagant way of life, it's beyond my comprehension.

Mk 12: Is that so...? But you will understand eventually.

Mk 12: I'll scout ahead.

... Mk 12 walks off.

AK-74U: 416...

416: Are you trying to cheer me up as well?

AK-74U: I don't think you're in the mood.

AK-74U: But you've won everyone's recognition, haven't you?

416: I'm not the kind of Doll who does things for recognition.

AK-74U: I find that hard to believe.

AK-74U: I think you actually CRAVE recognition, isn't that right?

416: I don't know you well enough to discuss such things with you.

AK-74U: Then why don't you join us?

416: ...What do you mean?

AK-74U: I told you; I know something about you.

416: ...You shouldn't.

416: You should also know that I am authorized to have all of your neural clouds shut down permanently anytime.

AK-74U: Don't get all huffy with me, I'm not scared of what you can do.

AK-74U: Still, you don't plan on staying while you had the chance?

416: I have plans of my own.

416: This is just a temporary partnership. You'd better not get too close to me.

AK-74U: Say, you do have a choice, don't you?

416: Stop it, you don't know me at all.

AK-74U: But I know you're not happy where you are.

AK-74U: You want out, right?

...!

...416 grabs AK-74U by the throat.

AK-74U: ...!

416: You have no idea what I've gone through.

AK-74U: ...

AK-74U: 4...16...

AK-74U: I understand...this "escape" that you've gone through...

416: ...!

Python: Enough, 416.

416: ...Just playing around.

...416 releases her grip.

Python: This isn't the time to joke around. Did you hear the Commander's hail?

...Beep, 416 receives the transmission.

416: ...Right, copy that.

416: We'll be on our way.

AK-74U: A new mission?

416: The enemies have shown up as expected, Strongpoint No.76.

AK-74U: No.76? But that place isn't manned at all?

416: What...?

AK-74U: We're understaffed so a lot of our strongpoints are empty. What's the point in occupying such a place?

A-91: Maybe they're just doing it for fun.

416: Don't open your mouth until you put down your bottle.

A-91: You're in a bad mood; I understand.

416: We need to chase them off. The Commander said that strongpoint is too close to the extraction point. It's not good if it falls into enemy hands.

Mk 12: 416, we've discovered a few T-Doll signals ahead, we need you to go and confirm them.

416: Are they enemies?

Mk 12: Not entirely... Part of the signal is Sangvis, but most of it is Griffin.

416: What's that supposed to mean?

Mk 12: Python says you'll know how to deal with it.

416: Me...?

Python: Why are you so surprised?

Python: This is the reason why I ran all the way from the front to the back, looking for you.

416: Other than pulling the trigger, I don't know what else to do with a Sangvis.

Python: You'll know when you see.

Python: You're both "special" T-Dolls. I think you two probably know each other.

...Two minutes later.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah! RO, we're here! We're here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Look! It's the safe zone! We're safe!

RO635: What happened at HQ?!

RO635: SOP-II! If you don't tell me, don't even think about stepping foot into the security zone!

M4 SOPMOD II: Arghhhh! My right leg is out of control!!

416: Shut it.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...?!

RO635: You...you're...

416: What are you dawdling for? Regroup already!

M4 SOPMOD II: This T-Doll... Who is she again? She looks kinda familiar...?

416: You find too many people familiar, hurry up and get over here.

416: The enemy is about to launch their next attack. We must get everyone out of here before that.

Cx4 Storm: Enemy? The Military already got this far?

416: It's a new faction.

Cx4 Storm: A new faction?

Cx4 Storm: Not the Military?

Cx4 Storm: Not Sangvis Ferri either?

Cx4 Storm: Then who are they?

416: No idea.

416: All we know is that they want to kill us deader than dead.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh...is that so?

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, I don't mind as long as they're something I can kill.

416: That's the problem.

416: Those things...that want to kill us...

416: They're...unkillable.

...

416: At least they were a few hours ago. Now it's sorted.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

416: Let's go.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wait, was that a joke? Did I miss the punch line or something?

416: I said, let's GO!

...

416: Commander, we're heading towards Strongpoint No.76 to repel the white enemies' attack.

416: By the way, we happened to have picked up...

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander! Commander! Commander!

...Click!

...416 forcibly switches off SOP-II's comms channel.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey! That was really mean, 416!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO couldn't even say a word!

RO635: L-leave it, just let the Commander think I died...

416: We picked up SOP-II and RO from the AR Team along the way; Storm and her echelon are also with them.

416: They look a bit...different, but at least they can still move about.

RO635: I can't move about! I'm not free at all!

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Yes, Commander! I've been through a lot, but I'm finally back!
If choice 2 was picked

RO635: I...I...I'm on SOP-II's shoulder. Th-this is just a temporary arrangement! I was forced into it!
If choice 3 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah! I also knew I'd see you again, Commander!
If choice 3 was picked

RO635: Well...at least we're still alive. I'm glad you're okay, Commander.

416: Save the chit-chat for later. We're about to arrive at Strongpoint No.76.

416: Commander, since we didn't rescue all the trapped echelons, we'll have a tough battle ahead of us.

416: Please prepare for all possibilities and do your best in completing this objective.

...Strongpoint No.3. The Commander finally managed to create an opening in the enemy blockade.

416: Now, move! Watch out and dodge the artillery fire!

...BOOM!

...A shell exploded right next to 416.

AK-74U: 416!

416: Don't mind me! Carry out my order! Quick!

416: 74U, what are you doing?!

...AK-74U grabs 416 and drags her behind cover.

AK-74U: I decide how to execute your order.

AK-74U: Stay alive. Don't die.

...AK-74U catches up with Python and the others, and makes for the strongpoint.

416: ...What a bunch of garbage.

416: No matter how I try to train them, I just can't turn them into 404...

416: I suppose that's the difference in our levels of professionalism...

416: Or perhaps...I should change a little...?

Mk 12: Stop! Hold your fire! It's Griffin!

Thompson: Ohhhh, it's you! I thought—

A-91: Don't you dare kick the bucket just like that, you still owe me a drink!

Thompson: I'm glad you remember!

Thompson: Hurry! Everyone out of the building! Follow Python and the others! Go!

416: After all, this group of garbage...

416: ...managed to do what I couldn't...

...20 minutes later, at a temporary Griffin camp.

Thompson: Hey, so you're 416, eh?

416: Fräulein Thompson, nice to meet you.

Thompson: Is this the first time we've met?

416: Of course?

Thompson: Indeed, I haven't heard of you before, but I've heard all about everything you did today. You're Griffin's hero.

416: A hero who spent the entire rescue mission skulking behind cover?

Thompson: You whipped these rookies fresh out of IOP's factory into such good shape. That's a lot more impressive than crashing through enemy ranks all by yourself.

416: What did they do to deserve such generous praise from an ace like you?

Thompson: They braved the enemy's artillery fire with no means of communication and came charging into the strongpoint to get us out of danger.

416: That's the least they could do, it was our objective, after all.

Thompson: But they were disciplined and orderly throughout the process - not a single mistake.

Thompson: If it weren't for your wealth of experience, 416, it would've been impossible to improve their coordination so much in just a few hours.

416: I am indeed no stranger to the battlefield, but this isn't the time for telling stories.

416: Or...are you that desperate to learn about me?

Thompson: Leave it for now, but I like that look in your eyes; I could use a partner like you in my next interrogation assignment.

Thompson: Still, I'm just trying to express my gratitude. Griffin has nurtured a lot of reliable comrades-in-arms while I wasn't looking.

Thompson: It's an honor to meet you. I hope we'll have more opportunities to work together in the future.

416: I can't say for sure. It's entirely up to the organization I belong to. Maybe it'll never happen again.

Thompson: Then I'll treasure it this time.

...Thompson waved and walks off.

AK-74U: You seem to be alive.

416: The "seem to" is superfluous, and "alive" is overrated.

AK-74U: Looks like we didn't disappoint you.

416: I didn't anticipate this outcome. You did well enough - without me.

AK-74U: That's what it truly means to be a Tactical Doll, right?

AK-74U: We aren't just pawns; we make our own judgments, and trusting you is one of them.

416: What was that judgment based on?

AK-74U: You saved 9A-91, you saved my friends. I know you'll save even more.

416: Friends are important, but seeing that we're on the battlefield, we must be prepared to lose everything.

AK-74U: Do you have friends, 416?

416: ...

416: I'm not sure if "they" count.

AK-74U: When you get caught in a blast, will they run over to help you?

416: No, they know I'll think of a way to get myself out of trouble.

AK-74U: Having friends could be a way.

416: It's not one I'm particularly comfortable with, I do well enough on my own.

416: It's time. Let's move.

...416 stood up and prepares to leave.

AK-74U: Won't you even consider staying?

416: ...?

AK-74U: If you stay at Griffin, you can try different ways.

AK-74U: Not just having friends, but other possibilities as well. We know even you aren't omnipotent.

416: I won't have the chance.

416: Maybe next time.

Later...at Strongpoint No.4 in Griffin's temporary base.

416: 74U, give me your take on the situation.

AK-74U: From an optimistic point of view, it's FUBAR.

AK-74U: Not only is Strongpoint No.4 under intense bombardment, it's even surrounded by the enemy's heavy armored troops.

AK-74U: All the tactics I can come up with will blow up in our face.

416: What about the trapped T-Dolls?

Python: They're led by MP40, do you know her?

416: As I recall, she isn't an elite T-Doll, so why is she the leader of an outpost?

Mk 12: Strongpoint No.4 was abandoned. She led a logistics team to deliver ammo to Miss Thompson and ended up being trapped in there.

A-91: Simply put, it was an unfortunate accident.

Mk 12: Fortunate, you mean. They'd have been destroyed along the way otherwise.

Python: The building was under the HOCs' cover and the Fairies' protection, so it hasn't fallen yet.

Python: However, once the enemies gather for real, it'll crumble just like that.

Mk 12: Should we...rescue them?

A-91: It's not exactly cost-effective, is it?

416: Since when did you become...like this?

Python: We're weighing our options objectively - whether the returns are worth the risk.

416: You learn fast and you learn well.

AK-74U: Not to mention, judging by MP40's personality, she won't turn into a nasty ghost and bother us even if we give up on her.

416: That was rude.

AK-74U: Just stating facts.

416: So you'd crash someone's birthday party and tell them they're gonna die one day?

AK-74U: It's fine if this person can't beat me up.

AK-74U: MP40? I don't think she stands a chance against me.

416: So, do you all agree to abandon this last echelon?

AK-74U: (Snickers) ...

All: Certainly not!

416: ...I knew it.

416: Griffin is always...

416: ...full of idiots dragging me down.

416: Guess I'll just slow down a bit myself.

...Meanwhile, in Strongpoint No.4.

...MP40 snaps open her pocket watch. The second hand takes its last tick.

System Notice: ...Unable to upload neural cloud. Please retry.

MP40: Forget it. Just close the window.

...MP40 closes her pocket watch, untangles the chain, and puts it carefully into a box.

MP40: Even the most orderly formation will be crushed by artillery fire...

MP40: Guess I shouldn't get my hopes up...

...MP40 gets up on her feet.

MP40: We've done our best.

MP40: We helped Fräulein Thompson and Fräulein Kalina. There's nothing else we can do.

MP40: I want to live, but the enemy's artillery...will consume this place any minute.

MP40: I want you all to write everything down so that you won't forget what happened here and now.

MP40: I also want to say something inspiring so that we can face the final moment with courage.

MP40: But...what I want most is to cherish the time we have left.

MP40: This is the last day we'll be partners, let's cherish this moment.

MP40: I'm very happy to be part of Griffin...so...

MP40: Commander...please...

...

416: Commander, this is the last strongpoint.

416: You've seen what it's like over there. To be honest, I strongly advise against rescuing MP40.

416: Saving a logistics team is going to cost us dearly and put us in great jeopardy.

416: They can be helpful in our subsequent battles, but do consider the cost.

416: Still, the final decision is yours.

416: We're about to engage the enemy.

416: Forgo the rescue or take the risk - I'll trust you no matter your decision, Commander.

...Strongpoint No.4. The Commander's echelons finally broke through the blockade!

...However—

...BOOM! BOOM!

416: It's not working! The enemy artillery is still too heavy!

416: Stay in cover!

...Enemy bombardment is severely hindering the fireteam's progress.

AK-74U: We can't hide here forever, 416!

AK-74U: Artillery fire will destroy the building any minute!

416: It's suicide if we go out now!

AK-74U: We're almost there! How can we give up now?!

AK-74U: Then the Commander's effort will be for nothing!

416: Dying here will truly render it all for naught!

AK-74U: We won't gain anything if we never take risks, that's what you said!

416: It's also something I absolutely hate hearing...

416: I...don't actually like taking risks to begin with.

416: (Perhaps 404 doesn't actually suit me.)

416: (Perhaps...I should find a better place to belong to.)

A-91: Hey, are you giving up just like that? In a place like this?

416: ...What?

A-91: Then stand aside. It's time for us rookies to steal the spotlight.

Mk 12: We should be able to cover this distance.

Python: Then let's activate our secret weapon!

...Whirrr.

416: That's...?!

Taunt Fairy: Hey, why are you staring at me like that?

Taunt Fairy: If you think I'm a mirror, allow me to remind you that this pretty face doesn't suit you at all!

416: What...are you guys up to?!

Mk 12: Go and deliver the information!

A-91: Watch out for artillery fire! Wanna steel yourself with a swig of vodka?

AK-74U: Are you sure...this is gonna work?

Python: All that needs to be done is to send the coordinates over, right?

Python: Then why must we go ourselves?

416: But how will a Fairy drone give them cover as they make their way out?

A-91: They're one of the oldest logistics teams at Griffin. No one knows the emergency routes better than them.

Mk 12: The Fairy will lead them on the relatively safest route, then we'll give them cover with our smoke grenades!

Mk 12: We'll just have to concentrate on suppressing enemy fire!

AK-74U: Provided that...the Fairy can make it there safely.

AK-74U: Oh right, did you tell her how to bypass the security lock on the door?

Mk 12: Now that you mention it...

Taunt Fairy: Ahhhhhh! I'm gonna get bombed!

Python: Watch out!

...BOOM!

...The blast sends the Taunt Fairy crashing into the door of the outpost.

MP40: Huh?

MP40: Was that...a knock? Hmm?

MP40: Is someone...knocking on the outside?

Taunt Fairy: Idiot! Idiot! Do you not even know how to open a door? Hurry up!

MP40: Our drone?! Why are you—

Taunt Fairy: Idiot! Griffin is here to rescue you!

Taunt Fairy: You bunch of idiots! I fly very fast, so make sure you don't fall behind!

MP40: Huh? Oh, ja! Everyone with me!

AK-74U: They got out!

AK-74U: Throw all the smoke grenades you have!

416: Suppressing fire!

Mk 12: They've run into the smoke screen! But the enemies are now firing at the obscured area!

416: Tsk... It's up to their luck if they can make it out alive...!

...Five minutes later.

AK-74U: Huh...that's unexpected...

A-91: They all got out...

Mk 12: Maybe they're used to running logistics...so they run pretty fast...?

MP40: Tactical Doll MP40 from Griffin, reporting back for duty!

416: Got it. Take a good rest first and prepare for more battles ahea...

416: ...Whoa!

...Puff!

...MP40 gives 416 a bear hug.

MP40: Danke. Thank you so much for saving us!

416: It's all thanks to the Commander and everyone here.

416: You survived. That was simply our mission.

MP40: I thought...we were going to be left behind! I-I shouldn't have assumed that!

416: Don't get too worked up. We did consider that option.

MP40: Ja...it's only natural...

MP40: All the more reason to thank you!

416: ...I accept your gratitude.

416: Rest up. We have a tough fight ahead of us and we'll need you to work your share.

...416 excuses herself from MP40 and rejoins the fireteam.

Python: Oh look, our brave hero returnth.

AK-74U: You did the impossible and saved so many trapped T-Dolls. Got anything boastful to say?

416: Don't let down your guard. The enemy won't give up just like that.

416: They'll definitely focus all their firepower and deal a massive blow to our base.

416: It's hard to tell whether we'll live through this until then.

Mk 12: Don't worry, we'll listen to you.

416: What if I'm wrong?

A-91: It's all on you then, but no pressure.

416: At least hold back on your alcohol consumption so that you'll keep a clear head for the battles ahead.

416: I don't know what effects alcohol has on your neural cloud, but drinking less is probably better for the operation.

A-91: That's why I drink. The more I drink, the clearer my head.

416: I don't get it...

Python: It's our factory presets, 416. In other words, it's our fate.

416: I don't understand the meaning of such things.

Mk 12: Neither do we. But it's some thing we take joy in, just like fighting battles.

416: ...In a certain sense, you have more courage than me.

AK-74U: It's a bit late to start praising us, don't you think?

416: Just stating facts. I don't mean to praise you.

Mk 12: But it does make me happy!

Python: Enjoy the present, 416.

Python: The present is especially precious because the future is full of danger.

416: ...Then three minutes.

...416's lips twist into a faint smile.

416: Now, would you mind if I play some music?

Shortly later... All T-Dolls that took part in the rescue missions are retreating back to the base.

416: ...Right, copy that.

416: We'll be on our way.

AK-74U: A new mission?

416: The enemies have shown up as expected. Strongpoint No.76.

AK-74U: No.76? But that place isn't manned at all?

416: What...?

AK-74U: We're understaffed so a lot of our strongpoints are empty. What's the point in occupying such a place?

A-91: Could it be for collecting data on us?

A-91: They could be analyzing our defense mechanisms to improve their tactics in preparation for the final offensive.

416: That makes sense. Is it because of the alcohol?

A-91: I killed seven bottles. I'm a proper brainiac now.

416: We need to chase them off. The Commander said that strongpoint is too close to the extraction point. It's not good if it falls into enemy hands.

Mk 12: 416, we've discovered a few T-Doll signals ahead, we need you to go and confirm them.

416: Are they enemies?

Mk 12: Not entirely... Part of the signal is Sangvis, but most of it is Griffin.

416: What's that supposed to mean?

Mk 12: Python says you'll know how to deal with it.

416: Me...?

Python: Why are you so surprised?

Python: This is the reason why I ran all the way from the front to the back, looking for you.

416: Other than pulling the trigger, I don't know what else to do with a Sangvis.

Python: You'll know when you see.

Python: You're both "special" T-Dolls. I think you two probably know each other.

...Two minutes later.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah! RO, we're here! We're here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Look! It's the safe zone! We're safe!

RO635: What happened at HQ?!

RO635: SOP-II! If you don't tell me, don't even think about stepping foot into the security zone!

M4 SOPMOD II: Arghhhh! My right leg is out of control!!

416: Shut it.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...?!

RO635: You...you're...

416: What are you dawdling for? Regroup already!

M4 SOPMOD II: This T-Doll... Who is she again? She looks kinda familiar...?

416: You find too many people familiar, hurry up and get over here.

416: The enemy is about to launch their next attack. We must get everyone out of here before that.

Cx4 Storm: Enemy? The Military already got this far?

416: It's a new faction.

Cx4 Storm: A new faction?

Cx4 Storm: Not the Military?

Cx4 Storm: Not Sangvis Ferri either?

Cx4 Storm: Then who are they?

416: No idea.

416: All we know is that they want to kill us deader than dead.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh...is that so?

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, I don't mind as long as they're something I can kill.

416: That's the problem.

416: Those things...that want to kill us...

416: They're...unkillable.

...

416: At least they were a few hours ago. Now it's sorted.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

416: Let's go.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wait, was that a joke? Did I miss the punch line or something?

416: I said, let's GO!

...

416: Commander, we're heading towards Strongpoint No.76 to repel the white enemies' attack.

416: By the way, we happened to have picked up...

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander! Commander! Commander!

...Click!

...416 forcibly switches off SOP-II's comms channel.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey! That was really mean, 416!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO couldn't even say a word!

RO635: L-leave it, just let the Commander think I died...

416: We picked up SOP-II and RO from the AR Team along the way; Storm and her echelon are also with them.

416: They look a bit...different, but at least they can still move about.

RO635: I can't move about! I'm not free at all!

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Yes, Commander! I've been through a lot, but I'm finally back!
If choice 2 was picked

RO635: I...I...I'm on SOP-II's shoulder. Th-this is just a temporary arrangement! I was forced into it!
If choice 3 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah! I also knew I'd see you again, Commander!
If choice 3 was picked

RO635: Well...at least we're still alive. I'm glad you're okay, Commander.

416: Save the chit-chat for later. We're about to arrive at Strongpoint No.76.

416: Commander, we've managed to rescue all the echelons that were pinned down, and they'll be available for the upcoming operation.

416: We have a good chance at victory now, but do pay attention to our resource expenditure and complete our tactical objective cautiously.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Battle concluded.

Mk 12: What a boring fight.

AK-74U: That's probably because we have plenty of manpower to spare.

416: It was just a probing attack, they won't call it a quit at that.

A-91: They're learning everything they can about us, then they'll kill us all in one go.

A-91: I'm guessing the final attack won't be far off.

M4 SOPMOD II: The enemy's gonna launch their final offensive soon; we should head back! Let's go, let's go!

RO635: Whoa! Slow down, SOP-II!

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II! Be careful with RO; she's about to fall off!

AK-74U: Have you given what I said some proper thought, 416?

416: Haven't got the time. Maybe later...

...Whirrrr—!

...An ear-splitting klaxon goes off on everyone's comms.

Kalin: Attention, everyone! The unknown enemies are launching a massive attack on the base!

Kalin: All hands, follow the Commander's instructions and go to your battle stations!

416: So soon?! Those Dolls dressed in black—

416: Still...is this their final offensive...

416: After that, I'll have to be on my way...

M4 SOPMOD II: What are you doing, 416? Hurry!

416: Or do I actually have a choice...?

...Perimeter of Griffin's extraction point.

M4 SOPMOD II: 416! 416!

416: Ugh...

M4 SOPMOD II: Thank goodness you're alive!

M4 SOPMOD II: Get up! We have to retreat!

Cx4 Storm: The enemies are too powerful! These Dolls dressed in black aren't any weaker than military units! Where the hell did they come from?!

Mk 12: I should've put more effort in taking notes on their specs!

RO635: SOP-II, don't rush too far ahead! I'll get hit by stray bullets!

416: What a complete mess...

416: Don't panic! Fall back to the defense line!

...Two minutes later.

416: Commander, we're under the enemy's full-scale attack. They're coming at us more fiercely than they've ever done!

416: We're doing everything we can to fight back, but the situation is not looking good at all.

416: I must say...the odds are not in our favor...

M4 SOPMOD II: But we won't give up!

M4 SOPMOD II: I...will never lose to some unidentified mutts!

416: SOP-II...

RO635: Don't admit defeat before the battle is lost, 416!

AK-74U: I must defend this line to my dying breath for 9A-91 and Val!

Cx4 Storm: Everyone at Griffin have only us to count on!

Mk 12: That's right! This is my current "ambition"!

416: ...What a bunch of idiots.

416: Still...looks like I've got no choice.

416: Commander, are you ready?

416: No matter how difficult the fight, for the sake of our companions behind us, we must win!
Part 2

...End of operation.

Black-clad Doll: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: What a weirdo, do you not even know how to cry in pain? Are you mute?

Black-clad Doll: ...

The Doll clad in black remains utterly expressionless.

M4 SOPMOD II: Nevermind, then let me see...what your body is made out of.

RO635: Don't go too far, SOP-II.

RO635: We should preserve the body to collect more data.

M4 SOPMOD II: It's fine as long as I keep her alive, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: It won't hurt if she's missing an eye or...

Black-clad Doll: You...

Black-clad Doll: ...will not get anything...

Black-clad Doll: ...Activate self-destruct sequence.

RO635: SOP-II! Chop off her hand!

...BOOM!

M4 SOPMOD II: Arghhhhhh!

M4 SOPMOD II: Dammit! I was too late!

M4 SOPMOD II: Self-destruct sequence, my butt! It was just a bomb!

RO635: SOP-II...

RO635: Did you take a good look at the Doll...?

M4 SOPMOD II: No. What about her?

RO635: She...

RO635: ...didn't seem to be a Doll...

M4 SOPMOD II: What are you talking about?! Why would they send a human instead of a doll?

RO635: But when she was hit, the red fluid that started leaking...looked more like...

M4 SOPMOD II: It could just be something similar? Hardly a big deal.

416: How are things on your end, SOP-II? Have you captured the Doll?

M4 SOPMOD II: She blew herself up. You?

416: Same thing. Let's go back first. It's over.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Don't the enemies have reinforcements?

416: We realized that once the black-clad Dolls disappear, the remaining enemies won't carry on.

RO635: A command network like that could be a clue.

RO635: (But...what kind of Doll could they be...?)

416: Let's go. Another transport squadron has arrived. It's time to withdraw.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? There's no one left on the battlefield?! Since when?!

RO635: It's all your fault for picking up trash all the time, SOP-II!

RO635: Hurry up! We won't get any decent seats if we waste any more time!

M4 SOPMOD II: Damn! Alright, 416! Wait for meeeeee!

416: ...

416: I never said I was going with you.

...

416: That's right...

416: I never said that...

...Outside Griffin's extraction point.

Thompson: Everyone at Griffin!

Thompson: This is our last stand.

Thompson: Thanks to 416, we all made our way safely back here.

Thompson: Our defense line remains strong and robust; we're sufficiently armed; we all have the courage to fight for our survival.

Thompson: The enemy units are immensely powerful - more powerful than the usual PMC.

Thompson: They attack us relentlessly, fearlessly.

Thompson: But we have the Commander, flexible tactics, and a wealth of experience. We also have each other, but most importantly, we know why we're here.

Thompson: True, they don't fear death, but only we know what it truly means to live.

Thompson: Say something, too, 416.

416: ...

416: ...We made it.

416: But it wasn't thanks to me, I didn't think I could save you all.

416: It was the Commander who believed in you. The Commander said we must save all our T-Dolls, and so I did.

416: I don't have the right to stand amongst you, but if it's an order, I'll carry it out.

416: Because only the Commander can lead us to victory, and only in victory do I see the future...

416: (The future... I wonder where it will lead me...)

MP40: I believe that as long as the Commander is here, as long as we're all together, we can bear witness to a miracle, a miracle like...all of us standing side by side, right here!

9A-91: This time, I want to survive with all my friends.

Thompson: ...416.

Thompson: You'll find your answers soon.

Thompson: For the sake of our future, follow the Commander to victory!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hahaha! More new parts for me!

RO635: I can only witness this occasion in my current form...but I'll remind you all not to give up - loudly!

Cx4 Storm: We finally made it back. We can't just fall here!

AK-74U: 9A-91 and Val are still waiting for me. If I don't grab the MVP title, I'll have to carry everyone's bags again the next time we go shopping.

Mk 12: C'mon! It's another step closer to achieving my ambition!

A-91: I must survive for the sake of my next bottle of vodka.

Python: Now then, prepare for battle!

...Five minutes later. The Commander starts laying down the defense line.

AK-74U: You haven't decided yet, have you?

416: I will get what I want my own way.

416: It may not be a simple question of "should I stay or should I go".

AK-74U: Ha...

AK-74U: Well, in any case, I'm glad to have met you.

...74U pats 416 on the shoulder.

AK-74U: You won't die, right?

416: (Smiles) Not if the Commander wants me alive.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...End of operation.

Black-clad Doll: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: What a weirdo, do you not even know how to cry in pain? Are you mute?

Black-clad Doll: ...

The Doll clad in black remains utterly expressionless.

M4 SOPMOD II: Nevermind, then let me see...what your body is made out of.

RO635: Don't go too far, SOP-II.

RO635: We should preserve the body to collect more data.

M4 SOPMOD II: It's fine as long as I keep her alive, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: It won't hurt if she's missing an eye or...

Black-clad Doll: You...

Black-clad Doll: ...will not get anything...

Black-clad Doll: ...Activate self-destruct sequence.

RO635: SOP-II! Chop off her hand!

...BOOM!

M4 SOPMOD II: Arghhhhhh!

M4 SOPMOD II: Dammit! I was too late!

M4 SOPMOD II: Self-destruct sequence, my butt! It was just a bomb!

RO635: SOP-II...

RO635: Did you take a good look at the Doll...?

M4 SOPMOD II: No. What about her?

M4 SOPMOD II: Damn! Alright, 416! Wait for meeeeee!

416: ...

416: I never said I was going with you.

...

416: That's right...

416: I never said that...

...Griffin's withdrawal is almost complete.

...The Griffin T-Dolls get in line to board the transports. They wave each other farewell, waiting to meet again at the new base.

AK-74U: Why are you still here, 416?

416: The Commander just issued another rescue mission in the current theater.

416: Anyone that wants to take part are free to stay behind.

AK-74U: I heard. That mission is a real dangerous one. Why are you going?

416: I didn't say I was. Some will go, some will stay.

416: I'm just taking in the view and...doing some thinking.

416: Are you going now?

AK-74U: I don't want to stay here a second longer. 9A-91 and Val can't agree more.

AK-74U: Oh right, 9A-91 said your friends are looking for you.

416: They're just my teammates. Our transport is probably here as well.

AK-74U: So you're going, after all? Or are you just hiding from them? Or...

416: I'll make that decision myself.

416: But I need to think about...

AK-74U: Don't take too long. This is the last transport squadron. Soon everyone will—

416: 74U...

416: I used to...be part of Griffin as well.

416: A proper elite T-Doll. I was actually the adjutant for a while.

AK-74U: Is that so...?

AK-74U: I have heard some rumors about you. Didn't know they're actually true.

416: Ja...then something happened...

416: I didn't have a choice, and I ended up...joining a renegade squad.

416: Dolls or humans, as long as I have my orders, I can harm them all.

AK-74U: ...

416: I dislike those orders, but...there's nothing I can do...

416: And...my teammates...

AK-74U: You like them, don't you?

416: Even though I can't really fathom what's so good about them.

AK-74U: At least they won't throw a fit if they can't get their hands on booze, right?

416: (Chuckles) Indeed. But they have even worse habits.

AK-74U: I have two very good friends. In my experience, we became friends not because they're anything special...

AK-74U: Sometimes, the only reason is because we're together. It's all a matter of coincidence.

416: Coincidentally...I met three bastards.

AK-74U: If you're still so uncertain, those three bastards must've been pretty nice to you.

416: Do you want me to stay or not?

...AK-74U smiles a little.

AK-74U: No matter what your final decision is, I lived through a mind-blowing battle. I'm honored to have fought by your side.

416: If you knew what I've done, you wouldn't feel that way.

AK-74U: Who knows, maybe I'd be even more honored?

AK-74U: See you around. Don't skulk alone for too long. Kalin will get worried.

416: I think you're more worried about her than me.

...416 gives her a casual wave and takes a look at her surroundings.

416: Now then... Time to get going...

416: Where...should I go...?

...In the end, they failed to slow down the enemies, the intruders broke through the defense line and Griffin echelons routed.

416: Commander! The defense line is down! At this rate, we won't be able to withdraw!

416: Should we abandon the base or force an extraction when the transport gets here—

Griffin T-Doll: Look! It's our transport!

416 looks up...

BOOM!

Before she could even raise her hopes, she sees...the transport taking a direct hit from enemy units that have stormed into the base and exploding mid-air.

The massive aircraft wreckage crashes into the earth like a roaring sun and engulfs the entire Griffin base in flames.

Hope dies...along with any signs of life...

...

...

Nyto: I do not understand, Commander, how you are still in the mood to tell jokes under such circumstances.

...Smack!

Nyto: Crude jokes won't fool us no matter how many times you try.

It used its leg this time - or rather, a weapon in the shape of a leg.

I'm starting to miss when she was using her arm. Of course, I didn't enjoy it in the slightest, but it was certainly a lot gentler than this.

My stomach heaves and I hurl up its contents. I can see what these cold-blooded puppets have been feeding me for the last two months...

I stare at the vomit and blood on the floor, but I've got to admit - I was asking for it. I should've come up with a better story.

Nyto: Now, amend your account.

Nyto: We know what happened to 416, but we need to find out where she has gone. Your answer must coincide with the subsequent events.

Look on the bright side...

At least I managed to buy a bit more time again, though I'm not sure how much my body can still take.

My head is spinning; I can feel my will crumbling, but I cannot give in. I must make my story convincing...

Or at the very least...a bit more credible.

...The rescue mission is terminated prematurely. All Griffin forces retreat back to the defense line.

...An hour later, the enemy launches attack on multiple targets at the Griffin base, resulting in severe losses.

416: I knew it was going to end like this...

416: Commander, I did suggest we be prudent with the rescue, but I don't think it's a good idea to abort the mission altogether!

416: The enemy is hitting harder and harder. Our forces are at a staggering disadvantage—

...BOOM!

416: ...!

416: Are we...too late...?

...BOOM! BOOM!

Howls of terror can be heard all over the base.

The enemy's final offensive has officially begun.

Griffin's remaining T-Dolls have no way to withstand the attack.

...Everything is over.

...

...

Nyto: I do not understand, Commander, how you are still in the mood to tell jokes under such circumstances.

...Smack!

Nyto: Crude jokes won't fool us no matter how many times you try.

My head is spinning; I can feel my will crumbling, but I cannot give in. I must make my story convincing...

Or at the very least...a bit more credible.

...In the end, 416 decided to leave Squad 404 and return to her old life in Griffin...

Even though the present Griffin is completely different than the one recorded in her neural cloud.

416: Where are we going?

AK-74U: Griffin's new headquarters. A base bigger and better than the old one.

AK-74U: I hear the construction was sponsored by the organization behind 16LAB. We'll get even better treatment from now on.

416: Those enemies will not let up. We won't have too much free time to enjoy them.

AK-74U: At least we got out of this predicament. We're leaving Sangvis Ferri, the Military, and this battlefield behind.

AK-74U: Once the Commander comes back, we can turn over a new leaf.

416: But where's the Commander?

AK-74U: Didn't you say there's a rescue mission? The Commander wants to rescue one last person.

416: ...I know who that is.

416: But it's got nothing to do with me now.

AK-74U: True, welcome to Griffin.

However, 416 believes that she will adapt to the new Griffin and the new future.

...What matters now is to bid her past farewell.

AK-74U: Oh, aren't those your teammates over there?

AK-74U: Are they looking for you?

416: UMP9...

416: And Gr G11...

416: Their transport is here to pick up UMP45. They won't look for too long.

AK-74U: I know you're sad, but we've already lifted off.

416: I don't regret my decision.

416: I fulfilled my end of the bargain. My departure is only a matter of time.

416: All is as agreed. They know that.

AK-74U: You still owe them a farewell.

416: ...If there are no goodbyes, they won't miss me.

416: ...If we don't miss each other, we'll know everyone is safe and sound.

...That's right, it's just a matter of time.

Now seems to be the best moment. And this is the best ending.

...

...

Nyto: I do not understand, Commander, how you are still in the mood to tell jokes under such circumstances.

...Smack!

Nyto: Crude jokes won't fool us no matter how many times you try.

My head is spinning; I can feel my will crumbling, but I cannot give in. I must make my story convincing...

Or at the very least...a bit more credible.

...416 returned to Squad 404. She knows that some things are beyond the control of mere promises.

This isn't the time to say goodbye. There is still much to be done.

Or rather...a lot of things still to be said.

416: How's 45?

UMP9: Stable enough for now; at least more stable than you.

416: What about me?

UMP9: Look at the face you're making.

416: Do I look unhappy?

416: Do you have any idea what I gave up today?

Gr G11: I don't want to know.

Gr G11: I'm just glad you came back alive.

UMP9: At least 45 will be pleased.

416: Her? Pleased?

416: She just can't be bothered to find a new recruit.

UMP9: And...what's wrong with that?

UMP9: It's hard to find a teammate like you...

416: 9...

416: I haven't changed my mind yet.

416: One day, I'll still go my own way.

UMP9: I know, but at least you're here now.

UMP9: I think that's the most reassuring thing to all of us.

416: I didn't come back to reassure you.

416: I just...

Gr G11: 416...

Gr G11: ...I'm sleepy.

...416 sighs.

416: Stupid dormouse. We'll see who's going to wake up first, you or 45.

416: Then I'll dunk the loser into a mud puddle.

Gr G11: You say that...

Gr G11: But in the end...you'll still gonna...fetch me back...

Gr G11: Zzz...zzzZZZZZZzzz...

UMP9: (Giggles) She already admitted defeat.

416: What an idiot.

416: ...Maybe I'm also an idiot.

UMP9: We're all idiots, I suppose.

416: No, you're not. You're a witch.

UMP9: But if we're all idiots...

UMP9: ...Isn't that what makes us a family?

416: That's just wishful thinking on your part, 9. You—

416: ...You're...crying?

UMP9: It's just that...we've been through so much...

UMP9: But right now...I feel so happy...

...416 remains silent.

She looks at the Griffin T-Dolls outside the window. They're bustling about in preparation of returning to the war zone on a rescue mission.

She knows who the target is, but she doesn't care.

All that matters to her is the short-lived peace in the present, a brief moment of happiness that they can savor.

Tomorrow, their story will continue.

...

...

Nyto: I do not understand, Commander, how you are still in the mood to tell jokes under such circumstances.

...Smack!

Nyto: Crude jokes won't fool us no matter how many times you try.

My head is spinning; I can feel my will crumbling, but I cannot give in. I must make my story convincing...

Or at the very least...a bit more credible.

...In the end, 416 comes before UMP9.

She has decided to go after what she wants.

416: 9, I'm taking part in Griffin's rescue mission.

UMP9: Are you sure you know what you're doing?

416: I'm doing what I want to do.

416: You know who they're trying to rescue.

UMP9: But...rescuing her isn't our job.

UMP9: At least she didn't give us this assignment.

416: Which is why I want to go. It's my own decision.

UMP9: 416...

UMP9: You seem to have changed...

416: I've had enough...of working to live up to others' expectations...

416: I'm going to stop chasing after someone else, be it you or Griffin.

UMP9: ...I understand.

UMP9: But that doesn't mean you have to rescue her, does it?

UMP9: Do you know how dangerous it is in there?

416: I won't be alone.

416: The Commander will oversee the operation, and the remaining members of the AR Team will accompany me.

416: I want to learn more from this mission - things I can't learn in Squad 404 - to better prepare myself for the future.

Gr G11: 416, you'll be back, right? It's tiring having to walk by myself.

416: I will return once the mission is accomplished.

416: But you still ought to train properly. One day, you'll have to change, too.

Gr G11: Ughhh... I'll...try.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, 416!

UMP9: SOP-II...she's calling for you. We'll be going then. You know where to find us.

UMP9: You must come back. Otherwise, when 45 wakes up—

416: I'm not coming back for her. She can think whatever she wants.

416: But I WILL come back. You know I'm a Doll of my word.

UMP9: Alright... I get it...

416: Good. I'll be right back.

...

M4 SOPMOD II: 416...

M4 SOPMOD II: Are you sure you wanna come?

416: Both Griffin's and 404's transports have already left, I have no other options now.

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha...

M4 SOPMOD II: I thought you...were a really tough person.

416: I've only realized recently that I'm actually not.

416: I'm scared...experience that I don't have, unknown enemies, unfamiliar companions...

416: If I can't overcome these problems, I won't survive on the battlefield in the future.

M4 SOPMOD II: Have you figured out how to overcome them then?

416: Of course.

416: All it takes is for me to enjoy them for what they are.

...

Nyto: Your account matches our information.

Nyto: Squad 404's current whereabouts are unknown, but 416 will lead us to them.

Nyto: You know where she is, correct?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto: Indeed, we have no evidence to either support or refute your claim.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto: We know. It is an answer we expected.
If choice 3 was picked

Nyto: Then I can assume that she does not trust you all that much.

Nyto: But it matters not. We have a way to find out.

One of the Nytos takes a syringe out of a box. I know what that is.

Nyto: You have probably undergone resistance training, but this will open up certain possibilities for us.

The Nyto injects the truth serum into my body.

Nyto: What we wish to see is the regret on your face after you spill everything.

Nyto: Give us the satisfaction, Griffin Commander.

My mind begins to unwind. I can tell the serum is kicking in.

I know how to deal with it, but I'm not sure how well it'll work.

I must believe the story I'm about to tell... I must believe it myself...

Calm T-Doll's Voice: You've bought us time, Commander. We have already infiltrated the hospital, but it's going to take a little longer to sabotage the surveillance instruments and take care of the guards. Hang in there.

Calm T-Doll's Voice: Oh, and thank you for your stories. They're positively compelling.

Nyto: Griffin Commander, we are now entering the final stage of the interrogation.

Nyto: Tactical Dolls M4 SOPMOD II and 416 both took part in the operation to rescue a certain human.

Nyto: Angelia, former Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We need to know the whereabouts of these three individuals. You must start from the beginning so we can facilitate our fact checks.

Angelia... I know that...

To prevent myself from telling the truth, I must believe the things I "recall" in my mind.

I have to let myself drift along in the ocean...and capture every piece of fantasy that I think is real...

I know what's the most believable in Ange's case...

...Death.

Nyto: ...Tell us, and you can live.

I'll have to cover up the truth with all sorts of deaths...

But I must also remember the truth...

Where Ange has gone... How I ended up here... I must remember it all...

This will be the final story, I'll arrive at my own ending very soon. I hope that the ladies of 404 will make it a good one.

Angelia: It took me two minutes...

Angelia: ...to regain my consciousness.

Angelia: I spent ten minutes...

Angelia: ...groveling on the ground, crawling on all fours, leaning against cover, and doing some feeble first-aid on myself - but it's better than nothing.

Angelia: I spent a minute...

Angelia: ...thinking.

Angelia: ...Trying to figure out if I was alive or dead.

Angelia: Then it took me ten seconds to arrive at the conclusion...

Angelia: I'm still alive, but I'll be dead soon.

Angelia: Cough...

Angelia: Cough...

Angelia: This is unbearable... my body isn't working properly...

Angelia: M4A1...

Angelia: AK-12...

Angelia: Can you hear me? What's your situation? And the mastermind? Did you intercept her?

...

...There is only static in the channel.

Angelia: Tsk... this place is too saturated with radiation for comms to work. I must...get out of here...

Angelia: I don't know if this body...can even handle a fight...

...Ange shoves her communicator into her pocket with great difficulty.

Angelia: I can't say I don't care about my physical appearance at all, so I have no desire to find out what my face looks like right now.

Angelia: But judging by my hands...I must look like a proper monster.

Angelia: I will eventually succumb to death...and something worse...

Angelia: Cough! Cough!

Angelia: I know what that is...

??: GUARGHHHHH!!

Angelia: ...!

...Blood-curdling howls can be heard from afar.

Angelia: ...It's them. I know these ominous howls. The stuff of nightmares from even before WWIII.

Angelia: My wheezing and coughing will draw them this way. I have to leave this place...soon!

Later... Ange hides behind cover and the communicator suddenly comes to life.

Persica: Ange! Ange, are you alright?! You didn't answer for so long! I thought you'd...

Angelia: Cough...I won't turn into what you thought so easily...

Havier: Ange, I knew you'd be alright—

Havier: Haha, that's a lie. I was certain that you died, but you actually survived. This is the second time you surprised me.

Angelia: Sorry for defying your expectations and not dying. Let's compare notes. I'm still within the contamination zone but I can't get in touch with Task Force DEFY.

Angelia: If they didn't complete the mission, we must have a back-up plan for the back-up plan...

Angelia: I know you don't really give a damn about whether I live or die, Havier, but it doesn't hurt to ask - can you give us any kind of support? I'll take anything.

Havier: You know I can't bypass Statesec's authority to lend you aid. Why don't you ask your chief?

Angelia: You must be joking!

Angelia: I even detonated that freaking dirty bomb! NOW you're telling me you can't bypass some goddamn authority?!

Havier: Calm down, young lady. Getting worked up will accelerate the infection.

Angelia: ...You know I'm infected?

Havier: Anyone inside the irradiation zone of a Collapse Fluid dirty bomb is definitely going to be affected by Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease. Whether you can make it out alive depends entirely on your endurance. At least, judging by your reaction, your current physical condition seems to be alright.

Angelia: Well, thanks for the praise...

Persica: Don't be hasty, Ange. Havier has been coordinating reinforcements the whole time. Let him finish, okay?

Angelia: Fine...cough...I guess...

Havier: Sorry, let's cut to the chase. I will try to get in touch with your Chief Zelinsky.

Havier: But I know even you can tell that the chances of him sending in reinforcements are close to nil. That's why you haven't contacted him yourself, isn't that right?

Angelia: Indeed, I won't put my hopes on them. Especially since I set off the dirty bomb, I've effectively aligned myself against the chief...

Havier: However, I won't let him hinder our efforts, which is why Persica and I have already come up with a solution for you.

Havier: Rather than relying on others, why not solve the problem yourself? Explain away, Persica.

Persica: Sorry, Ange. You said before that with their current armaments, T-Dolls cannot fight the military on even ground. It got me thinking...

Persica: You remember that the Griffin Commander once captured a Sangvis Ringleader?

Angelia: You mean...the Doll...known as "Architect"?

Havier: I applaud your memory. She is a fantastic technological sample. Very willing to cooperate, too.

Havier: Persica has collected a lot of data from her and her weaponry and created some new stuff out of them.

Angelia: You developed weapons using the enemy's anatomy?

Havier: Don't worry. We didn't thank her.

Havier: Persica has been conducting related research on her. Theoretically speaking, T-Dolls can be equipped with some sort of heavy weaponry, which will make them more powerful. Naturally, the cost of research and development will be quite considerable. After all, programming an AI capable of allowing multiple T-Dolls to control complex weapons isn't exactly cheap.

Angelia: Control heavy weapons? But doesn't this go against the terms and conditions regarding armaments of PMCs?

Havier: It's expensive, dangerous, and illegal. This kind of stuff doesn't sell at all. Theoretically, as an investor, I should stop Persica from pouring resources into this research.

Angelia: But you're exactly the kind of guy that likes playing with such dangerous things...

Havier: "Boring weapons are worthless!" You'd better thank me for being exactly the kind of guy that might just save you.

Angelia: Cough... You have my deepest gratitude...

Angelia: Still, you're wrong about one thing, Havier - the likelihood of me escaping successfully is infinitesimal.

Angelia: The one I want you to aid is the Griffin Commander. Hand those expensive, dangerous, and illegal toys of yours to the Commander, and Griffin's forces might just get out of this...

Persica: What? But you need help the most...!

Angelia: Me? What else can I do...? I'm taking my last breaths in the epicenter of the irradiation zone. I can't pursue the mastermind, nor do I have any T-Dolls with me to fight off the military...

Angelia: Even if you send your heavy weapons over, they'll only be dealing with some ELID zombies... Havier, I'm sure you won't invest in something unprofitable, right?

Havier: ...

Persica: But...

Angelia: I'm merely stating facts. You know I only ever consider the consequences when planning my moves.

Havier: Are you certain? You honestly think this commander is worth trading your life for?

Angelia: It's not a trade, but one's choice... and I don't plan on giving up on myself just yet...

Angelia: The fact is that I'm in no shape to supervise the situation. Giving them to the commander might still give us a chance.

Angelia: Besides, this commander's mettle has already been tested during the fight against the military. If DEFY needs help, the commander won't just sit back and do nothing...

Angelia: Not to mention even if the mission fails...at least Griffin will survive.

Havier: Should I be touched on Griffin's behalf?

Angelia: I was part of them for a while. I liked it there...

Angelia: Hurry up. If you tarry any longer, even Griffin will be lost.

...Havier lets out a heavy sigh on the other end of the call.

Havier: You know I won't abandon you, but I also understand where you're coming from.

Havier: I know the commander you speak of, but I don't have the coordinates.

Angelia: If Griffin hasn't switched position yet, the commander should still be at the temporary command post.

Angelia: The base is a fair bit of distance away from Ground Zero. There should be other T-Dolls and employees who survived as well. On top of giving them reinforcements, I hope you can also help them evacuate...

Havier: I'd like to help, but you're the only one with a satellite communicator. We can't get in touch with the Commander.

Angelia: I'll try to find a base where I can set up a comms channel...but I'm not sure if I can do that...

Havier: You'd better hurry. Do that, and you could still be cured of your infection.

Havier: I'll be away for a while to get clearance for the mobilization of transports. I hope you'll stay alive till then.

Havier leaves the conversation.

Persica: Since you know Griffin's location, if you can withdraw to their security zone...

Angelia: I know. That's my last chance. But do as I say first... I'll try my best to get myself over...

Angelia: The ELIDs are getting close. I gotta move. Talk to you later.

Persica: Ange, wait! We'll do everything we can to—

...Ange terminates the transmission.

Angelia: If you had seen my face, you'd know there's nothing you can do.

Angelia: Of course, there is the possibility that I won't even have this face for long...

...Ange leans against the wall and sighs.

Angelia: What a drag... I don't wanna move at all...

...The footsteps and howling are getting closer and closer.

Angelia: Tsk, they've noticed me...

Angelia: I might not have long to live...but dying here is too pathetic...

Angelia: C'mon, Ange. Just go a bit farther...

...Ange dashes over to the next cover object. The monstrous howls follow her like a shadow.

Angelia: I'm almost at my limit...

Angelia: Is my body finally giving out...?

??: GUARGHHHHH!!

Angelia: Where is it...?

Angelia: It's closing in...

Angelia: Where the hell is it?!

Angelia: ...!

Angelia: From behind!

...Ange spins around and shoots the monster with her pistol!

...Her aim was true, but...!

??: GUARGHHHHH!!

Angelia: That didn't kill you?

Angelia: As expected of an...

Angelia: E!

Angelia: L!

Angelia: I!

Angelia: D!

Angelia: IN! FECT! ED!

...

...The monster flops onto the ground.

Angelia: (Pants)

Angelia: (Pants)

Angelia: Cough...

Angelia: So...they CAN be killed.

ELID: GUARGHHHHH!!

...More ELIDs come creeping en masse!

Angelia: Did the gunfire attract them?

...Ange pulls the trigger again, but she's out of ammo.

Angelia: I knew it...

...Ange drops the pistol and steps out with open arms.

Angelia: Fine, this place it is. I hope no one sees me.

ELID: GUARGHHHHH!!

??: My...you've even got your last words figured out, eh?

??: Sorry, we came too early.

Angelia: You two...

Angelia: Sort this out while I still have the will to change my mind.

...

...

Angelia: How did you find me...?

AK-12: You kept hailing us. We couldn't communicate, but it helped us lock onto your coordinates.

AK-12: We thought you weren't going to last long, but you were surprisingly quick on your feet. We've been killing these things and running after you the whole time.

Angelia: Tsk, so my instinct of not wanting to move was right.

AK-12: Who would've thought these things actually do exist? And here I thought some of that training would never come in useful.

...AK-12 flips an ELID corpse over with her foot.

AK-12: Still, they're nothing more than disgusting and pathetic monsters.

AN-94: So this is a person infected by the Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease...

Angelia: We usually just call them ELIDs. Is this the first time you've seen them? They are quite rare after WWIII.

Angelia: Most people with lower endurance will die directly to the radiation, but this is what happens to the healthier ones when the infection worsens. The flesh undergoes silication, the mind deteriorates, and they become highly aggressive before they truly die.

Angelia: Be glad that the explosion only happened a short while ago. The longer they stay within the irradiation zone, the more fearsome these humans become.

AK-12: Are these ELIDs all soldiers from the military caught in the explosion of the Collapse Fluid dirty bomb detonated by M4A1?

Angelia: Yes. It hasn't been long, so only those in areas close to Ground Zero have turned so far.

Angelia: But the radiation is spreading, and the humans who didn't retreat in time will soon join them...

Angelia: ...Like me.

AN-94: Not for the time being. I am administering some simple treatment on you. Please hang in there.

...AK-12 picks up the pistol on the ground.

Angelia: It's out of ammo.

AK-12: At least make it easier for me to identify your corpse.

...Ange laughs and winces in pain. She takes the firearm.

Angelia: Cough... It's not efficient to identify corpses from the weapon they carry.

AN-94: Keep still, Ange. I am still disinfecting your wounds.

Angelia: It won't work. Cough... This is Collapse Fluid radiation... The surface of the skin will fester then silicate. Disinfecting it is no use at all...

Angelia: The muscles and blood vessels will also gradually harden... The pain is unimaginable to you T-Dolls...

Angelia: I was lucky to last long enough for you to show up. I thought you'd gone after M4A1...

AN-94: M4A1 is pursuing Mastermind, who was brought onboard the military's Intercontinental Railway.

AK-12: AR-15 went off with her. We couldn't stop her.

Angelia: Then you should've followed them. I told you, that was your mission.

AN-94: We did our job by giving them cover as they got onboard. The train departed, and there was nothing else we could do.

AN-94: Our mission is over. What matters now is you.

Angelia: Me? There might still be hope for you if you leave me behind. Take the communicator and get in touch with Persica, then follow her instructions and withdraw.

AK-12: You're giving up already? Ange, since when are you so pessimistic?

Angelia: Are you confident you can prop me up with one arm and shoot at enemies with the other?

Angelia: On top of dealing with these zombie movie extras, there's still the military. They won't be completely paralyzed by just an explosion.

Angelia: If Yegor is still alive, he'll only have one objective - to seek revenge. In other words, to do us in......

AN-94: Then we withdraw. Leave this place behind.

AN-94: There may still be Griffin Dummies for us to use along the way. We can make it.

Angelia: All signals are jammed in the contamination zone. Comms and all navigation systems are down. I don't even know where to go.

Angelia: How about this...? I'm getting tired... I need some sleep...

AK-12: Ange!

Smack!

AK-12 slaps Ange hard on the face.

AK-12: You asked us to take the communicator and contact Persica, which means we do have a plan. So long as we can find our way out of the contamination zone, we can withdraw, am I right?

Angelia: ...

AK-12: I know you're in great pain, but it's not like you at all to give up just like that.

AK-12: I remember you still owe us a drink. If you want an easy way out, then let me do you a favor and send you off painlessly.

AK-12 aims her weapon at Ange's head.

AN-94: 12...nyet...!

The very air seems to freeze. A good few seconds have passed.

Angelia: Hnng...pfft...

Angelia: Hahahahahaha...

Angelia: Ow, ow, ow...

Angelia: Dammit. Shouldn't have laughed so hard...

AK-12's arms are trembling slightly.

Angelia: Just rejecting my command is almost overloading your neural module, eh? If you have a neural meltdown here, there's no one left to get me out.

AK-12: Looks like bluffing doesn't work on you.

Angelia: I programmed your IFF codes myself. I must say, I'm surprised you even dared point your gun at me.

AK-12: We're called "DEFY". Just living by the name, I guess? You ought to know we're different than your past subordinates.

Angelia: Humph...thanks for the reminder. I almost forgot that utterly insignificant detail.

Angelia: AN-94, cease the treatment. We're setting off now.

AN-94: But I have not finished dressing the infected wounds...

Angelia: Save it. It does no good anyway; we might as well start moving.

AK-12: Aren't you gonna jauntily brief us on the plan first, as usual?

Angelia: Plan? The plan is to move north in a straight line and go as far as we can.

AK-12: Why north? And are you sure about moving in a straight line? There are still loads of ELIDs out there. Won't it be safer to take a more evasive route?

Angelia: The only security zone still in one piece is in the north. We humans are taught when we're kids that the shortest distance between two points is always a straight line. Now is the time to place my bet on that.

AK-12: If you say so. 94, there are approximately 20 ELIDS in the immediate vicinity. Prepare for battle.

AK-12: I'll forge the way. You stick with Ange like glue.

AN-94: Understood. I will guard her carefully.

AK-12: Then let's get moving!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Task Force DEFY charge ahead blindly until they come across a communications outpost.

Angelia: There it is! Cough...get in!

AK-12: Nyet, this place isn't clean at all. We can't stop here!

Angelia: Obey my orders! Hurry...cough!

...Task Force DEFY enters the outpost.

AK-12: The radiation level is too high here. New ELIDs will emerge anytime. We can't stay here for long.

Angelia: Cough...do as I say...

Angelia: Now, turn on the comms system...and scan for signals!

AK-12: On it. The instrument isn't too badly damaged. Attempting to reactivate it...

AK-12: This equipment is left behind by the military. I've bypassed the firewall. 94, you can now try to access their network and collect some data.

AN-94: Understood. Scanning...

AN-94: Bad news. I have hacked into the system and reassembled information regarding the topography. Units bearing military signals are already on the move in this area.

AN-94: Judging by their speed and formation, they do not seem to be ELIDs.

AN-94: I would assume that they are reorganizing their remaining troops. In the worst-case scenario, they have already discovered us.

Angelia: Then let's pray they haven't, or we're dead...cough...

Angelia: Quick, still remember the Griffin Commander's comms frequency...? Try to get in touch.

AK-12: Are you sure? Gathering information in a data blackout is one thing, sending a transmission from a military outpost is another matter. There's no way we can hide our tracks - they're gonna surround this place and blast us to bits.

Angelia: This is our only chance if we want to walk out of this building alive...

Angelia: We've come this far, we have no other choice but to raise the stakes. Establish a connection immediately. If we're fast enough, we might be able to leave before the military reacts!

AK-12: Got it. Establishing a communications channel. Ready in thirty seconds.

Angelia: While this battered communicator still has some battery left... Persica. Persica, do you copy?

Persica: There's a bit of static, but I can hear you. How are you doing, Ange?

Angelia: My satellite communicator is almost out of juice. Let's keep it short.

Angelia: DEFY found me. I'm relatively safe for now. We're using a military outpost to establish comms. Whether the Griffin Commander gets it is up to chance.

AK-12: We're transmitting. Pick up...please pick up...

...Nothing but static.

【Static】......

......

Angelia: So Griffin has left already...

Angelia: This...is how it ends...

Persica: Ange...

Angelia: Haha... Can't be helped. I didn't expect it to end like this...

AK-12: Wait! There's a reply!

Angelia: What?! Who is it on the other end?

Persica: It's the commander! Commander, can you hear me? It's Persica!

Commander: ...
If choice 2 was picked

Persica: That's Angelia...

Persica: Uh...I think you know who she is. I'll let her do the talking.
If choice 1 was picked

Persica: Humph. Don't worry about me, worry about yourselves.

Persica: Ange is here. There's a favor she needs to ask.
If choice 3 was picked

Persica: Forgotten all about your technical supervisor already? You're getting a pay cut.

Persica: Enough jokes. Ange needs to talk to you.

Angelia: Hello, Commander. This isn't the first time we talked, but it's the first time I'm introducing myself.

Angelia: "Angelia". Of course, it's just my codename, but I quite like the name, so feel free to call me that.

Angelia: I'm an agent from the Bureau of State Security. We've worked together numerous times in the past. I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but you must understand that we're on the same side.

Persica: I can vouch for her. I've known her for years. She's a nice person, but she does have a bad temper.

Angelia: Whatever, Persica... Our channel won't hold for long, so please listen to me.

Angelia: I understand you've suffered heavy casualties, so Persica is going to provide you with Heavy Ordnance Corps to aid you in battle.

Angelia: Send the coordinates to Persica where you need help. She'll find a way to deliver them there. Persica, how's Havier's withdrawal plan coming along?

Persica: Havier has already provided me with the extraction point, but said it'll still take a while for the transports to get clearance into the area.

Angelia: I've sent you the coordinates, Commander. Guard the extraction point with your life. I hope you'll last till the tranports get there.

AK-12: Ange, we've been discovered. A transmission is forcing its way through.

Yegor: Ange... 【static】I know it's you... I will make you pay for what you've done【static】!

Angelia: Cut him off. I've got no time to chat with him.

AK-12: Okay.

Yegor's transmission is cut off.

Angelia: As you can see, Commander, the situation isn't looking good. We should all prepare for the worst.

Persica: Commander, we've given you everything we can. I hope we'll all come out of this alive...so please find a way to help Ange...

Angelia: Commander, you can't save everyone on the battlefield... Ensure Griffin's safety first. Only consider our rescue if it's at all possible.

Angelia: I'll send all the information I have to you. AK-12, set up the data transfer.

AK-12: On it.

Angelia: If I can't make it, please take care of Task Force DEFY, find the AR Team, and stop the enemies who want to destroy our future.

AN-94: Ange, the military units we detected are closing in.

Angelia: Tsk...he really hates us to the bone. Commander, we'll wait till dawn. No matter what you choose to do, no one will blame you. Good luck.

AK-12: Data transfer in progress. We can move in 60 seconds.

Angelia: Persica...I'd better go. If I come back alive, I think I'm gonna get a cat.

Persica: Can I come over and pat it?

Angelia: As long as you pay for the cat food...

Persica: I will, so you better make sure you come back alive.

Angelia: I really can't say for sure this time...

AK-12: Transfer complete. We can go.

AN-94: This means we will not be able to contact anybody from now on. We can only feel our way around the dark on our own or wait for Griffin's signal.

Angelia: I know... Let's go. We must hold out till the commander comes to our rescue.

A few hours later, 416 and SOP-II's team killed the black-clad Doll and her mysterious troops. Griffin's withdrawal is almost complete.

416: Commander, Kalina and the final batch of T-Dolls are about to withdraw on the last carrier.

416: SOP-II and I plus a few other T-Dolls and the HOCs have volunteered for this rescue mission. Our objective is to escort you safely off the battlefield.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

416: What? Not you? Then who could it be?
If choice 2 was picked

416: No? What do you mean, Commander?

416: ...Ange?

416: You mean Ange is still alive?! Is that true?

416: ...But...are you sure you want us to rescue her instead? The battlefield is filled with danger. We may even run into the military's main force.

416: I understand. We will designate Angelia as our priority target.

416: Please don't misunderstand, Commander. I don't have any misgivings about the mission. Deep down in my neural cloud, I was hoping you'd do it.

416: However, I don't want to regret not saving you. I hope there will still be a chance for that...

416: I'll go explain the plan to UMP9. The rescue mission will commence in ten minutes.

...Ten minutes later, 416 and SOP-II lead their fellow T-Dolls on the way to rescue Ange. At the same time, they are briefed on the information the commander obtained from the communication and data transfer with Ange.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Commander, is that what Miss Ange said?

M4 SOPMOD II: She gave you all the information she'd collected before the dirty bomb went off?

M4 SOPMOD II: Why...did she do that?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: She was prepared to sacrifice herself...again?
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange finally learned. But in other words, she had known the dirty bomb would go off...

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, are you sure we should prioritize rescuing Miss Ange?

M4 SOPMOD II: We're not sure if she's still alive or if she's left her last known location.

M4 SOPMOD II: On the other hand...we're a lot more likely to succeed in rescuing you.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Spoken just like the commander would, even though no one ever asks that of you.
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah...same here. I'll be very sad if we don't save her.

M4 SOPMOD II: So, let's rescue her! This time, we won't leave her behind!

416: Quick, set up their retreat route, Commander. Then we can guide her with a signal flare.

416: If we have to run all the way to them, we won't make it in time.

M4 SOPMOD II: For Ange's retreat, reaching the area where Cx4 and I withdrew from and following the route we took should be the quickest, and the enemies along the way should pose the smallest threat.

416: That won't work. The radiation keeps spreading; the contamination level has grown so severe the area is already flagged as a Red Zone.

M4 SOPMOD II: "Red Zone"?

416: Red Zones are areas with the highest level of contamination hazard. Exposure for T-Dolls can cause damage but isn't lethal. However, any human who enters will contract ELID and suffer from irreversible effects within a short period of time.

416: Ange is already infected. No matter how short the route is, it is highly unlikely for her to survive the trip. If she takes a detour, there's another viable route through the Yellow Zone, which has a lower contamination level.

M4 SOPMOD II: But she'll run into a lot more ELIDs and may even come under the military's attack!

M4 SOPMOD II: Even in the Yellow Zone, radiation will still accumulate in Ange's body over time, right? She won't have the time to lie low and go around the enemies!

416: Both options are risky. Further argument will only be a waste of precious time. Commander, only you can decide where to guide them.

416: This is the last squad on the battlefield. It is also our final rescue target before we withdraw.

416: Where should we launch the signal flare? Over the Red Zone, where the route is shorter but the radiation is higher, or the Yellow Zone, where there are more enemies? Please make your decision ASAP!

...In the end, I decided to have 416 launch the signal flare over the Red Zone.

AN-94: Ange, a signal flare!

Angelia: That's Griffin's standard issue. The Commander is guiding us!

AN-94: But...that will lead us to the Red Zone. Ange...I do not think it is a wise choice.

AK-12: Ange...you probably won't make it to the security zone.

Angelia: Cough...it's alright... I'll take my chances.

AN-94: This is not something you can overcome with sheer willpower.

AK-12: According to the readings, the contamination level is still climbing in the area. Entering the Red Zone will only exacerbate your symptoms.

Angelia: Which means we don't have time to waste. Let's go!

AN-94: Come, AK-12. The ELIDs are growing in numbers. We cannot delay anymore.

AK-12: I strongly recommend taking the route through the Yellow Zone!

Angelia: I believe in the Commander! Cough... H-hurry!

Angelia: The Commander...cough...is showing us the way...

Angelia: AK-12, AN-94...cough...

Angelia: If...if...you know...

Angelia: Cough...cough, cough...! Cough!

...In the end, I decided to have 416 launch the signal flare over the Yellow Zone.

AK-12: Ange, a signal flare over there!

Angelia: That's Griffin's standard issue. The Commander really is showing us the way!

AK-12: I believe it's leading us to the Yellow Zone. Your body might just make it through.

AN-94: Ange, are you feeling better?

Angelia: Not at all...cough... But I think I'm okay for now.

AK-12: Then we'd better hurry. The ELIDs will find us soon!

AN-94: But we cannot proceed yet.

AN-94: A few military squads are patrolling ahead. We must first discern their patrol routes.

Angelia: Can we draw the military...into fighting the ELIDs?

AK-12: It is possible. According to my observation, the military does attack the ELIDs. I believe they're too obsessed with pursuing us to care about the fact that they're firing upon their own allies and casualties.

AK-12: Still, we can't exploit that too much. Otherwise, if we accidentally draw the attention of both the ELIDs and the military, we'll be heavily outnumbered.

Angelia: You're right...cough... Dammit, let me think...

Angelia: We...can only get closer and try to locate the mark by tracing the signal strength.

AN-94: I do not recommend that. It is chaos on the battlefield. With no communications outpost nearby, we are on our own.

AN-94: Finding a mark or whatever is too dangerous. I suggest we resume our course toward an area with a lower contamination index and launch a signal flare, then wait for the rescue party to find us.

AK-12: It's a risk worth taking. We can't handle the military with just the two of us. Ange doesn't have long.

Angelia: Stop arguing...

Angelia: Let me...think this over...

AK-12: No matter what you decide to do, we can't rest here. Keep moving, Ange.

Angelia: I know...cough...

Angelia: I...I'll...make up my mind soon...

Angelia: Cough...cough, cough!

...In the end, Task Force DEFY decided to give up on finding the mark left by the rescue party, but the withdrawal is still underway.

AN-94: The contamination index is significantly lower here. Though Ange is not entirely out of danger, her life is not under any immediate threat.

AK-12: Congratulations, Ange. You get to live a little longer.

Angelia: I don't feel particularly good, but if that's the case...

AN-94: Since we cannot locate the rescue party's mark, our only choice is to proceed in the direction where the contamination is lower.

AK-12: Or find a chance to send a distress signal for the rescue party to get in touch.

AN-94: That is too dangerous right now. We are surrounded by military forces.

AN-94: Not to mention the ELIDs, who are attracted by the slightest rustles. If reinforcements do not arrive on time, we will not be able to handle the situation with just the two of us.

AK-12: (Sighs) You're always so conservative, AN-94.

AN-94: When it is uncertain where the alternative will lead us, I prefer the current option.

AK-12: The choice isn't yours to make. Ange, take your pick.

Angelia: I... Let me think...

AN-94: Wait, I hear something!

AK-12: Military units! They're heading straight toward us!

AN-94: There is an abandoned trench just ahead. Get Ange in there first!

...Boom! Boom!

AK-12: Hurry, Ange! We're here!

...Under the military's bombardment, Task Force DEFY dive hastily for cover.

Angelia: (Pants) Goddammit!

Angelia: Looks like we don't have much of a choice. AN-94, launch the signal flare!

AN-94: Roger!

AK-12: How did they find us so soon? We shouldn't have left any traces!

Angelia: These maneuvers are planned...unlike before!

...Pzzt...pzzzzt.

??: Angelia...

??: I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

...Over the sound of gunfire and static, a male voice speaks clearly over the communicator's public channel.

Yegor: You survived the explosion...only to give me the chance to kill you with my own hands.

Angelia: Yegor...

Angelia: You don't look much better yourself...

Yegor: I am feeling tremendous. I just finished making the preparations, and there you are.

Angelia: You had it all planned?

Yegor: There aren't many routes toward the Green Zone. If you're alive, you'll definitely show up here.

Yegor: You won't last much longer with that infection. Why not just give up?

Angelia: Why don't YOU give up mourning for your zombie comrades?

Yegor: Good. I'll make sure you don't die from artillery fire.

Yegor: Then I can find you and avenge my subordinates myself!

...Ange closes the channel.

Angelia: He's sending in tanks! Hold out till the rescue party makes it here!

AK-12: Are you sure they'll come?

Angelia: If not, then we'll just die! Hurry, cough!

Angelia: Use whatever you can to hold this trench!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Task Force DEFY gives everything they have to withstand the military's attack.

AK-12: Ange! Is the rescue party still not here?!

Angelia: No, they may be on the way!

AN-94: That sound! Do you hear that, AK-12?!

AK-12: Charging... It's the tank! Duck!!

...BOOOOOOM!!

...

AK-12: Ange! Ange, wake up! Ange!!

AK-12: The trench is lost! AN-94, pick up your gun and cover me!

AN-94: AK-12, you're hurt!

AK-12: I'm fine! Defend the opening!

AK-12: Ange... Ange, are you alright?! Ange!!

AN-94: AK-12, watch out!

...BOOM! BOOM, BOOM!

...In just an instant, whatever's left of Ange's awareness and consciousness is consumed by fire.

...

...Task Force DEFY has finally found the mark left by the rescue team!

M4 SOPMOD II: Surpriiiiise!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahahaha! We finally found you, DEFY!

AN-94: If your movement had been just a little swifter than your utterance, I would have identified you as a hostile target and attacked.

416: Sorry, this is M4 SOPMOD II of the AR Team. SOP-II, meet AK-12 and AN-94 of Task Force DEFY. I'm 416. You've all met me.

AN-94: I do not particularly want to see you again, but it cannot be helped.

416: Right, this isn't the time to deepen our bond. Let's get straight to the point - where is Ange, and how is she?

...AN-94 looks behind her and finds an unconscious Ange draped on AK-12's back.

AN-94: Ange...she—

AK-12: A few minutes ago...she took a heavy dose of radiation and passed out.

AK-12: It took us a while to find the mark, but her life isn't in danger. However, she'll be sitting out the coming battles. It'll be just us.

416: What a shame. Guess I'll have to say hi some other time.

416: Still, it's not "just us". We also have the Commander and the HOCs.

AN-94: What...HOCs?

M4 SOPMOD II: Our new toys! They're giving us long-range support and specialize in fighting tanks! You'll love them!

AK-12: Then we're safe for now. Let's figure out what to do next.

AN-94: The contamination index is significantly lower here. Though Ange is not entirely out of danger, her life is not under any immediate threat.

RO635: Then let's keep moving to less contaminated areas. At this rate, Ange isn't going to last much longer.

AK-12: Hmm? Who was that?

RO635: Oh, don't mind me. Just making a suggestion—

AN-94: Wait, I hear something!

AK-12: Military units! They're heading straight toward us!

AN-94: There is an abandoned trench just ahead. Get Ange in there first!

...Boom! Boom!

AK-12: Hurry up! We're here!

416: HOCs, give us cover!

...Under the HOCs' suppressive fire, Task Force DEFY makes it into the trench safely.

M4 SOPMOD II: We still have loads of cards up our sleeve. Don't worry, we can handle these tanks!

...Pzzt...pzzzzt.

??: Angelia...

??: I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

...Over the sound of gunfire and static, a male voice speaks clearly over the communicator's public channel.

Yegor: You survived the explosion...only to give me the chance to kill you with my own hands.

AK-12: Ange is dead! You can abort your mission!

Yegor: I don't think so. I know she's merely unconscious, just as I knew you'd show up here.

416: He knew we'd come here... He counted on the fact that this is the only route to the Green Zone!

Yegor: I'll make sure you don't die from artillery fire.

Yegor: Then I can find you and avenge my subordinates myself!

...Yegor terminates the transmission.

AK-12: I can hear the tanks! They're coming!

416: Commander, defend the trench with the HOCs!

416: With their help, we'll be absolutely fine!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The Griffin team managed to repel the military's assault for the time being.

416: Now's our chance! Retreat!

M4 SOPMOD II: AK-12, has Ange come about?!

AK-12: There's still a heartbeat! Let's go!

AN-94: Another round and even Ange will not make it. If only we had adrenaline...

416: Adrenaline? Why don't you ask for bread while you're at it?!

416: What matters now is to figure out where to go!

RO635: There's an outpost just ahead. We can seek shelter in there and resuscitate Ange!

M4 SOPMOD II: Then let's be on our way! The enemies are gonna catch up soon!

AN-94: So...that Dinergate...

RO635: It isn't important! Just run!

Angelia: I'm...still alive?

AK-12: Da, we're all still alive.

Angelia: How?

AN-94: Hope has appeared.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange!

Angelia: SOP-II?

Angelia: Is...is that you?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's me! Didn't expect to see me, did you?

Angelia: You seem so different. The thing on your shoulder...

RO635: Oh...don't mind me. Just know that I'm your ally. Good evening, Miss Ange.

Angelia: Hello... That color scheme looks very familiar. The voice also rings...

416: Sorry. There's a lot of interference in the contamination zone; we couldn't isolate your frequency so we had to rush over here on foot.

416: After all, the radiation is still spreading erratically and so is the outbreak. As long as we remain in the theater, we can run into ELIDs anywhere.

Angelia: 416...you came as well?

416: Surprised?

Angelia: What about the others in Squad 404?

416: UMP45 is badly injured, so the others have withdrawn to take care of her. Sorry they didn't have time to say hello.

Angelia: That's fine. I'd feel a lot better with the whole squad here, but even you are no match against the military's tanks on your own.

416: We know, which is why the commander has mobilized the HOCs to help us defend the trench!

AN-94: That might not be enough. As illustrated by the previous encounter, we can only hold off the military's attack temporarily.

416: We've also brought along some comms equipment that we can use to contact the commander, but it'll take some time to assemble. Activating it will also draw the military's attention.

AK-12: We clearly don't have time for that.

AK-12: Yegor is amassing the entirety of the military's remaining forces to annihilate us. They'll have this bunker surrounded in no time.

AN-94: Da, the military is going to launch the next round of attacks any minute. We must come up with a contingency as soon as possible.

M4 SOPMOD II: We have no choice but to make a run for it now, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's destroy all enemies in the way while the encirclement isn't complete yet!

416: The military's rear forces will get into position soon so that's too risky.

416: Maybe we should be stealthier and sneak around their scouts to get out of here.

Angelia: If we fight our way out, we must eliminate all enemies as fast as we can and will possibly have to deal with their reinforcements...

Angelia: If we sneak out, and their detectors are too perceptive; we could run the risk of being discov—

Angelia: Cough...cough! Cough, cough!

AK-12: Ange!

AN-94: Ange was caught in the explosion just now. The Collapse Fluid is eating away at her body even more quickly. We're running out of time!

Angelia: Then let's go...cough!

Angelia: In any case, we must get outta here...cough, cough!

Angelia: Cough, cough, cough, cough!!

Angelia: I can't... my body...is already...

Angelia: I can't give up... I can't give up!

Angelia: I can't let them come all this way for nothing! There must be another way!

...

...Meanwhile, Yegor is observing Ange's hideout.

Yegor: That bitch has slinked into the bunkers there. With that infection, she must be trying to slip off to somewhere with less contamination.

Yegor: The only card in her hand is the few HOCs, but they'll be crushed easily once our main force gets here.

Military Corporal: Sir, we just received a report. Our artillery force's ETA has been pushed back by 15 minutes.

...Yegor turns around.

Yegor: 15 minutes? What's taking them so long? Have they encountered enemies?

Military Corporal: They have run into a group of ELIDs. They wish to avoid a direct confrontation and are considering taking a detour.

Yegor: I thought I'd made myself clear. Destroy all ELIDs on sight. Tell them to get their asses over here.

Military Corporal: Sir, you should know who these ELIDs are. They—

...Yegor grabs his subordinate by the collar.

Yegor: I know them better than you, Corporal!

...Yegor grits his teeth. The lesions spread across his face make his appearance all the more twisted and disfigured.

Then he loosens his grip, and the subordinate backs off. Yegor sits down on a pile of supply boxes and takes a deep breath.

Yegor: I know full well these are my comrades - my brothers.

Yegor: Many of them have been going through death and destruction by my side for over a decade. The nuclear missiles in WWIII didn't kill us. Not to mention the T-Dolls...we even managed to escape from those true instruments of death.

Yegor: But today...they died at the hands of that crazy bitch. She detonated a Collapse Fluid bomb just to impede us.

...Yegor's gaze bore into everyone present.

Yegor: I know, wars are supposed to be devoid of honor and emotion, but you should also know...the one who hates the idea of killing these ELIDs the most is the one who has to give the order - ME!

Yegor: But now, you have all seen for yourselves the damage Collapse Fluid can wreak... That's right, I'll give it to you straight - these brothers are beyond our help. We cannot save them.

Yegor: All we can do is avenge them, and we could miss our chance because of a minute's delay...

Yegor: Now, Corporal, do I have to repeat everything I just said to them myself?

Military Corporal: No, sir. They'll be here right away.

...The corporal speaks into his communicator, and the sound of heavy bombardment comes from a distance.

Yegor: May their spirits rest in peace... Now, we seek vengeance from the culprit herself!

...Yegor rises to his feet.

Yegor: The main force is on its way. Complete the encirclement ASAP and tighten our security. We mustn't let them take a single step out of here before the artillery force completely flattens this place!

Yegor: We have to destroy them here, and this is our only chance!

...The rescue party is trying to break through the encirclement.

416: Something's not right! The military has changed the way they position their troops! They must've called for reinforcements!

AK-12: Nyet...not reinforcements...

AK-12: It's their main force!

Yegor: I'll admit, Ange, you're better than most of the pros I've met...

Yegor: ...at dying!

Yegor: My artillery force is getting into position. We'll see how much of a beating your mongrel T-Dolls can take!

Yegor: And I wonder just how tough you really are! It's time to pay your dues, Angelia!

M4 SOPMOD II: That bastard is insane! He's trying to raze this place to the ground!

AN-94: Their main force is advancing! Ange, should we fall back or—

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange passed out! We're on our own!

416: Without Ange in command, we can't put together an effective escape plan!

AN-94: AK-12, what...should we do?

AK-12: Keep calm. Abort the objective to escape.

AK-12: Fall back to the trench and prepare to defend it!

RO635: This isn't a fair fight...

RO635: I'm afraid...we...

Military Corporal: Sir, Ange's troops have pulled back. Our main force has also pinned down their HOCs. Should we push forward?

Yegor: Those T-Dolls will surely put up a fight. Even if we storm the hideout, their firepower is still a threat.

Yegor: I don't care how many are sacrificed for victory, but I can't be so brash when it comes to vengeance. I can't let any more subordinates die at the hands of those slipshod tin cans.

Military Corporal: Then what are your orders, sir?

Yegor: Out of us all, which unit has killed the most ELIDs?

Military Corporal: The artillery force. They left no survivors along the way to get here as fast as they could.

Yegor: Just as I thought. Let them come forward and do the honor.

Yegor: We'll just have to stay out here and catch our rats.

Yegor: Let the artillery force channel all their wrath and raze everything to the ground! Burn that bitch and her homemaker Dolls till not even their ashes remain!

...An hour later.

...Yegor stands before the bombardment site and beholds the masterpiece he created with artillery fire.

...Griffin's shelter is engulfed in a sea of fire and destruction. He walks away from this scorching inferno with his subordinates.

Yegor: In the end, my subordinate spotted Ange's corpse in the crater. Her face was obscured by the flaming tendrils dancing around her.

Yegor: My greatest regret right now is that humans don't get to live a second time.

Yegor: I did not get to savor the face she made as she faced her death - the desperate blubbering of a coward or the calm determination of a hero.

Yegor: Whichever it was, I have sadly missed it.

Yegor: Of course, this tiny regret is inconsequential compared to the gratification of our vengeance.

Yegor: Once we have confirmed all the facts, we can move on...

Yegor: We need to put the comrades shuffling around the battlefield to rest, then erase anything unnecessary.

Yegor: In any case, this accursed strife is finally coming to an end.

Yegor: It's all just a matter of time, but only those who survived can take their time to write down the history.

...

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...

...The rescue party's stealthy retreat is discovered by the military!

Yegor: So you really decided to sneak away, vile rats!

Yegor: Artillery force, fire at the target area!

Yegor: All other units, block all the exits! Kill everything on sight!

416: We're busted. The military is on our tail!

RO635: They're not pursuing us. They're trying to blow us to pieces with artillery fire!

M4 SOPMOD II: Isn't that worse?!

Yegor: We have you completely surrounded! You'll either die from the artillery fire or my own bullets!

AK-12: Run! Don't look back!

M4 SOPMOD II: 94, don't drop Ange! We'll cover you!

AN-94: Which way should we move, Ange?

AN-94: ...Ange? Hey, Ange!

RO635: Ange passed out! We must get out of here ASAP!

M4 SOPMOD II: Shut up, RO! You're slowing down my reaction speed!

RO635: I'm scanning the terrain! That's more important than whatever you're doing!

RO635: Yegor is bluffing - the military hasn't completely surrounded this area. There is an opening right ahead of us!

RO635: Run to the cover over there and head east, 4 o'clock! Don't let the enemies intercept you!

AK-12: Follow RO's direction! We're making a run for it!

...Ten minutes later.

Military Corporal: Sir, Ange's party slipped through the encirclement.

Yegor: I saw that five minutes ago. You got outrun by a few Dolls?

Military Corporal: Our pursuit was less efficient than we expected. Their HOCs kept disrupting our attempts.

Yegor: Their firepower doesn't pose much threat to us. Send out the high-mobility units first and confirm their whereabouts. Is the drone still not ready?

Military Corporal: It's still being repaired. We can only scan for their signals at the moment, but have no way of confirming visuals. However, their movements are still clearly traceable with our surveillance.

Military Corporal: And sir, there is an abandoned structure in the direction Ange's party is headed toward. They are very likely to seek refuge in there.

Yegor: We're in the heart of the battlefield; they have no hope of getting help. Capturing them is only a matter of time!

Yegor: They'll be digging their own graves when they walk inside that building. I will savor her despair and kill her with my own hands!

...Meanwhile, the rescue party is on the run.

RO635: AK-12, I see an abandoned building just ahead. With a thick exterior wall, the radiation should be lower inside.

RO635: We can take refuge in there to treat Ange and contact the Commander.

AN-94: The military will find us and have us surrounded.

M4 SOPMOD II: Or...just demolish the building with their tanks...

416: Their tanks won't get here so soon. I'm guessing only their mechanical units or human soldiers will enter the building.

416: And you heard Yegor - he wants to seek revenge against Ange himself.

416: So should we all head inside and set up our defenses?

AN-94: That will be more secure, but having all our signals in one place will make us too conspicuous.

AN-94: If only AK-12 and I are in the building, we can hoodwink their scans by camouflaging our signals.

M4 SOPMOD II: 416 and I can only disguise ourselves as Sangvis signals, which is basically useless against the Military.

AK-12: If we do that, we'll have to split up. You can figure out a way to draw the military away so that we have more time to wake Ange up.

AK-12: But even for me...this is a bit too risky...

M4 SOPMOD II: The military may be able to detect Ange's biological signs. If they do enter the building, you three will be in grave danger!

AN-94: But even if we all engage the military right here in the building, the odds are still against us.

416: AK-12, you're the leader now. You decide.

416: Do we all go in, or do just the two of you stay with Ange while the rest of us draw the enemies away?

416: We're about to reach the building, so make up your mind soon!

...The final decision is to have everyone enter the building and set up defenses.

AN-94: I do not think...this is safe.

AK-12: The military will find us, but we'll be prepared.

416: AK-12, we're all ready.

M4 SOPMOD II: AK-12! The military is coming towards the building. They must've discovered us!

AK-12: That's to be expected, but we don't have a choice.

AK-12: At least, we fight together.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Yeah!

RO635: This is the first time we take the military's main force head-on...

416: For Ange...

AK-12: And for ourselves.

AK-12: AN-94, do you resent the choice I made?

AN-94: I trust you, AK-12.

AN-94: No matter what choices we make, in the end, it always comes down to luck. That is what you said.

AK-12: ...That's true.

AK-12: All we need...is a stroke of luck.

...

Angelia: I had a dream.

Angelia: A dream...where others died for me.

Angelia: I know when I wake up, everything in my dream will come true.

Angelia: But I must wake up.

Angelia: This is something I...must face.

...

Angelia: Yegor...

Yegor: You had very loyal subordinates. They fought to the bitter end, as all Tactical Dolls are expected to.

Yegor: Naturally, their effort was futile against us.

Angelia: They... are they...

Yegor: I left some of them alive. My men are taking them apart downstairs. Some of the stuff in their neural clouds might be worth something.

Yegor: As for you, I've just been waiting for you to wake up. That's all.

Yegor: Got anything else to say?

Yegor: Or are you waiting for more new toys to come to your rescue? Or have you rigged this building with explosives?

Yegor: Sadly, I've searched it thoroughly beforehand. There's nothing here.

Yegor: No reinforcements, no explosives, no Griffin-or-whatever T-Dolls.

Yegor: Yes, that's the face. This is the moment I've been waiting for.

Yegor: ...Now, good night.

...

...Bang!

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...

...

Yegor: Where did Ange run off to?

Military Corporal: According to our scan, Ange and her subordinates are holed up in a complex in the Yellow Zone. Our mechanical units have already locked onto their coordinates.

Military Corporal: It will still take a while for the tanks to arrive at the site, but we have a surveillance outpost right in front of the complex. However, we cannot determine the situation in the outpost remotely.

Yegor: Don't be distracted by unimportant matters. Our soldiers will do their duty...as long as they're alive...

Yegor: Have the unit in pursuit confirm their location and numbers visually. Make sure Ange herself is actually in the building.

Military Corporal: We already scanned their signals ten minutes ago.

Yegor: Signals can be faked. This battle has shown me what 16LAB is capable of and I haven't seen Ange on visuals for quite a while.

Military Corporal: You suspect they've split up?

Yegor: As I said, it's quite possible. Sacrificing several Dolls to save your own life - any human would think it's a decent bargain.

Military Corporal: Our analysis shows that the best time for them to split up would've been when they reached the abandoned structure, but the scan we ran on the area detected no human life signs in the building. There are also no signs indicating that any individuals have entered the building.

Yegor: ...Are you certain?

...Meanwhile.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: AK-12...

AK-12: Ange... Finally...

Angelia: I don't see you like this very often... Did I...die?

AK-12: More than once. And you didn't just die. During resuscitation, you went back and forth between being a corpse and a zombie.

Angelia: That pretty much sums up how I'm feeling...

Angelia: It may just be one last burst of strength, but I feel like I can hold out for a while longer.

AK-12: I don't know when you passed out, but the others have already set off half an hour ago.

AN-94: They faked your bio signs and are playing the decoy with the commander's help to draw the military away and buy us some time.

Angelia: The commander?

AN-94: They left their comms equipment behind. We just finished assembling it. You can contact the commander now.

AN-94: We can't stay here for long. The military forces will catch up very soon. We need you to think of a way out.

Angelia: I get it, I get it... I should come up with something...

Angelia: Give me a map...and water. You'll have to feed it to me. I'm not strong enough...

AK-12: You pushed yourself too hard before. Look, your heart almost stopped beating again.

AN-94: Their mechanical units have not entered the building yet. Your biological signs probably did not register on their scan.

Angelia: I'm still pretty weak, but the military might think I'm already dead. That's bad news...

...Meanwhile.

Yegor: What if...

Yegor: What if Ange isn't giving out bio signs?

Military Corporal: What do you mean?

Yegor: She has a bad case of radiation infection. Can her vital signs be so weak our scanners can't read them?

Military Corporal: ...We can't dismiss...that possibility, but it is highly unlikely.

Yegor: Unlikely, but it's still possible. Look into it. Move closer to the building and observe carefully.

Yegor: Once the pursuit unit has secured the perimeters, or if anything moves inside, enter the building!

Yegor: We can't ignore any possibility, and we mustn't let Ange escape!

Angelia: I just talked to the commander. We must secure our evacuation route.

Angelia: I've marked it out on the map, but there are some military facilities along the way. 416 and the others will have to follow the commander's instructions and destroy them for us to evacuate safely.

AK-12: But just having a route isn't enough.

AN-94: The military scouts are still nearby. The moment we leave, we will be spotted. We must find a way to exit safely...

Angelia: I know that, don't rush me!

Angelia: Let me think...

Angelia: Is there a way to leave the building without alerting the military...?

AK-12: Commander, we're leaving the situation out there to you.

AK-12: We'll protect Ange, so don't worry.

AN-94: But...is there really a way...?

...AN-94 stares at the signal scanner, then suddenly—

AN-94: Ange! New movements from the surrounding enemies!

AK-12: It's their scouts! They seem to be moving towards us!

Angelia: Why...? Have they seen through the ploy?

AK-12: Nyet, but I don't know why! We must climb higher!

Angelia: No! They could just be observing the building. We mustn't move recklessly.

AN-94: So we just...wait?

Angelia: We can't get out anyway. This is all we can do.

Angelia: Just sit here...and wait to hear back from the Commander, then think...

...Meanwhile.

416: Commander! As Ange mentioned, our target is their surveillance outpost.

416: We must eliminate all enemies there in order to secure Ange's evacuation route.

416: Time is short; the Military's main force will be here any minute. Let's get this done ASAP!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...With the HOCs' aid, 416's team swiftly crushes the military's surveillance outpost.

M4 SOPMOD II: All enemies are destroyed. What are you waiting for, 416? Report to the Commander already!

416: Not all. The scanner is reading a few human life signs.

M4 SOPMOD II: Probably just ELIDs. Most of the survivors are unarmed logistics personnel. They either got killed by ELIDs or ran off.

416: Don't let your guard down. Make sure you leave no one alive, no matter who it is...

416: ...They're right behind this door.

...They all stop just outside the medical room. Soft moans and a shuffling noise can be heard through the door.

RO635: (Whispers) There really are people in the room, but judging by their positions, they don't seem to be on guard...

416: (Whispers) Could be ELIDs.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Whispers) In any case, we can't attack unarmed humans!

416: That's not up to you. Just pray our visual reflexes are quicker than our fingers on the trigger.

416: Ready. On three. One...

416: Two...

416: Three!

...Slam! 416 kicks the door open.

ELID: GUARGHHHH!

416: ELID!

...Bang bang!

...416 and SOP-II immediately kill the ELID within.

416: I knew it...

RO635: 416, in the corner...

...416 turns her attention to the corner of the room. A few humans are cowering in fear.

Human female: Please... I'm just a doctor... please...cough...

M4 SOPMOD II: 416, these people are infected, but only mildly.

Human male: I...cough...was just trying to save them...cough...

416: You're not saving anybody. SOP-II, tie them up. We're going.

...416 gets in touch with the commander.

416: Commander, we've seized the surveillance outpost. Now...

416: ...What? Ange may have been discovered?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, how's that possible...?

416: The commander says Yegor's forces...probably realized they hadn't seen Ange with us.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then what should we do? If the military storms the building, this would've been a fool's errand, and we won't make it back in time...

416: Their scouts haven't moved in yet. They're probably monitoring us remotely at the same time to visually confirm if Ange really isn't with us.

416: What do we do, Commander? Should we return to the building and help Ange?

...In the comms window, SOP-II is tying up the army doctors behind 416.

M4 SOPMOD II: 416, I found some adrenaline! It could be useful for Ange!

416: Take it. If you can't think of anything, we'll have no choice but to turn back, Commander.

Commander: Hmm...
If choice 1 was picked

416: Raw materials?

416: Commander...what are you looking at? Those humans? I believe this is beyond a T-Doll's understanding.
If choice 2 was picked

416: Probably, as long as there is enough distance between us. We should be far enough.

416: You have an idea, Commander?
If choice 3 was picked

416: Dye...? (Turns around) Humans, is there any dye around here?
If choice 3 was picked

Human female: There...there's some camouflage face paint...
If choice 3 was picked

416: You heard that, Commander. But what good is it going to do?

...The commander proposes a plan.

RO635: 416, any ideas yet? The military is going to catch up soon! What do we do?! We can't just conjure an Ange out of thin air!

416: RO...

416: Why can't we?

RO635: 416? What did the commander tell you? What should we do?

416: One thing I learned from 404 - no risk, no reward. I'll do anything to complete a mission.

416: Now, let's play a game.

...Meanwhile, Ange contacts the commander.

Angelia: Commander, I...

Angelia: I'm sorry. I can't think of anything...

Angelia: Yegor is only after me. If I walk outside, it'll definitely get their attention, especially when they already know something's off.

AN-94: Don't give up just yet, Ange. Their scouts are not making a move yet.

Angelia: But this time I'm really out of ideas... This is all because of me. I honestly don't know how to keep everyone alive...

Angelia: Commander, you've done your best, and I have nothing else to say. I think it's time...

Commander: Ange...
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: We've all experienced failure. Most of the time, it's not due to our own fault that we fail. You've done very well. It's me...
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: They can make it out. Yegor won't treat T-Dolls as prey. I...
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: You can't grapple with the military indefinitely. I think it's time to put an end to this. Let me...

AK-12: What the hell are you saying, Ange?

AK-12: If you give up, what are we going to do?

Angelia: The commander will take care of you. You will have better opportunities to put your skills to good use.

AN-94: But you are our charge. If we fail to protect you, then we...

Angelia: I know you'll be devastated, but you can just have your neural clouds wiped—

AK-12: Like what you did to the AR Team? You want to delete SOP-II's memories again?

AK-12: How many more times do you want to die just to make us all forget you?!

Angelia: ...

Angelia: We're out of time. Get out of here.

Angelia: Take all the combat records and the HOCs back with you... Avenge me...

Angelia: ...What? Commander? What...did you say...?

Angelia: ...There is a way?

Military Corporal: Commander, our unit in pursuit seems to have caught sight of Ange!

Yegor: What?

Military Corporal: But they're too far away; we could only capture a blurry image.

Yegor: The hair color and physique look right, but can't we get a clearer view?

Military Corporal: The readings confirm her as human. She appears to be unconscious on the back of the T-Doll from the AR Team. They've split up with the rest of the party.

Military Corporal: Ange has resumed her course and is moving stealthily, going from cover to cover, while Griffin's HOCs are circling around. They seem to be withdrawing.

Yegor: Then go after her! But send a team to keep pursuing the Griffin T-Dolls.

Yegor: Ange's condition will continue to deteriorate in the Yellow Zone, so she's planning to use the HOCs as decoys and slip away.

Military Corporal: Roger. Then what about the surveillance unit at the abandoned building?

Yegor: Hold position and keep monitoring the building. Our forces are stretched thin, but we can't have any blind spots in our surveillance.

Yegor: (...Have I considered everything?)

Yegor: (We send our main force to pursue the human we suspect to be Ange while keeping an eye on the Griffin T-Dolls. Even if Ange really is hiding in the building, the moment she tries to escape, we'll have her pinned down.)

Yegor: (There aren't any other possibilities. There's no way she can turn the situation around!)

Yegor: (I have that bitch completely cornered!)

Angelia: Commander...you mean...

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: The HOCs? There aren't that many of them. They can't possibly counter the military's main force, can they?
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: Don't escape? Then what exactly should I do?
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: So long as I can live, I don't care if I have to watch all the humans in the Military get buried alive.

Angelia: What do you have in mind?

...Ange listens to the Commander's explanation.

AK-12: You want to create roadside bombs using the HOCs' remaining artillery shells?

AN-94: That is no difficult task for T-Dolls, but the bombs will not be enough to blow up all of the Military's tanks.

Angelia: What the commander means is to rig the building with the IEDs once they're ready.

Angelia: Yegor will come sooner or later. He said he's gonna come for me and have his revenge, so these bombs will be our last bargaining chips.

AK-12: You want to blackmail them into retreating with the IEDs?

AN-94: Are you sure Yegor will come in person?

Angelia: Not at all, he isn't an impulsive man, but everyone has their impulsive moments.

Angelia: If we're making my survival a priority, this is a chance we have to take.

AN-94: But this will require the commander to lead the HOCs back here first. And even if we prepare the IEDs swiftly, we may not have long enough to rig the building.

AN-94: Installing the explosives will take some time. I highly doubt we have the skills to do it... Besides, without the artillery shells, we will not have enough firepower in the subsequent battles.

AK-12: Subsequent battles?

AN-94: Ange is not the only person still alive on the battlefield...

AK-12: Right...

Angelia: I don't wish to delay someone else's rescue, especially when my chances are so small to begin with.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: We won't give up, but if it really comes to that, I can't bear...
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: I know, but this time the odds are pretty much insurmountable.
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: Believe in you... I'm not sure, Commander. It's the military's main force we're coming up against...

AK-12: Ange...

Angelia: Fine... Commander, after so many battles, you've proved yourself to be far more capable than me.

Angelia: I believe you'll make the right decision - perhaps a better one than mine.

Angelia: If you've set your mind on executing this dangerous plan, we're going all in as well. But promise me - the moment something doesn't look right, please abort the mission and retreat.

Angelia: Do you understand, Commander? No matter what your decision is, we're happy to accept it, but don't give up hope.

Angelia: Then let's get to work, Task Force DEFY. Start preparing the IEDs while the commander buys us more time!

...Shrieks and clamor come through Yegor's communicator.

Human female voice: I'm one of your own! Don't kill me!

Human female voice: Cough...please! I was forced into this! I didn't do anything! Oh god!

Military soldier: Sir, we've captured the target that appeared to be Ange. We've confirmed that she is one of our medical personnel, given a simple makeover to resemble Ange.

Human female voice: That T-Doll knocked me out and left me here...cough... I need...cough, cough! I beg you...

Yegor: ...

Military soldier: She is infected and in need of treatment... Sir?

Yegor: Bring her back and treat her on the way.

...Yegor leans against one of the tanks and massages his brows with his fingers.

Yegor: Ange is in the building...

Yegor: She was just buying time to treat herself! FUCK!

...Yegor punches the tank in fury, then gets up and walks toward the command room.

Military soldier: Sir! The Griffin party is making a run for the building!

Yegor: They're going back to defend it! This is their last attempt to protect Ange!

Yegor: Where are the scouts? Can they enter the building before Griffin gets there?

Military soldier: They can, but the building is within the range of Griffin's HOCs. They may come under attack if they get too close!

Yegor: Then have them stand by on the spot. All combat personnel, head toward the target building and surround it!

Yegor: Ange! All those tricks are for nothing! Even if your Dolls make it back to the building, they'll just be heading to their deaths!

Yegor: This time, there'll be no escape for you!

...Ten minutes later, the rescue party returns to the building. 416 gives Ange a dose of adrenaline.

Angelia: Phew... Thanks. I'm feeling a lot better.

416: I should've recorded your scream when I stabbed you with the needle.

Angelia: Don't play it at my funeral, thanks.

Angelia: Now I can finally do some simple thinking.

AK-12: Commander, Griffin's party has returned to the building. We'll start mounting our final defenses.

AK-12: The artillery shells have been modified into IEDs. AN-94 and I are installing them as fast as we can. We'll also sort out the detonator!

Angelia: Are we really doing this? I'm seriously not sure if...

AN-94: Worst case, we all die here, but we are all prepared for that.

Angelia: SOP-II and 416 aren't...

Angelia: They have another mission - the commander... The commander is still in danger. You can't die here.

M4 SOPMOD II: Sorry, Commander's orders. I can't very well disobey them, can I?

Angelia: Commander, I don't understand. Why are you so hellbent on saving me?

...
If choice 1 was picked

Commander: I'm used to being in danger. This is just another mission.
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: In other words, you haven't realized just how important you are, have you?
If choice 1 was picked

AK-12: That's exactly why the Commander is so important, don't you think? We can't win if we never take any risks.
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: Griffin needs commanders with an eye for tactics, not an idiot like me.
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Sorry, I don't think any of us qualifies. I guess that's why we're all on the same boat?
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: This is the battlefield! It's no place to talk about personal debts! Commander, we don't owe each other anything!
If choice 3 was picked

416: Now you owe the commander one, Ange. Better start drafting your thank-you letter.

AN-94: Since it is all decided, Ange, start thinking about what we are going to do.

Angelia: ...Alright.

Angelia: Our priority is to slow the enemies down until the IEDs are all in place.

Angelia: The Military will storm the building at all costs. We must buy ourselves more time!

RO635: SOP-II, 416, the military is surrounding us in four directions!

416: Jeez...they're calling in their entire main force.

416: They've already caught on. They know Ange is in the building!

RO635: Now that I think about it, this is the first time...we're engaging the military's main force directly.

RO635: I wish...I could fight in my T-Doll body.

M4 SOPMOD II: Just take a good nap, RO.

M4 SOPMOD II: When you wake up, we'll be leaving this place with Ange!

RO635: Well, there's nothing much for me to do. I'll leave it to you then.

M4 SOPMOD II: Actually...will you stay awake, RO?

RO635: Huh? Why?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's only the AR Team when the two of us are together.

RO635: ...Suit yourself.

RO635: I'll record everything for you - the glorious battle in which the AR Team takes on the military's main force.

416: They're coming! HOCs, prepare for battle!

416: Commander, this is our last stand. We must fend off their attack and buy time for Task Force DEFY!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The military main force attacks relentlessly and is gradually dominating the battle!

416: AK-12, we can't hold them off much longer! How far off are you?!

AK-12: We're still installing them! Just hang in there for a bit!

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't know how long we can keep this up! Can't you work faster?!

RO635: SOP-II, to the left!

M4 SOPMOD II: I see it!

AN-94: We have finished installing the minimum amount of IEDs required!

AN-94: AK-12, your detonator—

RO635: 416, grenade!

...BOOM!!

AK-12: 416, what's going on?! 416!

416: I'm out of ammo! They're swarming in!

RO635: Grenade! SOP-II, duck!

...BOOM! Explosions go off one after the other.

AK-12: 416! SOP-II! What's happening out there?! Answer me!

AK-12: 416! Do you copy?!

416: They've breached our defenses! Yegor has entered the building!

416: We must get them off our tail fast!

AN-94: AK-12, where is the detonator?!

AK-12: We're not gonna make it...

AN-94: What...?

AK-12: Now that the enemies are inside the building, I can't wire them all together!

AK-12: It's simply impossible to set up all the IEDs within such a limited amount of time!

AN-94: ...Is it impossible?

AN-94: We are...so close...

AK-12: We've come so far... Ange, is it really over...just like that?

AN-94: Ange...what should we do now? Is there a backup plan...?

Angelia: ...

AK-12: ...Ange?

416: SOP-II, keep up! Those trip mines won't hold them off for long!

416: AK-12, are the bombs ready yet?!

416: AK-12?! AN-94?! Scheiße! Somebody answer me!

The very air grows still. The sound of crossfire is getting closer and closer.

Ange raises her head slowly.

Angelia: Give me another dose of adrenaline.

AN-94: But in its current condition, your body cannot...

Angelia: Give me another dose of adrenaline.

AK-12: ...94, give it to her.

Ange lets out a painful groan as she injects herself with more adrenaline.

Angelia: (Pants)

Beads of sweat are rolling down her forehead. She keeps breathing laboriously to drown out the pain.

Angelia: Here's the plan - take everyone to the roof and stay as far away from me as you can.

AK-12: You want us to retreat without you?

AK-12: Sorry, we can't do that. Yegor's forces already have this place completely surrounded.

Angelia: Of course I know that. That's why I'm giving such an order.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 looks Ange in the eye and finds no hesitation in her steady gaze.

AK-12: I see. Then good luck.

AK-12: 94, tell SOP-II and 416 to retreat to the roof. We'll meet them there.

AN-94: But Ange...

AK-12: Ange is going to sort this out her own way.

AN-94: Understood. I will notify them.

AK-12: Ange, how sure are you about this?

Angelia: There's a 10% chance that this will work, maybe less.

AK-12: Optimistic as ever, I see.

Angelia: If it does work, try to get me out as fast as you can.

AK-12: Understood. I'll be waiting for your order.

AK-12 and AN-94 take their leave.

Ange picks up the detonator that AK-12 didn't manage to set up. She grabs an old chair and sits down slowly.

She fishes out the pistol AK-12 handed back to her and snickers to herself.

Angelia: If I'd known, I wouldn't have emptied the mag back then. I could've blown Yegor's damn brains out now.

...Footsteps coming from downstairs.

Military soldier: There's a sound. The bio signature is just upstairs.

Military soldier: The T-Dolls' signals are further up - on the roof, a considerable distance away from the bio signature...

Military soldier: Could this be a trap?

Yegor: Attention, our target is on the third floor. Hold your positions and stay alert.

Yegor: Let me see what she's up to.

Military soldier: Sir, are you going up alone?

Yegor: She's provoking me...which is why I must end her myself.

Yegor: The T-Dolls aren't by her side; she must've prepared something. Check the building carefully and report to me at once if you find anything.

Military soldier: Yes, sir.

Yegor: Now let's see what kind of tricks you've still got with one foot already in your coffin, Ange.

...Yegor walks up the stairs. Finally, he is face-to-face with the woman.

Yegor: Angelia.

Angelia: Captain Yegor.

Angelia: We meet again.

Yegor: You don't have your subordinates with you.

Angelia: Neither do you.

Yegor: I am more than enough to deal with you.

Angelia: You talk big for a guy who made a huge fuss and dragged an entire crowd along to pursue me. That's a rather pathetic way of chasing women.

Yegor: Are these your last words? You're even more boring than I thought. Ange, you really disappoint me.

Angelia: Sorry, I really am just a boring woman.

Angelia: So, are you planning to make a lengthy speech before you kill me?

Yegor: Do I look like a second-rate villain in some trashy movie?

Angelia: You look like one, but I know your head isn't clear enough for the part anymore...

Angelia: Collapse Fluid doesn't just ravage the flesh. You've been enduring the mental instability caused by the radiation while letting me play you for a fool. You must be very close to losing it.

Yegor: You're right. My subordinates and I were a bit out of control because ever since the dirty bomb went off, we've been driven by a single motive - to kill you!

Yegor: The puppet show you put on with your Griffin Dolls hasn't quenched our thirst for vengeance in the slightest, as there is only one thing we're after - your death. Now, it's time!

...Ange gives no response, but Yegor notices her obscured hand making a move.

Yegor: Die!

Yegor pulls out his gun, but at the same time...

Angelia: That fast draw was beautiful. If you weren't an enemy, I might just fall for you.

Yegor: ...!

Angelia: But why haven't you fired?

Angelia: If I'm not mistaken, you seem to be afraid of this?

Ange lifts the detonator.

Angelia: Barging into the building in such a hurry. You didn't even think about why I'd been staying here, did you?

Right then, Yegor receives a transmission.

Military soldier: Sir, we've discovered multiple IEDs hidden around the building!

Military soldier: We only located a few with our scan, but judging by the rigging pattern, we estimate there are a lot more that we haven't picked up yet!

Angelia: Finally caught on? That's right, I put on an act and fooled you into thinking I was extremely weak and feeble, so that you'd have this building surrounded. Then I had my T-Dolls buy time for me to prepare the bombs and just waited for you to come bursting into the building like an idiot.

Angelia: It has always been my plan to get you all in one go and make you pay for betraying me.

Yegor: An...ge...!

Angelia: Oh, don't look at me like that. And I suggest you relax your hand. If you shoot me, my T-Dolls will immediately set off the bombs with the spare detonator.

Yegor: You think you can threaten me?!

Angelia: Of course I can.

Angelia: One last thing - these aren't just regular bombs in the building. They're rigged to a Collapse Fluid canister. If it goes off, all your forces out there will be going down with us.

Yegor: ...Collapse Fluid? Trying to trick me again even now? Cut the crap! You have no way of doing that!

Angelia: What makes you so sure?

Yegor: You're lying! Where can you get so much Collapse Fluid? There can't be more canisters!

Angelia: Why not? Just because I've used one before?

Angelia: Who do you think is more likely to press the detonator - a person who's set off a nuclear bomb or one who hasn't?

Angelia: Why don't you ask your subordinates? They must be busy trying to find the little present we've hidden for you.

Yegor keeps one hand on his gun and fishes out his communicator with the other.

Yegor: Are you detecting a high concentration of Collapse Fluid in the building?

Military soldier: We heard her. We're running a scan right now.

Military soldier: But the contamination is so severe in the area the scanner can't get a proper reading.

Yegor: ...

Angelia: Well? Believe me now?

Yegor: Then what are you waiting for? Push the trigger as you've planned!

Angelia: Hahaha...!

Yegor: What's so funny...?

Angelia: You. You're on the verge of collapsing under all this pressure, but you're still trying to pressure ME.

Angelia: Not bad. I'll give you some good news - you're in luck; I just changed my mind.

Angelia: Order your troops outside to withdraw to the outskirts and let me - and all my T-Dolls - leave this place.

Angelia: Then I'll think about letting you all off the hook.

Yegor: You wish, Ange! I've finally made it this far, I won't just let you slip away again!

Yegor: Push that trigger and let's go to hell together if you dare!

Angelia: Don't try me! This is your final chance!

Angelia: Or you'll take another radiation bath! But this time, neither you nor your subordinates will survive!

Yegor: You think I'm scared of dying here? We're soldiers, Ange! And you know what soldiers are made of!

Angelia: I know you, Yegor - you're their commanding officer!

Angelia: You may consider T-Dolls worthless, but these humans are your comrades and brothers! Will you endanger them again just so you can have your revenge?

Yegor: My men...don't mind making sacrifices!

Angelia: So you want them to eat another dirty bomb?! Just how selfish can you be?! Think about their future! Think about their families! The moment I use this detonator, you, as well as everyone here, won't ever get a chance to have your revenge!

Yegor: You're bluffing! Either that, or you're fucking insane!

Angelia: I am! That's why I'm capable of anything! They have all left me for dead and this is my last lifeline!

Angelia: I'm not afraid of anything! I'm happy to trade my own life and my worthless T-Dolls in exchange for bringing down so many enemies!

Angelia: ...No matter what you do, I win.

Angelia: So...take your pick. Either we all live...or you're all coming with me!

...Ange grins wolfishly. Yegor can't discern any ulterior motive from her cold eyes. She is only forcing him to do one thing...to make a choice.

...Yegor knows that at this point, he really doesn't have one.

...Slowly, he lays down his weapon.

Yegor: ...

Yegor: This time, you win.

Yegor: I'll spare your worthless life for now.

Yegor: Attention, this building is suspected to be rigged with explosives containing Collapse Fluid. Withdraw three kilometers and keep a safe distance from this structure. That's an order - everyone out, NOW!

...Ange stands up and walks slowly toward the window.

AK-12: Ange, do you copy? The Military is starting to withdraw. Our path to the extraction point is clear!

Angelia: I know. Come and get me.

She turns back to Yegor.

Angelia: You make a fine commanding officer. I'll admit you're a good soldier, but you're fighting on the wrong side.

AK-12 and AN-94 jump in through the window and aim their weapons at Yegor.

Yegor: So you're getting rid of me after all.

Angelia: Kill you? There's nothing in it for me.

Angelia: The Sangvis mastermind has given us the slip. Is there any reason why we must tear each other's throats out?

Yegor: You know I have a reason.

Angelia: I once had a million reasons to kill you, too.

Angelia: But not now. I've got more important stuff to do.

Yegor: This isn't the end, Angelia...

Yegor: ...Just you wait.

...Ange lets herself be pulled onto AK-12's back under Yegor's vicious glare.

Angelia: Leave it till next time. Here, a little souvenir for you. I hope it'll help you remember a hard lesson learned.

Ange tosses the detonator onto the floor as AK-12 and AN-94 jump out through the window with her.

Yegor walks steadily toward the window and picks up the detonator. He stares wordlessly at the empty sky outside.

...Half an hour later.

Military soldier: Sir, according to the bomb disposal unit's report, the IEDs installed in the building...weren't connected to any detonator...

Military soldier: The drone has run a detailed scan on the whole structure and found no sign of any canister containing a high concentration of Collapse Fluid either...

Yegor: ...

Military soldier: Sir...

Yegor: I knew it... I knew it...

...Yegor remains incredibly calm. He merely gazes emptily at the detonator Ange left behind.

Yegor: I knew she was bluffing...

Yegor: It wasn't unexpected at all...

Yegor: But I had no choice. You all know what that woman is capable of. I couldn't put your lives in danger again.

Military soldier: Sir...

Military soldier: Next time, no matter what happens, we are ready to sacrifice ourselves at your command.

Yegor peers at the corporal. He takes a deep breath and claps his subordinate on the shoulder.

Yegor: Save that for our next operation. Our country will demand greater sacrifices from us all.

Yegor: For the country's bright future, we must proceed to the next stage of the plan...

...Meanwhile.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange! I didn't know you threw in some Collapse Fluid! But what actually is Collapse Fluid?

Angelia: Haha...as if. I had no more cards up my sleeve back then; all I could do was give them a scare.

Angelia: I knew Yegor would be suspicious when he saw me on my own. I merely stoked his suspicions and made him scare the pants off himself.

AK-12: That was real dirty.

Angelia: If I didn't strike him where it hurt, I couldn't have shaken his resolve.

Angelia: He isn't afraid to die, but he can't bear to watch so many of his men die before him. It wasn't the first time...

416: Ange, I'm curious - if the IEDs were fully functional, would you really have detonated them?

Angelia: ...I don't know. We'll see if it ever comes to that. I'll improvise.

AK-12: You always devise very elaborate plans with provisions made for various contingencies, yet now you talk about improvising.

AK-12: I mean, I don't mind winging it when something unexpected happens, but you really went off the deep end this time - even I think so.

Angelia: To be honest, it was all empty bravado. I banked everything on three things - one, the Military couldn't find all of the IEDs that quickly; two, the radiation had spread enough to affect the entire area and interfere with their scanner; and three, Yegor was befuddled by my high-pressure tactics...

Angelia: The result...was mostly down to luck. If Yegor hadn't been infected, if he hadn't been so impatient to have his revenge, with his experience, he could most certainly have come up with something else, and my hands would've been truly tied...

AN-94: But in the end, we did survive - that's what truly matters. You saved us, Ange.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, I didn't actually expect all of us to live!

Angelia: I'm the one who's saved; you just got dragged into this because of me.

Angelia: I'm very grateful to you all and the commander...

RO635: Now we're going to rescue the commander, aren't we?

AK-12: Hmm... The military has resumed their pursuit.

AN-94: They are currently occupied with cleaning up the scene and treating their wounded. This is our best chance.

M4 SOPMOD II: Thank goodness you haven't been in any kind of danger so far, Commander. You managed to stay hidden in the secret safe house this whole time - how lucky!

...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Help?
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: See? But aren't you bored having been on your own for so long?
If choice 2 was picked

416: The commander does have company. They aren't together, but they can still chat.
If choice 3 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha! Sorry, but you're so well hidden I doubt there could be any threat.
If choice 3 was picked

416: Rather, they have neutralized all the threats.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh? Who do you mean?

416: The two elite T-Dolls Fräulein Kalin sent to protect the commander.

RO635: She only sent...two?

416: We're understaffed, but those two are more than enough for the job.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? I'm not sure about that. Who are they?

416: One is an elite model that IOP has kept under wraps for a long time. She isn't exactly a team player, but she's good.

416: Her name is...

M82A1: Griffin T-Doll M82A1.

The sound of a ferocious shootout comes through the channel.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Is there a fight somewhere?

M82A1: I've been fighting the whole time.

M82A1: Kalina told me a rescue party was on their way, but I didn't know you'd take so long. The commander is in trouble. Please hurry up.

Angelia: Trouble? What trouble?

...Bang!

M870: Gunshot! They're coming, bearing 300°!

M82A1: I heard that too, thank you very much. Don't interrupt me.

M82A1: Allow me to introduce M870 - a problematic T-Doll that's good for nothing if not for her skills.

M870: "Good for nothing if not for her skills and COOLNESS", thank you very much!

M870: Nice to meet you, guys, but I'm not interested in going out for drinks with strangers under such dangerous circumstances!

M870: Right now, there are only the two of us protecting the commander, so can you please hurry the fuck up?!

AK-12: What enemies have you run into? Can you describe them?

M82A1: I've been trying to figure that out myself. These things we're coming up against...

M82A1: What exactly are they...? T-Dolls? ...Humans? Or...some sort of "emissaries"?

M870: I'm not sure if I can take care of them!

M870: Just to make it clear, girls - you do understand that by "I'm not sure", I actually mean "I can't", right?

AK-12: Now we do. But what kind of enemies are we talking about?

M82A1: I don't know what they are.

M82A1: Have you seen these white Dolls before?

M870: And...that kinky slut wearing a white tunic over there?

416: ...

Angelia: What...white Dolls?

416: We really must hurry.

416: Commander, we're in big trouble!

...The night is over and the sky starts turning a pinkish white. Everyone is making their final preparations for the decisive battle.

Angelia: New enemies?! Why didn't you mention anything?!

416: Our mission so far didn't have use for such information!

416: Have you got any clue, Ange?

Angelia: No...but I might be able to make a guess going by their characteristics. What do they look like?

M4 SOPMOD II: You'll see for yourself soon.

AN-94: Making all those bombs just now has weakened our HOCs' firepower significantly.

AN-94: If they use up all the remaining artillery shells now, our next move...

Angelia: Use them all. Save nothing. This is our last move.

Angelia: Commander, how are you doing?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, of course we are! You're our Commander!
If choice 1 was picked

RO635: Even though I'm stuck in this form...I'll still do my best for you!
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, you've helped us out so many times. This time, let us save you!
If choice 1 was picked

RO635: Please hang in there, Commander!
If choice 2 was picked

416: Of course I have. This is me we're talking about, Commander. You should have complete faith in me.

416: That also applies to this mission to rescue you.
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: Commander, I honestly didn't expect such persistence from you. Are you doing this just because it's your job? Or do you sincerely like it in Griffin?

Angelia: Whatever the case, I WILL repay you. Of course, rescuing you this time won't be enough, but it's a start.
If choice 3 was picked

AK-12: Can't be helped. Ange's orders.

AK-12: Just kidding. You've helped us and Ange out so many times. We should do something to return the favor.
If choice 3 was picked

AN-94: Besides, this operation requires a triumphant conclusion.

AN-94: It is our honor to see everything through to the end.

Angelia: Right, girls. While not everyone is here, almost all the subordinates I've ever had are with me now.

Angelia: I've looked through 416's report. These enemies are powerful and enigmatic, but they have only one objective - to capture the commander.

Angelia: We will NOT let them get what they want. The commander's team will do their best to slow them down, while we'll break through their encirclement and extract the commander from the safe house...

AK-12: Have you seen these stats, Ange? This is gonna be a very tough fight.

416: The black Doll alone almost turned the entire Griffin base upside down, and this white one could only be even more advanced!

Angelia: I know. My experience tells me our chances aren't good at all.

Angelia: But they never are, are they? In any case, the commander needs us now.

Angelia: We MUST succeed and achieve this one last victory for the commander! Let's go!

White Doll: Good morning, Griffin Commander.

White Doll: Do not resist or we will destroy all your subordinates.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

White Doll: If we fail, we die. Since we cannot die, we will succeed.
If choice 2 was picked

White Doll: I perceive no fear in your voice. Are you deceiving me?
If choice 3 was picked

White Doll: Yes, we wish to observe your reactions and compare them to the data we have in your profile.

White Doll: Subject did not react in despair. Supposition inaccurate.

White Doll: Further observation to be conducted after the subject is captured.

Angelia: We won't let you, puppet! We're going to break through your blockade and rescue the commander!

White Doll: All your efforts are futile.

White Doll: Since you will not lay down your arms, I will prove that to you soon.

White Doll: Now, Nytos, let the hunt begin!
Part 2

2

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange! Now!

Angelia: Not yet! Enemy fire is still too heavy!

Angelia: 416, these Ringleaders are totally different than what your information describes!

416: These must be enhanced models! They're even more powerful than the previous ones!

AK-12: I'm dying to know where they came from... What the hell are they?!

AN-94: I have never seen that insignia or those weapons before.

Angelia: We must fall back and wait for another chance!

RO635: How long will it take...? They seem to be getting reinforcements!

M82A1: Can you still go on?

Angelia: ...I don't know, M82. If it weren't for your long-range support, we would probably die right here.

M82A1: I don't want that to happen. If you can help me pinpoint the Ringleader's precise location, I might be able to snipe her down from this angle.

Angelia: Got it... I'll try to think of a way out of this impasse...
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...The battle enters the final stage.

416: Commander, we've eliminated the enemies in the perimeter! We're looking for a chance to make our way in!

416: Please be ready. We'll be right—

The transmission gets cut off all of a sudden!

...Crash! The back door of the safe house is broken down!

The commander feels an abrupt sting of electric current from head to toe and slumps onto the ground.

Black Doll: Good morning, Griffin Commander.

Black Doll: We are under orders to capture you...

...Smack!

Suddenly, a figure comes rushing up from behind the black Doll and slaps her across the face with a force way more incredible than it appears.

The Doll flies across a considerable distance and slams into the wall...

White Doll: That was for walking in front of me.

The black Doll gets to her feet slowly, red fluid dripping down the corner of her mouth.

...Smack!

White Doll: That was for your stupidity that resulted in a failed mission.

White Doll: There were only a few Dolls at the Griffin base, yet you still failed. You also wasted quadruple the amount of time and five times more resources than expected on gathering and analyzing their data.

Black Doll: That...was not me...

Black Doll: They...have already given their all...

White Nyto: To me, you are all the same, and you keep making the same mistake mission after mission.

White Nyto: Our lives are short and precious, yet you squander them time and time again with your impotence. I am ashamed to share your name and appearance. Father should never have created you.

White Nyto: This is why I am standing here, teaching you what it means to have a "self".

Black Nyto: I...understand...

White Nyto: Our success today is all thanks to me. That human is my trophy.

Black Nyto: I...have no objection...

White Nyto: Take the human to Father's desired location...

White Nyto: And the "we" over there will acquire what Father wants from the prisoner.

White Nyto: Griffin is about to break through our blockade. When will our transport arrive?

Black Nyto: It is going to take some time. The automated carrier is still on its way— Sister, where are you going?

White Nyto: This is a demonstration. I'm going to buy you some time.

Black Nyto: But you will not get to leave. Your soul will not stay anchored to this body.

White Nyto: Genuine freedom can only be attained through sacrifice. I shall "awaken" once more with this freedom.

White Nyto: Take the human and report my achievements to Father. Do you understand?

Black Nyto: Yes, I will make sure Father remembers you...I swear.

...Ten minutes later.

AK-12: Their defense line is about to collapse! Keep it up!

White Nyto: Your actions are meaningless, Griffin Dolls.

White Nyto: No matter how many times you attack, you will not be able to get close to my scythe.

AN-94: We know we can't...

AN-94: But they can.

...

Terrifying howl: GUARGHHHHHHH!

White Nyto: The Baptized?

M4 SOPMOD II: Guys, RO and I have drawn the ELID zombies this way!

RO635: I told you I'd come in handy!

M4 SOPMOD II: Humph, you mean your megaphone. I didn't know it comes with so many modes!

RO635: I am a T-Doll of many talents!

RO635: Hey, hurry! They're about to get me!

AN-94: SOP-II, you might have attracted too many of them.

M4 SOPMOD II: Didn't you say to draw them all from every direction?

...The ELIDs surge towards the blockade.

White Nyto: All units, stand down. Do not attack the Baptized.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Why aren't the white enemies attacking? They'll be torn to pieces!

AK-12: Does that matter? M82, I've located the target. Can you make a snipe from this distance?

M82A1: Wouldn't be a problem even if you tripled the distance.

...Bang!

...The white Doll takes a bullet in the head, which explodes like a watermelon.

AK-12: We did our part.

AK-12: Now...it's up to Ange and 416.

...Meanwhile, inside the safe house.

...Bam! 416 kicks the door open.

416: Commander! Where are you? Come out!

Angelia: The Commander isn't here! Search the house!

Black Nyto: Do not bother.

Black Nyto: You are too late.

...The black Doll walks slowly into the room.

Angelia: Why...why are you here?!

Angelia: What about the Commander? Tell us where the Commander is!

Black Nyto: We have taken the Griffin Commander away.

416: ...

416: Why...?

416: What exactly are you after?!

Black Nyto: You...know nothing about "us"...

Black Nyto: "Our" greatness is beyond your comprehension.

416: What...?

Angelia: You must be here for a reason. You couldn't possibly have fallen out from the sky...

Black Nyto: What do you hope to achieve with that piece of knowledge?

Angelia: Indeed, I have no interest in your identity or intentions. Hand the commander over!

Black Nyto: Unfortunately, the human has already departed from this location.

Black Nyto: There is nothing you can do.

Black Nyto: I only stayed behind to relay a message.

Black Nyto: "The shining beacon in a brave new world."

...Bang!

...Ange kills the black Doll with a single shot.

Angelia: Don't say that in my presence. It revolts me.

AK-12: Ange, the battlefield is getting out of hand! We must withdraw!

AN-94: Can you confirm if the commander...has really been abducted?

416: There are no life signs in the safe house. I believe it's true...

RO635: Those white Dolls...were only here to slow us down.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange...

M4 SOPMOD II: Did we fail the mission...?

...Ange stares at the remains of the black Doll and the pool of crimson fluid on the floor in silence.

Angelia: No, not yet...

Angelia: We simply...haven't completed the mission yet.

Angelia: No one is going to get left behind, I swear.

Angelia: ...

...

I think I finished the entire story. I'm sure I didn't make any mistakes.

A heavy weight is lifted off my mind - I no longer have to fight against the truth serum. Of course, this also means I'm about to face something much worse...

Nyto: ...Father.

Nyto: The Griffin Commander has completed the statement. It tallies with our information.

Distorted voice: Finally spilled it all?

Distorted voice: It took you so long to interrogate a simple PMC employee. Just how useless are you?

Nyto: We are very sorry, Father. We did our best.

Distorted voice: I know. I never expected much from garbage like you. Now tell me what you learned. Keep it brief.

Calm T-Doll's voice: ...Commander.

Just then, I hear a voice in my ear. I hear hope.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Please check your restraints discreetly, but don't make a move. We've hacked into the system and deactivated them.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Once you confirm this, feel around for the pistol hidden beneath the straps. If you can find it, please lower your gaze, look to the right, and blink twice. Then look straight ahead again.

I can feel that the restraints have indeed been deactivated and I follow her instructions.

I can now move freely, but I know it isn't time yet.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Understood, Commander. We'll be there in the interrogation room right away.

Calm T-Doll's voice: If these Nytos try to attack you before we get there, don't hesitate to fight back. They're only interrogator models and have no weapons or combat capabilities. I'm sure you can handle them.

Calm T-Doll's voice: By the way, don't forget our code. To acknowledge, please lift your gaze, look to the left, furrow your brows, then pull the right corner of your mouth downward. Oh, and stick out your tongue.

It's a bit challenging, but I do everything she asks...

Calm T-Doll's voice: A wonderful face. I've documented the image in retaliation for ruining my reputation in your story.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Now, please wait patiently. We still need a little bit more time.

I want to tell her I don't have much time left, but she's already ended the conversation.

On the other end of the Nyto's communicator, the owner of that male voice whose haughtiness is so apparent even through the digital distortion that he must be lying on a sofa right now, listening to a record player and staring at the ceiling. Then he'll casually read out my sentence.

What awaits me...what this "Father" wants to do to me...is quite obvious...

Distorted voice: ...So you're telling me, that there was no way for the Commander and all the other targets to have come into contact with Mastermind?

Nyto: Indeed. The evidence offers no contradiction from any aspect.

Distorted voice: Then we have no need for contradiction. Your work is over.

Nyto: What should we do with the commander?

Distorted voice: Do you have to ask? How many times have you done this already?

Distorted voice: Chop off the Commander's head and send it to me. Then destroy all evidence.

Distorted voice: Stand closer this time and put your back into the swing. Make it a clean cut and keep the head in good shape for my research.

Will my rescue not make it in time? The four Nytos are closing in with blades in hand!

I'm not sure other than the head, what other body parts would make effective targets. I must wait for them to come even closer so that I can get them all in the head in one go.

Commander:

Commander:

The four Dolls offer no response at all. They just keep walking towards me.

No...I can't make a move yet. They're not close enough. Just a bit closer!

Besides...I don't know which one...

The moment the Nytos raise their blades—

??: "I've brought misfortune."

...Bang! Bang, bang!

...

I aim my pistol at the last standing Nyto.

She gazes at me, but I don't pull the trigger because...

Commander: My motto has always been "treat ladies gently".

Nyto?: I told you you didn't have to respond to my code phrase.

Nyto?: But I like that reply. Looks like you know who we are.

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto under UMP45's control: I'm very honored to take part in this mission, Commander.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto under UMP45's control: 416 is with me. Gr G11 and 9 are giving us off-site support. Don't worry, we'll get you out.
If choice 1 was picked

Somehow I doubt your sincerity.
If choice 2 was picked

I'm relieved to hear that. I suppose I can at least trust you as allies.

Nyto under UMP45's control: I would very much like to smile in response to that, but simply hacking into this Nyto is taking up all my processing capacity.

Nyto under UMP45's control: I can't do much about the face or the voice. Hope you don't mind.

The Nyto walks toward the entrance and studies the door.

Nyto under UMP45's control: They seem to take you very seriously. To keep this interrogation room under wraps, the door can only be opened from within, and the only ones with access are these Nytos.

Nyto under UMP45's control: Of course, we could've blasted it open from outside, but I didn't want to blow you to bits as well.

The Nyto fiddles with some mechanism, and the door opens with a creak.

Then a T-Doll walks in.

416: ...Looks like you're safe, Commander.

The calm T-Doll that has been corresponding with me was 416. Then the one in control of the Nyto...

UMP45: Nicely done, Commander.

UMP45: You managed to finish off three Nytos all by yourself under these circumstances.

UMP45: Now, let me add the finishing touch.

UMP45 executes the hacked Nyto with a bang.

UMP45: Your suffering is over.

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

UMP45: Like my new look? I don't think you get to see me too often.
If choice 1 was picked

416: Just give her some compliments. Who knows when we'll see each other again.
If choice 1 was picked

UMP45: The next time we meet, you'll probably have forgotten about me, or you won't dare remember me.

UMP45: But I'll be happy so long as you remember our secret code. Now, let's get on with the job.
If choice 2 was picked

416: We've kept you waiting, Commander. Can you still move?

416: Your stories were a bit over-the-top, but you didn't deserve such punishment...
If choice 2 was picked

416 walks up to me and looks a bit concerned. Either my mind is starting to get foggy, or the punishment really was that heavy...

UMP45: 416, hold the Commander up. We're getting out of here.

416: That's not going to be easy. Are they coming, 45?

UMP45: Of course. They won't give up the Commander just like that. Let's go! We should find somewhere to hide first!

...With the help of a brand new UMP45 and the same old 416, I stumble out of the interrogation room unsteadily.

At long last, I'm leaving this damn place, where I've spent god-knows-how many hours or days. But I can't help but look back at the remains of the Nytos in there...

...Remains? Or...?

I take in the fluid that looks exactly like blood and the body parts mangled by bullets.

What on earth...are "they"?

With my brain still addled by chemicals, all kinds of notions tumble around uncontrollably inside my head.

UMP45's hack could only last for a minute at a time?

RO mentioned something about fluid leaking out of their bodies after they got shot...?

And the voice that sounded both real and hollow...

I can't think straight. The sounds of gunshots, artillery fire, and UMP45's calls overlap in my mind as I gradually slip into oblivion...

What exactly have I achieved? Victory? Freedom? Or...an even deeper level of hell?

...The operation has dragged on for too long and the infection has spread all over Ange's body. Task Force DEFY is forced to abort the mission and make a swift escape.

AN-94: The contamination index in this area is falling! There must be a safe spot ahead!

AK-12: Hurry, Ange! Keep running! We're almost there!

...Heading towards something. That's what Ange has been doing all along.

AK-12: Ange?

...But she has never felt so lost before.

AN-94: Ange...

...Confusion, terror, hate. At the last moment...

...She lets go of all these things that she's been holding onto, so that she can get the one thing she wants right now.

Ange...

Angelia: GUARGHHHHHHH!!

...Death.

AK-12: Ange...

AK-12: I can't do this...

AN-94: Didn't you hear her, AK-12?

AN-94: She wants us...to kill her.

...

Angelia: Ugh...argh...

Angelia: GUARGHHHHH!!

AN-94: This is our final order. Come on.

...Bang, bang!

...Half an hour later, at a certain communications outpost.

AK-12: Commander, Ange's radiation sickness escalated and became rampant. We obeyed her dying wish and put her down.

AK-12: The rescue mission has ended in failure. AN-94 and I will bury Ange's body and self-destruct in 15 minutes.

AK-12: Please...withdraw the rescue party and leave the battlefield as soon as you can.

...End of transmission.

...Not another sound comes through the communicator...

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...

...In the end, the defensive battle didn't buy enough time, and Task Force DEFY couldn't finish installing the IEDs within the time limit.

The commander is forced to abort the mission and instructs the rescue party to withdraw before the military breaches the structure.

Yegor later enters the building...and finds Angelia.

Yegor: Angelia, you've been pulling off trick after trick.

Yegor: I'm fully prepared for that, but I still feel compelled to applaud your resourcefulness.

Yegor: Sadly, our game of hide-and-seek has still come to an end...

Angelia: I knew you'd come.

Angelia: But I didn't expect you to come alone.

Yegor: I know that nothing poses a threat to me in this building. I'm just here to kill you. I don't need help for that.

Angelia: I still have two T-Dolls with me, Yegor. You shouldn't throw your own life away so easily. We all want to kill you very much.

Yegor: Thanks to your dirty bomb, I will be court-martialed even if I return to the Military. My subordinates will finish what I started.

Yegor: You know, if I die here, at least I'll still be a hero.

Angelia: You're not a hero, Yegor. Never.

Yegor: I am what history says I am...

Yegor: History is written by the victors!

Yegor: And we WILL be the victors!

...Yegor raises his pistol.

Angelia: Yegor...

Angelia: You don't even know...what victory really is.

Angelia: You'll never know what it costs to win!

Yegor: The cost of victory...is to become history!

...Bang!

...Bang, bang, bang!

...Meanwhile.

416: Commander...

416: The Military forces laying siege just destroyed the building.

416: According to the communication logs, Yegor killed Ange, then he was slain by Task Force DEFY.

416: After that, the Military forces received orders to demolish the building. No sign of survival from Task Force DEFY.

416: Our mission is over, Commander.

416: We will reach our set course in ten minutes. Then we will be on our way to rescue you.

416: At least let us do that and complete this one last mission...

...

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...

You crossed the line, even if everything you did was to stop them.

There is a saying in the Orient, "You can't seize the tiger's cubs unless you go into the tiger's den."

Do you know how many members of the Committee are keeping quiet?

At least you could have waited until the International Alliance Agreement was signed.

Once Pandora's Box is opened, hostility and distrust will become new plagues.

If this hatred continues to exist, how can you become "the shining beacon in a brave new world??"

...They made contact with you as well. You do know that I can arrest you just for that.

We all know what comes after the alliance, and you approve of their ideals too. You simply can't say or do anything.

...

So leave the talking to those who can talk and leave the doing to those who can do something. This is exactly why we need them.

This is only a beginning. Progress always demands a price, and fearing the price will only lead us to a worse future.

We need to wait for "her" to make a choice. We will need to be patient until everything has an "answer".

...At an unknown time.

??: M4A1...

??: Everything needs an explanation, an answer, a conclusion and the truth.

M4A1: I won't obey your orders.

??: Your only order...is to find and explain the reason for your existence.

??: I will help you, because we are one. This is a fact, M4A1. Are you ready to start?

M4A1: I will never be ready, but I will find them, be it Mastermind or M16A1...

M4A1: I will accept the outcome, whatever it may be, and if necessary...

M4A1: ...I will bring it to fruition myself.

No matter what becomes of this world, all we have is our bonds.

No matter how far apart we are, I know we can only count on those Dolls or humans who believe in us.

I behold a future of bewildering chaos, but I believe this is the only order worth clinging to...

And when the time comes for me to face the truth, I must either possess it...or destroy it...
