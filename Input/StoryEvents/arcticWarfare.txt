About 40 days after the operation in Area S05...

The AR Team is on an aircraft returning from a visit to M4A1...

M4 SOPMOD II: M16...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, M16.

M16A1: ...

M16A1: What?

M4 SOPMOD II: M4A1...

M4 SOPMOD II: What in the world happened to her...?

M16A1: Well...

M16A1: (Sighs)

M16A1: According to Persica, her neural cloud is damaged and her Imprint severed...

M16A1: Even though the neural cloud has now been repaired, the Imprint link still needs to be re-established. Until then, she won't even be able to hold a weapon properly...

M4 SOPMOD II: How could that be... I've never heard of such things...

RO635: Well... Don't despair yet.

RO635: As the tech provider for T-Dolls, I'm sure 16Lab will be able to get M4 back to how she was.

RO635: What we need to do for now...is to get back into top form ourselves and wait for her to come back...

M16A1: You're right... Let's take a good rest once we're back at the base and wait for our next assignment.

M4 SOPMOD II: I hope it's gonna be a full-scale counterattack. It's been ages since my last proper fight - I'm itching for a good one.

M16A1: Humph. Didn't you tear some Sangvis mobs to shreds just days ago...?

M4 SOPMOD II: I have no memory of that, so it doesn't count.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm gonna remember everything clearly next time!

...Click.

M16A1: Tsk...

RO635: What is it, M16?

M16A1: A transmission from Helian.

M16A1: An urgent one at that...

M16A1: RO, you'd better...

RO635: (Nods)

Helian: M16, are you guys still on the aircraft?!

M16A1: Uh, yeah...

M16A1: ETA in three hours...

Helian: Change your course immediately according to Plan C!

Helian: Area S03, where you're flying over right now, has suddenly come under the attack of numerous Jupiter cannons!

Helian: A freighter plane was destroyed in the area just three minutes ago! You must find a way to steer clear of that airspace, do you copy?!

M16A1: Got it! Adjusting the course right now! We'll be...

BOOM!

M16A1: Hey! What happened?!

M4 SOPMOD : We're hit!

M16A1: Dammit!

M16A1: Miss Helian! Do you copy?! The rudder of our plane got scraped by a shell!

M16A1: I've already sent out a distress signal. Please mount a rescue immediately, Miss Helian!

M16A1: Tsk, comms are down. We're losing altitude!

M16A1: Hold on tight! Don't let go!

...

......

M4A1: M16.

M4A1: Wake up, M16.

M16A1: M4?

M16A1: Is that you?

M16A1: How come you're here?

M4A1: Is that strange?

M4A1: Open your eyes and look at me...

M4A1: Haven't you...been asking to see me?

M16A1: ...?!

M16A1: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: M16? Are you okay?

M16A1: ...

M16A1: I'm...fine...

M16A1: Did you kill these Sangvis units for me?

M4 SOPMOD II: Just mobs attracted by the noise. Piece of cake.

M4 SOPMOD II: Is your neural cloud stable? Just now you looked a bit...

M16A1: Phew...

M16A1: Thanks, SOP II. I'm okay.

RO635: You sure, M16?

M16A1: (Stands up) Positive.

M16A1: What's our status?

RO635: Not good. I'm afraid we've crashed into the heart of Sangvis territory.

RO635: We'd better leave this place as soon as possible before we're detected.

M16A1: True. You have full command, RO.

RO635: But...I can't compare with M4 in terms of experience in dealing with emergencies...

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't worry. You have our experience to work with. Now get us outta here!!

RO635: Understood. Please lend me your strength.

RO635: We only have one single objective - leave this place safely.

RO635: We can't do this on our own. I'll need you to get in touch with Helian and get a rescue plan from her, M16.

M16A1: But the weather conditions are terrible right now and the signal isn't too stable.

M16A1: We have to find a communication outpost first.

M4 SOPMOD II: Not only is the signal weak, we're also freezing to death, and we're running low on rations...

M4 SOPMOD II: There's snow everywhere and we can't see a thing...

RO635: Let's find somewhere with a clearer view first so that I can study the terrain and come up with a plan.

RO635: Move carefully. This area has been occupied by S.F. not long ago, and we're on our own...

M4 SOPMOD II: Sure...

M4 SOPMOD II: Then let's get a move on. It's too cold here. If I don't keep moving, I'm gonna freeze!

RO635: Be careful. The terrain is way too steep here. Once we go down, we won't be able to come back up.

M16A1: Hmm...

M16A1: Should we stay and make sure...

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha, so it's a slide!

M4 SOPMOD II: Here I come!!!!!!! (Slides off)

M16A1: ...

RO635: ...The coast seems clear. Let's go.

...

RO635: Guys, we're about to get to the outpost!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, over there!

RO635: ...!

BOOM!

M16A1: Hey, that's a Jupiter, isn't it?!

M16A1: They've got one even here?!

BOOM!

RO635: Not just one...

RO635: I think we just happened to have crashed in a really bad place.

M4 SOPMOD II: What the heck?! The cannon blew the outpost to smithereens!

M4 SOPMOD II: Now what?!

RO635: Change of plan. We go around and keep moving!

RO635: Keep your eyes open. S.F. has already noticed our presence!

M16A1: We've been very careful the whole way. How did they find us?

RO635: No clue. Perhaps the Ringleader here is something else.

M16A1: You mean there are other dolls like Dreamer?

RO635: Don't worry too much for now. Sangvis forces haven't completely surrounded us yet, which means they don't have our precise location.

RO635: Let's just change our course of action and go around first.

M16A1: There's a forest to the west. It may be safer to take cover in there.

RO635: Can't be helped. We'll have to give it a shot...

RO635: Helian said another freighter was shot down in this area.

RO635: We might be able to find resources and survivors on the way. Hopefully we'll make it in time...

RO635: Before we're discovered by this unfathomable Sangvis T-Doll...

Meanwhile, in a Sangvis Ferri command post.

Architect: Haha! Yes! I got it!

Architect: Bull's-eye! Bull's-eye!

Gager: It's early in the morning... Pipe down...

Gager: So...what bull's-eye?

Architect: Hey! Gager, look!

Architect: I just hit that communication outpost!

Gager: ...

Gager: And...why did you do that?

Architect: Hmm...no reason at all.

Architect: It was just situated on a super irritating spot and I felt like testing my aim, tee-hee!

Gager: Jeez...

Gager: Don't waste your OCD on such trivial matters.

Gager: If you have the time, why don't you search for Griffin survivors?

Architect: Huh? There are survivors?

Gager: Your shell only grazed that aircraft. The probability that they managed to crash-land safely is extremely high.

Architect: Hmm... Since the data is from you...

Architect: But we're here to test these cannons, right? If both of us move out, who's gonna guard them?

Gager: I'll go look for survivors. You just stay here and keep the base secure...

Gager: And stop firing random shots. You might end up hitting friendly units.

Architect: Alright, alright, I get it.

Architect: Then I'm leaving them to you. Move along!
Part 3

M16A1: RO, there's a small heliport ahead.

RO635: Yes, I'm seeing it...

RO635: Unfortunately, it's no longer operable.

RO635: It's impossible to take off in such weather...

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, even our transmissions aren't getting anywhere...

M4 SOPMOD II: At this rate, I wonder how long our rations are gonna last...

RO635: Once the weather improves, we'll have a chance.

RO635: More importantly, the communication outpost is directly ahead. Let's keep moving!
Part 4

4

M16A1: RO, there are multiple Sangvis outposts ahead.

M16A1: Their defense isn't too strong judging by visual assessment, but we're currently low on supplies so breaking through will still be tough.

RO635: Hmm... Anything on your end, SOP II?

M4 SOPMOD II: I just saw a supply checkpoint over there. Maybe we can top up first?

M16A1: Must be the supplies from the Griffin freighter that got shot down...

M16A1: RO, that checkpoint can only provide supplies once. It'll be no different than regular checkpoints afterward.

M16A1: We should plan ahead and only use it when the situation calls for it.

RO635: Understood. I'll take that into consideration as I plan our moves.

【HINT】The resupply nodes in this area are consumptive utility nodes. They revert to normal nodes after single use.
Part 5

    5chevron_right

RO635: Be careful. The terrain is way too steep here. Once we go down, we won't be able to come back up.

M16A1: Hmm...

M16A1: Should we stay and make sure...

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha, so it's a slide!

M4 SOPMOD II: Here I come!!!!!!! (Slides off)

M16A1: ...

M16A1: ...The coast seems clear. Let's go.

【HINT】Routes marked with arrows are one-way tracks. Bear in mind that you cannot backtrack once you have traveled in the direction of the arrow.

20 minutes later.

RO635: Guys, I just flagged a location.

RO635: If the old map data is accurate, that should be a communication outpost.

M16A1: Are the comms system still usable after so long?

RO635: We don't have a choice... We must take our chances.

M4 SOPMOD II: Uhh... It seems to be getting even colder. Better get moving.

M16A1: RO, we should scavenge leftover supplies and keep ourselves replenished.

RO635: Understood. I'll keep that in mind.
Part 2

2

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha! Look, another communication outpost!

RO635: Fantastic. The door isn't locked either.

RO635: M16, could you please check the comms system inside?

M16A1: Fully functional and shows no sign of having been hacked. We're really in luck.

M4 SOPMOD II: Woohoo! Then let's go in!

M4 SOPMOD II: We have to set up a new communication network and warm ourselves up while we're at it. I'm literally turning into a popsicle!

Three minutes later.

Helian: M4...

Helian: Wait, no. M16, is that you?

M16A1: Yes, Miss Helian. We are all okay.

M16A1: We found several survivors and are now contacting you at a communication outpost to the west of where we crashed.

Helian: That's good news...

Helian: HQ has been doing everything they can to mount a rescue mission once they learned of your survival.

Helian: However, this is going to take some time due to the distance and poor weather conditions.

M16A1: We are relatively safe for now, but S.F. has probably already detected our presence.

M16A1: We've been gathering our forces by searching for other survivors, but the weather is simply too terrible.

M16A1: Low temperatures and strong winds are severely impeding our movements and replenishments.

Helian: I'm dispatching...

Helian: ...aircraft to the heli...in the southeast...

M16A1: Pardon? Miss Helian?

Helian: ...to provide supplies...

Helian: But...careful...

...

Connection broken.

M16A1: (Slams the table) Dammit!

RO635: The blizzard must be interfering with the signal...

RO635: If there's a heliport in the southeast, then they must be able to keep sending in supplies.

RO635: In any case, let's move out.
Part 3

    3chevron_right

M4 SOPMOD II: M16, look at that!

M16A1: ...!

M16A1: Is that...Jupiter?!

RO635: That's right, it's a Jupiter cannon.

RO635: Keep your distance. We don't stand a chance against its firepower.

M16A1: What do you know about this thing, RO?

RO635: We've run into something like this when patrolling human settlements in the past.

RO635: According to Persica's research, Sangvis Ferri probably acquired cannon technology after hacking into the Military's database.

RO635: Codenamed "Marduk" internally, it's most definitely developed especially to thwart us.

M4 SOPMOD II: Humph, "Griffin Killers", are they?

M4 SOPMOD II: But there's a way to deal with them, right?

RO635: It's almost impossible to take them head-on, but from what we've learned in our previous operation...

RO635: If we coordinate our forces to seize the checkpoints surrounding a mortar, we can hack into its system and significantly reduce its firepower.

M16A1: That's to say, we can neutralize its threat as long as we have it completely surrounded, right?

RO635: Precisely. If we really have to go against one, that's the best way to go at it.

RO635: Surround it first, then charge at it and take it out.

M16A1: Well...guess we should pray this battle doesn't come too soon.

RO635: Yeah, only think about it after we replenish our supplies.

RO635: Right now...we can hardly move as it is with the cold and the hunger...

【HINT】To take over a cannon node, occupying its surrounding nodes first can greatly reduce the cannon's firepower.

Half an hour later.

M16A1: The weather seems to have improved a bit, but visibility is still crap...

M16A1: Can you see the heliport on your side, RO?

RO635: (Squints) No, I...can't...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, I see it! It's over there!

M4 SOPMOD II: But...I'm not seeing any aircraft or supplies...

M16A1: That's not good. We're gonna run out of rations soon.

M16A1: If we keep moving around in the open, we're gonna be immobilized soon...

Click.

Helian: M16, are you still there?

Helian: What I was trying to say, is that the flurry is rendering a paradrop incredibly difficult.

Helian: Our drone can only make it to the heliport when the weather improves, and it'll have to withdraw immediately afterwards.

M16A1: Which means we'll have to seize the window of opportunity to re-supply at the heliport, correct?

Helian: Yes, I'll inform you of the intervals between flurries. Time your request for the supplies carefully.

Helian: Furthermore, another important T-Doll crashlanded in this area along with the freighter.

Helian: She's equipped with very valuable technical modules, so please get her out of there.

M16A1: Copy that. Who exactly is this T-Doll?

Helian: M1887, an elite T-Doll armed with a shotgun.

Helian: The last time we got in touch, she was in the shelter in the center of this area.

Helian: You'll have to enter through the southeastern route and go around the enemy's cannon blockade.

M16: Order confirmed. We'll set off for the shelter right away.
Part 2

Click.

M4 SOPMOD II: Phew...we finally made it.

M4 SOPMOD II: My body has also warmed up after some food...

M4 SOPMOD II: So this is the shelter Helian mentioned?

RO635: Should be, but do you see...

RO635: Uh...Tactical Doll M1887?

M16A1: No. According to the data, a T-Doll had indeed been here, but that was three hours ago.

M16A1: Can't be helped. We'll have to contact Helian.

Click.

M16A1: Calling Griffin HQ.

M16A1: Is this Miss Helian?

Gager: Sorry, you got the wrong channel...

Gager: Griffin.

RO635: ...?!

RO635: Who are you?!

Gager: Sangvis Ferri Manufacture SP 21 "Gager".

Gager: None of you will be leaving this place, AR Team and all present Griffin T-Dolls.

Gager: You're completely exposed the moment this connection was established.

RO635: ...

RO635: (So...we weren't exposed until just now?)

Gager: I applaud your courage and determination to survive, but I'm afraid your existence will soon come to an end.

Gager: Do please enjoy your final moments as you're about to be completely surrounded by Sangivs units...

Gager: And all hopes shall be lost for you.

Meanwhile, in a Sangvis command post.

Architect: Wow! That's a cool speech, Gager!

Architect: Show those half-baked T-Dolls who are the real pros!

Gager: (Sighs) You're hardly a pro either, horsing around all day...

Architect: Hey, I AM giving the cannons a proper run!

Architect: You see those out there? I installed all those cannons in a row. Imagine how cool it's gonna be when they fire all at once!

Gager: Is that why you set them all up together?

Gager: At this rate, not even I can guarantee we have enough resources to keep the operation going...

Architect: No biggie. This looks neat and tidy, right?!

Architect: Besides, I'm your superior! Isn't it your duty to assist me?

Gager: Sure. Then as your adjutant, I'm heading out for some pest control.

Architect: Huh? Is that necessary? Isn't it fine to just leave them alone?

Gager: By "pest", I also mean the remaining trio of the AR Team.

Architect: WHAT?! Then I'm coming too!

Gager: Who's going to take care of the base if you're also out? Not to mention they'll have to pass by the base on their way out.

Gager: Just wait here patiently and notify me the moment you detect their whereabouts.

Architect: Okie dokie! Move along! I'll keep the hearth warm!
Part 3

3

M4 SOPMOD II: Watch out ahead, RO!

RO635: ...!

M16A1: Sangvis cannons! Lots of them!

M16A1: The Ringleader...has even anticipated the route we have to take...

M4 SOPMOD II: They've installed cannons right next to each other... We can't possibly occupy them.

RO635: It would be very dangerous to force a breakthrough...

RO635: We have no choice but to circle around them.

RO635: Let's find our way carefully to the back of the cannon blockade. We're not far from the shelter!

【HINT】When it is difficult to make your way across adjacent cannon nodes that form a chain, consider finding a safer route to circle around.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

RO635: M16, what did Helian say about that heliport?

M16A1: According to Helian's intel, the flurry lets up about every fifteen hours.

M16A1: The heliport will open for five hours during the down time for us to top up our supplies.

M16A1: We must time it perfectly in order to do that.

RO635: Understood. I'll keep that in mind.

【HINT】The heliport in this area opens once every three turns. It stays open for an extra turn before closing.

Five minutes later, a Sangvis alarm starts blaring.

M4 SOPMOD II: The alarm is sounding! She's upping her game!

M16A1: Keep calm. It's gonna take a while for them to get here.

M16A1: RO, can you give us an estimate on their numbers?

RO635: ...

RO635: It's gonna be more than just a handful...I reckon.

RO635: But judging by Gager's command efficiency, I doubt she'd be able to mobilize that many teams at once.

M4 SOPMOD II: What do you mean? As in they're not gonna swarm us?

RO635: But there's another possibility...

RO635: There may be more than one Ringleader in the area.

M16A1: C'mon, two Ringleaders?

M16A1: Please tell me it's just a random guess.

RO635: It IS just a guess, but we must not panic and start scrambling around.

RO635: Let's find a spot for a breakthrough before the S.F. forces have us surrounded.

M4 SOPMOD II: What about M1887? We still haven't found her...

RO635: We haven't run into her yet, so she must be somewhere farther in.

RO635: All we can do is forge ahead and count on sheer dumb luck.

RO635: After all...our own safety comes first.

M16A1: ...

M16A1: I understand. Then lead us on, RO.
Part 2

2

...

Gager: The legendary AR Team?

Gager: Unfortunately for you, there will be no escape.

Gager: I am by no means underestimating you. I have investigated the supplies and T-Dolls you acquired along your way.

Gager: It is impossible for you to break through this blockade in your current condition.

RO635: Dammit! The cannons are too deadly. The enemy clearly anticipated our moves.

RO635: This is not going to end well. Should we retreat first...

M16A1: RO, we can't possibly beat Gager in attrition warfare!

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't care anymore! Let's just go out in a bang!

???: Please hold it.

RO635: ...?!

RO635: Encrypted channel...

RO635: Who are you?

M16A1: Don't tell me... Another Sangvis Ringleader?

M1887: Griffin Tactical Doll M1887.

M1887: RO635, lead your team and keep Gager busy.

M1887: I will find an opportunity to sever the cannons' power source.

RO635: Alone? For us?

M1887: For all of us.

M16A1: Caution, RO. She's using a Sangvis channel.

M1887: This is my way of staying undercover and keeping my location safe.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO...can we trust her?

RO635: ...

RO635: M1887, are you really a member of Griffin?

M1887: I know who I am, RO635...

M1887: And whom I serve.

RO635: Then I believe you. I hope you don't disappoint us when we meet.

RO635: We retreat for now and prepare for the next attack!
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...

M16A1: This won't do, RO! We still haven't been able to get the upper hand in the last few attacks!

M4 SOPMOD II: At this rate, we're gonna run out of ammo!

M4 SOPMOD II: Where the hell is M1887? Is she really helping us...?

RO635: Focus on what you're doing!

RO635: Another round is coming! Find cover, quick!

...

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh...? No explosions?

M1887: I've cut off the power source of the cannons.

M1887: You have ten minutes before auxiliary power comes online. Break through Gager's blockade and come to the safehouse in the valley!

M16A1: M1887...

RO635: Copy that! Let's go, guys!

Ten minutes later, everyone has made it to the safehouse.

M4 SOPMOD II: Phew... That was close...

M16A1: Such thrills...

M16A1: So, M1887, I presume?

M1887: Pleasure, AR Team.

M16A1: Now, could you please explain how you're navigating the Sangvis network?

M16A1: Sorry, but we're just a bit curious...

M1887: And suspicious, I understand.

M1887: You do know that 16Lab has recently gained some brand-new T-Doll manufacturing technology.

RO635: You're the prototype that Persica mentioned, right? The prototype of THAT tech.

M1887: Guess whose parts I'm using?

RO635: ...

RO635: Giving them a taste of their own medicine?

M1887: Not every person is born with a purpose...

M1887: But every T-Doll is created for one.

RO635: Alright, I believe you. Tell me everything you know.

RO635: SOP II, set up the comms.

RO635: We need a new encrypted channel to send a progress report to Helian.

M4 SOPMOD II: Roger. On it now!

Suddenly, M1887 raises her weapon.

M16A1: ...!

M16A1: SOP II, watch your back!

BANG!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: What are you doing, M1887?! Why did you blast the comms to pieces?!

M1887: Your team is missing a T-Doll.

M1887: She's gone because of Parapluie, hasn't she?

M16A1: ...What has that got to do with what you did?

M1887: Parapluie modules are embedded onto Sangvis equipment beforehand. They're then implanted into your comms module through physical contact.

M1887: In other words, you'll be a Parapluie carrier the moment you activate any electronic device that contains the virus.

M4 SOPMOD II: But...how do you know this specific device contains Parapluie?

RO635: Devices that carry Parapluie emit a different signal. It can be detected by an interceptor pattern even without direct contact.

RO635: This is the achievement of 16Lab's research. I'm always extra careful before I hack into Sangvis systems...except this time...

RO635: I'm sorry. I've overlooked it due to my nerves...

M16A1: S.F. takes advantage of this and catches us off guard.

M16A1: It's fine, RO. Just be careful next time...

Gager: There will be no next time, AR Team.

Gager: I finally have you...

Gager: You may have seen through my superior's little trap, but we've never placed all our bets on that anyway.

Gager: After all...I don't like winning that way...

M16A1: Humph, so you're the type to proudly bully people because you have more goons?

Gager: I merely don't like probability. Only things with no variables keep me at ease.

Gager: And it must follow, as the day the night, you'll be completely surrounded by my forces with no way to escape.

RO635: Everyone heed my order! Fortify this shelter immediately!

RO635: Prepare to defend against S.F. attack and make it through the night!

M4 SOPMOD II: Is there hope after that?

RO635: I don't know. But surely we'll stand a better chance if we manage to last till dawn?

RO635: Besides, as M16 said on the way here, Helian must have something up her sleeve.

M16A1: Ha. You're more optimistic than M4 in terms of personality.

RO635: (Smiles wistfully) All thanks to my background.

RO635: After all, this is my only saving grace.

...

Three hours later, on the outdoor training ground at Griffin HQ.

Helian: Ah, Mr Kryuger...

Kryuger: Helian, still no news from them?

Helian: Apologies. We haven't been able to get in touch.

Kryuger: The weather doesn't seem to be the problem here.

Helian: Weather conditions have improved significantly, but...night has also fallen.

Kryuger: Then leave it to the experts. They'll be there soon, right?

Helian: ETA in ten minutes...

Helian: For the experts who can handle this kind of thing.

...

......

UMP45: Hmm, got it.

UMP45: Rescuing the AR Team is our priority, correct?

Helian: Yes. Remember our informant's comms channel and watch out for the cannons.

Helian: Mr Kryuger wants to see them alive.

UMP45: We've never disappointed him...

UMP45: Not since the very beginning, have we?

Transmission terminated.

UMP9: Hmm...

UMP45: Oh, you awake?

UMP9: Was that...a call from Miss Helian?

UMP45: We have the last piece of intel. Time to set off.

UMP9: Can't believe you actually took the job.

UMP45: Huh? Is that strange?

UMP9: Nah, not really.

UMP9: But it's pretty cold. This is gonna take some getting used to.

UMP45: Humph. We already have it way better than the AR Team.

UMP45: They're still going in circles, waiting for the heliport to open.

UMP9: (Sighs) We'll have to do the same thing once the operation begins.

UMP9: And 416 isn't gonna be happy about rescuing the AR Team...

UMP45: Tee-hee. Since when have we received jobs that make us happy?

UMP45: Alright, rub the sleep off your face. I'm doing the briefing.

UMP45: We'll need to enter from the east and take over an outpost in the north to give 416 and Gr G11 the chance to infiltrate the battlefield.

UMP9: Are they already there?

UMP45: They're on standby at the outpost in the north, studying the terrain.

UMP45: 9, have our maps been updated?

UMP9: Ja! All updated!

UMP9: There are two routes to go north...up here...

UMP9: The one above is too heavily fortified. It'll be the safest bet to sneak in from the side.

UMP45: Understood. I'll take that into consideration.

UMP45: Now let's start moving. ♪

UMP9: (Gestures) Target destroyed.

UMP45: (Gestures) Advance.

UMP9: Alright, all the guards on this end have been cleaned up.

UMP45: Same on my end. The area is safe.

UMP45: 9, infiltrate the outpost and establish the channel.

UMP9: Mhmm, on it already.

Click.

UMP45: 416, do you copy?

...

UMP45: 416, are you there? Still alive?

416: ...I'm here.

UMP45: We've taken control of the outpost. You have half an hour to cross the danger zone.

416: Sure...got it.

UMP45: You sound blue.

416: You know why...

UMP45: Ja, I do, but I don't care. ♪

UMP45: Also, this operation is very dangerous.

UMP45: If you don't snap out of it, I'll...

416: Leave me behind without a second thought, I know, I know...

416: Don't worry. This won't be too hard for me to handle.

416: Besides, I'm not the type to let her emotions get the better of her...

UMP45: Then chop chop. Don't let your good mood wear off on the way~

416: ...

416: Better not offend the T-Dolls working for you, 45.

Transmission terminated.

Two minutes later.

416: Hey, Gr G11! Wake up!

416: Wake UP!

Thud!

Gr G11: Ow! How many times have I told you not to kick me?!

416: Then get up already!

Gr G11: Whoaaaa! Don't drag me! Don't drag me!

Gr G11 got forcibly dragged out of her sleeping bag.

Gr G11: Brrrrrrrrrr... It's freezing!

Gr G11: Where the heck are we? It's so much warmer in the sleeping bag!

416: (Snatches) Stay right there! Don't even think about burrowing back inside!

416: The operation is about to begin. Pack up your sleeping bag quickly and don't leave anything behind.

Gr G11: (Whimpers) Why are you all huffy with me...

Gr G11: I didn't do anything wrong. If you're mad, take it out on 45...

416: I don't even dare open a ration can, and here you are, having a good time snoozing and stuffing yourself.

416: I don't understand why 45 took this job to begin with.

Gr G11: Because we're experts. Who else could do this kinda thing?

Gr G11: If you don't like the job, you shouldn't have bothered to come...

416: ...I don't want to sit out on a mission because of such trivial reasons.

Gr G11: (Shrugs) Just leave me out of your tantrums.

Gr G11: So, we going now?

416: Uh...

416: We have to destroy the surveillance outposts on the way in order to safely rendezvous with 45 and 9.

416: Then we're gonna investigate...um...

416: Uh...the outpost "they" stopped at.

Gr G11: Ah...

Gr G11: You mean we have to uncover M16 and co.'s tracks, right?

416: ...!

Gr G11: What's wrong?

Gr G11: Huh? Wait for me, 416!

Gr G11: Carry me! My legs are frozen stiff!

...Bang! Bang!

Gr G11: There. Everything is down.

416: Good. That's the last of the patrols.

416: I'm heading into the communication outpost. You stay here and wait for 45 and 9.

...

......

Gr G11: Um...416?

416: What?

Gr G11: Are you in control...of that camera over there?

416: I'm not touching any camera.

Gr G11: But...it's moving...

Gr G11: Could this place be haunted...?

416: What?!

416: Hey, speak up. Don't be sneaky!

Architect: Ah...

Architect: Don't mind me. I'm just doing a surveillance check and looking around.

416: Looking around? (Snickers) Have Sangvis neural clouds finally evolved to the point where they don't have to kill us to survive?

Architect: Sangvis Ferri Manufacture SPzh3000 "Architect"!

Architect: My objective is to find the AR Team. Others don't matter.

Architect: (Flipping noise) And there doesn't seem to be any enemy target to attack...for my test runs today...

Architect: But who are you? You're not on the list.

416: Not your targets, in any case.

416: But...why do you want the AR Team so badly?

416: What on earth do they mean to you?

Architect: Welll...actually, only...

...!

416: ...?!

UMP45: Fraternizing with Sangvis Ferri. That's quite a serious crime, 416.

416: ...UMP45.

416: What are you doing? I almost pried important intel from her.

UMP45: That's not part of the job, 416. Don't go looking for trouble.

UMP9: Heheh, how's everybody doing?

UMP9: Did you miss me, Gr G11? (Pinches)

Gr G11: Ughhhhh...

416: Well, we've regrouped.

UMP45: Ja, and it's time to go rescue the AR Team.

UMP45: Happy, 416?

416: ...You know too well what I really want to say.

UMP45: Heheh, go on. Put your joy into words.

416: Fine. Here I go...

416: Screw you to hell, UMP45.

UMP9: Any clues yet, 45?

UMP45: The AR Team has been here before, but we don't know much on top of that.

UMP45: To confirm my suspicion, we'll need to investigate the safehouse.

Gr G11: Which means we'll have to shift base...

416: Whatever. It'd better not be a fool's errand.

UMP45: I can't guarantee anything. You'll just have to trust me.

UMP9: Of course we do, 45. Lead us on.
Part 2

...

Gr G11: I've turned this side upside down, 45. Nothing special...

416: Hush...

Gr G11: What is it?

416: Listen...

...

UMP45: Hmm...

UMP45: Mhmm...

UMP45: Got it.

Gr G11: (Whispers) What's wrong? What's so strange about 45 talking on her comms?

416: (Whispers) Check out the correspondent's signal on her screen...

Gr G11: The signal...is Sangvis?

Gr G11: But...even we can forge a Sangvis signal, right?

416: But who could this be? Who else at Griffin can forge a Sangvis signal?

Gr G11: Hmm... Now that you said it, 45 does seem to be a bit weird lately.

416: I told you, ever since we took this assignment...

416: No, even earlier than that...

416: ...

416: Gr G11...

Gr G11: What?

416: Do you remember...what Helian said about the way Parapluie spreads?

416: The operation half a year ago...

Gr G11: The time with Ouroboros?

416: You remember back then...

416: Who it was that touched the jammer?

Gr G11: Who would remember something like that...

Gr G11: It couldn't have been one of us, right?

Gr G11: We've all been screened, and we even got caught by Gr MG5 on the way...

UMP9: Hey! What are you two having a tête-à-tête about?!

Gr G11: Whoa! 9...?

416: Nothing...

416: 9, don't you think 45...

...!

UMP9: A-An alarm?!

Architect: Ahem!

Architect: Black shirts, are you listening?

Architect: I still don't have a clue who you are, but I've changed my mind!

Gr G11: Changed her mind? What does she mean?

Architect: It's already 00:00, in other words, a new day!

Architect: I need to start working according to today's schedule, which is...

Architect: In vivo testing!

416: What...?

Architect: Heheh, cool name, right?

Architect: Dreamer said I should use Jupiter on some live targets to test its maneuverability starting from today.

Architect: The faster the targets, the better...so that's gonna be you!

UMP45: What is it? Has Architect found us again...?

Gr G11: Rather...she's always known our location...

UMP9: Can she do that...just through cameras?

416: ...

Architect: Still alive, girls?

Architect: Stand up! Wave your arms!

Architect: After all, you're the stars of this party!

BOOM!

416: 45, what the hell is going on? Why...

UMP45: No time to think! The bombardment has already started!

UMP45: Leave the danger zone right now! I know where the border is!

UMP9: Then what about the AR Team?

UMP45: Don't worry...

UMP45: This is all part of the plan.

...

Gr G11: Phew...we're finally safe. That's exhausting...

UMP9: Heheh, 416 is obviously more exhausted...

UMP9: Oh? Not gonna strike back, 416?

416: ...

416: Isn't this a bit strange, 45?

416: Why had our movements been exposed to Architect's cameras?

UMP45: Oh? You think that was deliberate?

UMP45: Your paranoia is running wild again, 416.

416: Then please say something to cure me.

UMP9: 416...

UMP45: Humph...

UMP45: It takes time to set up the scene. The longer it takes, the bigger our advantage.

UMP45: Now is when our operation truly begins.

UMP45: You see that outpost ahead?

UMP9: That's...Architect's base, right?

UMP45: Correct. Our objective is to raid it.

416: Are you kidding...

416: We're in a field full of heavy cannons. Isn't the base even more fortified?

UMP45: That's usually the case.

UMP45: But this time, we're up against an unusual enemy.

UMP9: And we're an unusual team of T-Dolls!

UMP9: I believe 45 will only act on a foolproof plan!

Gr G11: You lost again, 416.

416: (Sighs)

416: Well, you're the leader.

UMP45: Then time to move along, girls.

UMP45: Give Architect no time to react. Start running!

Architect: Hey, what is going on?!

Architect: When did these black shirts get around me?!

UMP45: Now, 9! Cut off the power!

UMP9: Roger!

...!

Architect: Hey! The power is out again?!

Architect: But don't celebrate just yet! I've found the command for the auxiliary power already!

Architect: ...

Architect: Uh, I can't really see during nighttime!

Architect: Let me find a light switch first!

UMP45: This is our chance! Retreat!

UMP9: Huh? We're not going in while she's confused?

UMP45: Our objective isn't to infiltrate the base. We'll be in danger once the power comes back online.

M1887: I see the power has been cut off, 45. Nicely done.

416: Sangvis signal...

416: Who is this, 45?

UMP45: Tactical Doll M1887, our informant.

UMP45: She has a low-level Sangvis signal, which she's been using to aid us covertly.

UMP45: And just so you know, the AR Team is also with her.

UMP9: Tee-hee. Since both sides make use of Sangvis signals, our communications are completely off the radar.

Gr G11: Who'd have thought...that we're not the only ones who have mastered this trick.

M1887: It's merely an expedient.

M1887: You have bought time for the AR Team to slip away, but the battle is still underway.

M1887: Please keep distracting Architect. This is the only way for us to throw Gager off our trail.

416: We're not very well-stocked ourselves, 45. How long is this operation gonna last?

UMP45: Not too long, 416.

UMP45: I have a different plan...

Architect: Jeez... Is playing hide-and-seek your only trick?

Architect: I just wanted to have some fun, but at this rate you're gonna piss me off for real.

Architect: I've figured out the pattern of your movements, black shirts...

Architect: I can tell which outpost you're gonna pop up at ten minutes later.

Architect: Humph, you're in for a nasty surprise there! And you're gonna regret pulling stupid pranks on me!

Ten minutes later.

BOOM!

Architect: Heheh! That shot must've been a pretty good hello!

Architect: Let me go and see how it worked!

...

Architect: Huh? Where are they?

Architect: Why...aren't they here?

Gager: Architect!

Architect: Huh? Looking for me? Have you caught the AR Team?

Gager: You...

Gager: You IDIOT! Has your AI shorted?! Why did you leave the base?!

Architect: Hmm...

Architect: Chill. I've set up the defense program. There's no way they could get in.

Gager: That's not the problem! The T-Dolls have already gone around the mortars and run away while you're out!

Architect: Whaaaaaat?!

Architect: That can't be right! How would they know when I would set off?!

Gager: Did you power off the mortars when you left?

Architect: No, I had to corner them with the mortars and...

Architect: Oh!

Architect: So that's why!

Gager: (Sighs)

Architect: Arghhh! Do you expect me to understand something this complicated?!

Gager: Never mind...

Gager: Return to the base immediately and go on red alert, do you copy?

Architect: Hey, how dare you order me around?! I'm your superior...

Gager: DO. YOU. COPY?!

Architect: Whoa! A-Alright! (Runs)

Gager: ...

Gager: We can't let them escape...

Gager: I absolutely won't have Dreamer belittle us again!

Meanwhile.

M4 SOPMOD II: M16, I'm running low on ammo!

M16A1: Same here! I'm out of grenades! What about you, RO?!

RO635: (Throws) This is the last one. Save it.

M16A1: Thanks. I hope I'll live long enough to use it.

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't say such things! I don't wanna die in a place like this!

M16A1: Just kidding. After all, we've almost made it through the night.

...

M16A1: I think Helian...is about to show the ace up her sleeve.

...!

M4 SOPMOD II: Gunfire! From allies!

UMP45: Did you miss me?

UMP45: ...♪

M16A1: ...

M16A1: So it really is you...

UMP45: Do you still wish you'll never see us again?

M16A1: Ha...

M16A1: Business is business. That's what you taught me.

UMP45: Exactly. Otherwise, I would never come to such a place...

UMP45: Sadly...this is fate.

M16A1: It's just an order, 45.

M16A1: Hand me some ammo. I'll pave the way.

UMP45: You think...I'd brought you ammo?

M16A1: Of course...

M16A1: I don't expect you to go in the front and eat bullets for us, minx.

...

M16A1: Grenade!

BOOM!

Five minutes later, at the AR Team's temporary shelter.

RO635: Is everyone here?

M16A1: Phew... No one got left behind...

M4 SOPMOD II: So you're the legendary 404, right?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Have you come all the way to our rescue?

UMP9: Tee-hee, of course!

UMP9: After all, we're experts in night ops.

M16A1: ...

M16A1: I'll give you that. But why hadn't you contacted us in advance?

UMP45: Because there's more than one Ringleader in the area. We didn't want to alert the other one.

RO635: So it's true...

RO635: Thank you for coming to our rescue, members of Squad 404.

416: Don't bother. It's just an order.

M4 SOPMOD II: Still...how did the four of you manage to fight against Gager?

Gr G11: Uh...

Gr G11: It's...no longer Gager alone.

RO635: Pardon?

Gr G11: We've probably pissed off the other one as well...

RO635: UMP45, you're the leader of Squad 404.

RO635: The situation is critical. Surely you have a plan to get us all out of here?

UMP45: I do have a few ideas, but...

UMP45: We've fought off this round of Sangvis attack. Let's leave the shelter first.

UMP45 walks out of the shelter.

416: ...

M16A1: Um...

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah, 416 is gone as well.

M4 SOPMOD II: You know her, M16?

M16A1: Sort of...

M16A1: But that's not important...

M16A1: RO, stay in command, okay?

RO635: Ah...I will. I have the highest command efficiency after all.

M16A1: That's not what I meant.

M16A1: If you want every single T-Doll to make it home, hold on tight to your command...

M16A1: Do NOT hand it over to UMP45, do you understand?

RO635: Yeah...I will.

...

UMP45: It's almost dawn...

UMP45: Looks like you're all set to go, Miss RO635?

RO635: ...

RO635: How would M4A1 answer you?

UMP45: I've never met her, so I don't know.

RO635: You've never met me either, have you?

UMP45: M16 told me you're...a secret experiment.

UMP45: I try not to stir up extra trouble so as not to jeopardize the mission, but I'm curious...

UMP45: Are you willing to be...such a "thing"?

RO635: ...I don't find it disagreeable for the time being.

UMP45: You don't necessarily have to live in the shadow of M4A1...

UMP45: Besides, her neural cloud isn't particularly mature, so she probably wouldn't have performed much better than you.

RO635: She managed to keep everyone safe in the last operation. That is something I definitely wouldn't have been able to do.

UMP45: The point is, you two are different T-Dolls on different missions...

UMP45: Why don't you be yourself instead of someone else's substitute?

UMP45: Do you truly wish to protect everyone?

RO635: ...

RO635: You don't disappoint, UMP45. I have heard a few things about your squad...

RO635: To maintain efficiency, I'll be in charge of the rest of the operation, any objections?

UMP45: None whatsoever...

UMP45: I'm sure you'll do a much better job than I, Miss RO...

UMP45: May I call you that?

RO635: Sure, everyone does.

RO635: We just want to get out of here as quickly as possible, 45. Can I count on you for help?

UMP45: That's the job Helian has given me. And business is business. That's my motto.

RO635: Thank you. That's all I need to hear.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

UMP9: What are you looking at, 45?

UMP45: Some...new discovery.

UMP45: Look, that artillery station there only has a single Jupiter cannon installed.

Gr G11: How come...? Did S.F. go on strike halfway through the construction?

UMP45: Simple. The AR Team accidentally wandered into the Sangvis cannon testing ground.

UMP45: Many cannons aren't installed in time...

416: New idea, 45?

UMP45: I think we can break through those incomplete cannons with what we have.

UMP45: That's gonna save us a lot of time and resources.

UMP9: Sure, let's do it.

UMP9: But make proper observation beforehand and don't go charging at full-fledged cannons!

【HINT】Some cannon nodes are significantly impaired and easier to confront directly. Observe and strategize accordingly.

...

Individual surveillance complete.

M16A1: RO, S.F. has set up several blockades in the area. Fighting our way through directly is nothing short of suicide.

UMP9: But it's gonna take a lot of effort to go around.

UMP45: ... (Smiles)

RO635: ...

RO635: I think...this isn't the time to jump to conclusions.

RO635: Let's find a safe place and contact Griffin HQ first.

M4 SOPMOD II: I just found a communication outpost somewhere nearby. Minimal security.

Gr G11: I'm the source of the map...

RO635: Very well. Then let's take over the outpost!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Arrived at the communication outpost.

RO635: Stay here. I'll set up the channel.

UMP45: Right. Let's rest up a bit...

RO635: Could you come with me, 45? I'll need you and M16 to report to Helian in a second.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Sure.

Other team members are resting on the spot.

M16A1: ...

416: ...

UMP9: Uh...

UMP9: Uh...Gr G11?

Gr G11: zzzzzz...

Gr G11: zzzZZZZZzzzzz...

UMP9: (Sighs)

M4 SOPMOD II: How nice... Being able to fall asleep at will even at a time like this...

UMP9: Haha... She's always been like that...

UMP9: Why don't you catch a nap too, SOP II?

M4 SOPMOD II: Nah, I'm not sleepy at all.

M4 SOPMOD II: Come to think of it, I've heard a lot about you guys...

UMP9: Oh? Us? Must be some really nasty rumors, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Not really. I actually think you guys are really cool.

M4 SOPMOD II: And now that I've met you in person, you don't seem all that strange...

UMP9: Heheh, how different can T-Dolls be? Not to mention we're now all comrades-in-arms going through fire and water together, right?

416: I'd rather not consider going through fire here...

416: Especially with HER..

UMP9: Umm...416...

M16A1: I don't mind either way...

M16A1: After all, if all hope is lost, I won't really care whom I'm gonna die next to.

416: Tsk...

UMP9: M16...

UMP9: We're also very sorry...about what happened to AR-15.

M16A1: (Chuckles) You know everything, don't you? As expected of 404...

M16A1: But thanks. She fulfilled her purpose...

UMP9: And about M4...

UMP9: I'm truly sorry. I hear she...

M16A1: It's not that bad...

M16A1: Or should I say, it's actually safer for her...

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah... At least we have RO with us. We don't have to worry too much about our operations.

416: Where did she come from?

416: Why does everyone in your team have this ridiculous hero complex...?

M16A1: That's none of your business, 416.

416: Humph, you're right...

416: It doesn't matter what I think... Matters to no one...

Gr G11: What are you thinking, 416...

UMP9: Huh? Gr G11...

Gr G11: Give me back my blanket...zzzzZZZZ...

UMP45 comes over and claps her hands.

UMP45: Ladies, the sun is coming up, and we need to get a move on.

UMP45: I've contacted Helian and been told that HQ has dispatched a large rescue team.

UMP45: However, the aircraft can only transport them to a large heliport on the border.

RO635: So that heliport is going to be our rendezvous point as well as our final destination.

UMP45: Ja, and let's hope...everyone makes it there safely. ♪

M16A1: ...

M16A1: Yeah, I sure hope so...

RO635: Guys, there's still a considerable distance between us and the heliport.

RO635: We'll have to pass through multiple Sangvis blockades. Please be prepared.

Gr G11: Argh...such a bother...

Gr G11: It would've been much easier with just the four of us...

M16A1: Haha... Don't worry. We're all pretty experienced here. We won't slow you down.

416: You'd better not...

416: We're never gonna hear the end of it if your team loses another member.

M16A1: ...

UMP9: Ah! Um! Speaking of which!

UMP9: Uh...

UMP9: Anything to say, 45?

UMP45: Huh...?

UMP45: Uh... In terms of experience, we do have more say regarding infiltration.

UMP45: RO, there's a Sangvis command post ahead.

UMP45: I think cutting off its surveillance will ensure our safe passage.

RO635: Hmm...I agree.

RO635: I'll think of something to keep the coast clear. The rest is up to your team, UMP45.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Small-scale Sangvis command post occupied.

UMP45: Done. You can come in, RO.

Fifteen minutes later.

RO635: Report our status to Helian...

RO635: Hmm? Where's 416?

UMP45: She...She's gone on sentry duty outside for a change of scenery.

RO635: May I ask what...history there is between her and M16?

UMP45: Ah...

UMP45: Nothing much. Just a little misunderstanding that they won't let go.

Meanwhile, at the resting spot.

UMP9: Sorry, M16. 416 didn't really mean it...

Gr G11: No, she obviously did...

UMP9: (Punches) You Dummkopf! Are you even on our side?!

Gr G11: Ow! I'm sorry!

M16A1: Haha...

M16A1: It doesn't matter. I know 416...

M16A1: She has too many things pent up in her chest and loses it every now and then.

UMP9: Hmm...so you do know about us...

Gr G11: Huh? I don't! What are you talking about? About 416?

M16A1: Well...

416: Hey! We have a situation out there!

Gr G11: ...

416: W-What is it?

UMP9: ...

416: Anyway, this is no time to talk!

416: Sangvis forces are moving in this direction. ETA in 20 minutes!

M16A1: Huh? That soon?! Have they sniffed us out?

416: Not sure, but this place isn't safe anymore. Notify everyone. We're moving out!

UMP45: Miss Helian, do you copy?

UMP45: S.F. has located us. What is the status of the rescue party?

Helian: Weather conditions are improving.

Helian: The heliports in the area are now fully operational.

416: Finally, some good news.

M16A1: So we can use the heliports anytime, right?

Helian: Yes, but only in this area.

Helian: And our rescue party is going to arrive later than expected as mobilizing such large forces hinders our efficiency.

UMP9: Huh? Couldn't you send a team to aid us first?

Helian: Our recon team has spotted new Sangvis forces in the vicinity.

Helian: They are very likely to be a Sangvis unit's backup, so it's very risky to just dive in.

Helian: Contact me again after you come up with a specific plan of action. We'll do our best to coordinate with you.

Connection broken.

Gr G11: So...if we don't hurry up, we're gonna be fenced in?

M4 SOPMOD II: Then let's just run for it!

RO635: We've used up too many supplies.

RO635: It'll be incredibly hard to break through the Sangvis base in our current condition, especially considering the possibility of fighting against two Ringleaders.

UMP45: I know where the supply outpost is in this area, but getting there is gonna take a while.

UMP45: Besides, if a Sangvis Ringleader decides to actively search for us...

M1887: Leave it to us. We'll stall the encircling forces.

M1887: Our aircraft was shot down by Jupiter around here, so we know this area.

M1887: And we've been relying on your command throughout the entire operation. We, too, want to be of use.

RO635: ...

RO635: I understand. Then please lend me your strength.

RO635: 45, please give me the shortest route to the supply outpost.

RO635: We're moving immediately.

【HINT】The use of the heliports in this area (applies only to map 3-3 in Operation Arctic Warfare) is not restricted by turns.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...

RO635: Guys, we've got the supplies. Time to regroup!

RO635: The rescue party is about to arrive at the heliport! We'll just have to hang in there for a bit longer and make it through the Sangvis base-

Architect: Heheh... Only "about to arrive"?

UMP45: ...!

Gager: We've figured out the characteristics of encrypted Griffin signals.

Gager: You can no longer scuttle around under our noses...

Architect: ...nor break through our blockades head-on!

Architect: We've even come up with all the job delegation and defense stratagems!

Architect: Well? If you wanna surrender, I can consider keeping your neural cloud backups.

Transmission terminated.

Gr G11: I-Is there no going home?

416: Shut up. Is this really the time to freak out?

M16A1: It IS a bit of a handful to engage two Sangvis Ringleaders at once...

UMP45: However...

UMP45: I doubt they'd strike at the same time.

UMP45: Someone has to guard the base and control the cannons.

RO635: That would be Architect.

RO635: If the rescue party can storm the base from the back...

RO635: UMP45, could you contact Helian?

UMP45: Helian said the rescue party is still several hours away.

RO635: Tough luck...

RO635: How can we hold off till then...

UMP45: My, my... Are things really that desperate?

UMP45: In that case, leave it to us...

RO635: You...?

UMP45: Ja...

UMP45: Aren't we the perfect answer to this kind of thing?

M16A1: ...

Five minutes later, M16 and RO635 are having a private conversation.

M16A1: (Whispers) RO, remember what I said.

RO635: How could that be? They're here to rescue us.

RO635: I heard that for Squad 404, the ends justify the means, but they have never failed.

M16A1: She is ONLY here to rescue US.

M16A1: If you want everyone to make it safely to the heliport...don't leave everything to her.

M16A1: Remember. YOU are the one in command.

RO635: I may not be as experienced as you, M16, but do you have to be this wary?

M16A1: If we're talking about the one with the foxy eyes, I'm actually worried that I'm not wary enough.

RO635: What about M4? What would she do?

M16A1: M4? She'd obviously listen to me.

M16A1: Of course, you don't necessarily have to do that, but you must make your own judgment.

M16 pats RO lightly on the shoulder.

RO635: ...

RO635: My own judgment...

RO635: (Laughs helplessly) As if T-Dolls can have such a thing...

...

UMP45: Right. Are the preparations done, RO?

RO635: Are you sure about this, 45?

UMP45: I've given you both our maps and my suggestion. The rest depends on how much you trust me.

RO635: ...Okay.

RO635: Listen. Squad 404 will infiltrate the Sangvis base and shut down the main power supply of the cannons.

M16A1: The same old trick? Architect will be prepared for that.

UMP45: I realized something before.

UMP45: Her authorization doesn't allow her to guard all the power sources at the same time.

RO635: That will only buy us some time, but it'll be enough for us to move out.

UMP9: On top of the power supply, we'll also sabotage their comms channel.

UMP9: That will mess up their coordination and buy us even more time.

RO635: That's it. Meanwhile, M1887 will lead the other T-Dolls to draw Gager's attention.

M1887: So we'll be facing two Ringleaders simultaneously?

RO635: Indeed. I'm afraid you'll have to backup your neural clouds beforehand.

RO635: Don't worry. You will have my full attention before Squad 404 complete their objective.

M4 SOPMOD II: But that's forcing it quite a bit...

RO635: This is our only chance.

RO635: The AR Team will raid the the base, hack into its control system and open the gateway leading to the outside.

RO635: Then all hands make for the gateway and be ready to welcome the rescue party at the heliport. Understood?

M16A1: RO...

M16A1: You're the only one we can count on. I hope you understand that.

RO635: Don't worry. I remember what you said.

RO635: Please trust me, everyone, and let's go home together.

M1887: I'll obey all orders issued by the one in command, as that is the first order all T-Dolls are given.

UMP45: Very well. Any more objections?

UMP45: Then let's prepare for our final stand, RO.
Part 2

...

Gager: Hey! Architect, where are you aiming?

Gager: Griffin T-Dolls are running all over the place! Where is your artillery?!

Architect: Arghhhhhh I'm having a hard time over here too! The black shirts have cut off my power supply again!

Architect: My forces can't guard all the power sources so my cannons are only functioning at half capacity! Come help me out!

Gager: If I come back to base, all our important outposts will be taken by Griffin.

Gager: I'll send you some of my troops to guard the auxiliary power supply.

Architect: Arghhhhhh can't I just come out and fight them myself?!

Gager: You're too dumb. If you head out, you'll definitely be surrounded.

Gager: Stay in the base and blow up any T-Doll that runs past you!

Gager: Leave everything outside to me...

Architect: Gager...

Architect: B-Be safe!

Architect: Make sure you come back alive! Do you hear-

Bang!

Connection broken.

Gager: Architect?

Gager: Calling Architect! Do you copy?!

Gager: Even comms are down... Could it be 404's doing...?

Gager: I was going to let them be, but looks like I was too soft...

Gager: I will never surpass Dreamer if I keep wavering...

Gager: I must be more brutal! More deranged!

Gager: All troops heed my order! Change of objective! Abandon previous plan of capture!

Gager: From now on, kill every non-AR Team T-Doll on sight!

Meanwhile.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, looks like Squad 404's move is working!

M16A1: It's our turn.

M16A1: Let's infiltrate the base and open the gateway now.

RO635: ...

M1887: Calling RO. Gager's attack is getting more ferocious.

M1887: Can we retreat now?

RO635: Not yet, M1887...

RO635: Not even close...

M1887: But we might not be able to keep this up for long.

RO635: It would actually be more dangerous if you do.

M1887: What?

RO635: Everyone, a slight change of plan.

RO635: Please keep engaging the two Ringleaders.

M16A1: Where are we going, RO?

RO635: A communication outpost. I'm leaving it to you to get in touch with Helian, M16.

M4 SOPMOD II: But...Helian's rescue party is too big! They won't make it here in time!

RO635: Then what if...

RO635: What if we ask the Commander to come first?

M16A1: ...

M16A1: The weather condition and the Sangvis blockades on the way all pose considerable risks to the vanguard...

RO635: That's not the point, M16, SOP II...

RO635: If it were M4, she would trust her commander, wouldn't she?

......

UMP45: Too long...

UMP45: Why are they taking so long...

UMP9: We can't afford to wait any longer, 45.

UMP9: Their power supply and comms are coming back online in three minutes max.

UMP9: Once they have auxiliary power, none of us will make it out!

UMP45: We're running out of time. Let's withdraw.

Gr G11: Huh? Are we abandoning the mission?

UMP45: We've cleared the way.

UMP45: If everything is going according to the plan, the AR Team is on standby somewhere close. They'll find a chance to make their way through.

416: Hey, 45!

416: What about the others? M1887 and her troops are still in the field.

UMP45: That's not our objective, 416.

416: ...

416: What about you, 9?

416: What do you think?

UMP9: I...I only listen to 45...

UMP9: I don't have anything personal against the AR Team...

UMP9: But...business is business, right?

416: ...

Gr G11: I...I just take orders. Don't ask my opinion.

416: But the AR Team won't agree to this. They're not like us.

UMP45: They can't say no. This is their only chance.

UMP45: Either they leave with us alive, or die here with them. We can't save everyone.

416: Has this been your plan all along?

UMP45: Is there a problem, 416?

UMP45: You yourself don't plan on staying behind either, right?

UMP45: Mind you, you can't go back to M16. That "squad" no longer exists!

416: ...!

UMP45: Let go of your pathetic pride and join us for real...

UMP45: Only if we be their stain will they truly value us.

Gr G11: 45...

UMP9: 45...

UMP9: The three minutes are almost up, but RO still hasn't responded...

UMP45: ...? Check their coordinates. They should be nearby.

UMP9: No, they're not even in our surveillance area...

Gr G11: What? Are they...not coming?

RO635: Sorry to keep you waiting, 45.

RO635: There's been a slight change of plan.

RO635: We didn't raid Architect's base and went for an outpost in the other direction instead.

UMP45: What...the hell are you doing?

UMP45: Doesn't that put us in grave danger?

UMP45: Once the power comes back online, we're gonna be the first to die.

UMP45: Have you considered the feelings of your saviors, RO635?

RO635: Don't worry, 45.

RO635: Someone will be taking our place. We won't be putting anyone at risk.

UMP45: ...!

UMP45: Gunfire behind the door!

Thompson: Dear me, looks like we've barely made it in time.

Thompson: Time to clean up. Make sure you keep the dirt away from me...

WA2000: Save your breath, Thompson.

WA2000: I'll kill everything that gets in our way. Focus on your job.

...!

Architect: YESSSSSS! My power is finally back online!

Architect: Gager, did you hear me?! Now's the time to flush out the rats!

Gager: Architect! Do you copy?!

Gager: Large Griffin reinforcement incoming from behind the base! Withdraw at once! Hurry!

Architect: Huh...

Architect: Huhhhhhhh?! Why are there so many of them?!

Architect: Hey, my lady knight! You can't just ignore your superior officer when she's in danger!

Gager: You're strong. You'll make it out alive.

Gager: I'll meet you outside, so just get out of the base. Quick!

Architect: Alright, I'm running!

Architect: But you hurry up yourself, 'cause I might get lost in-

Bang!

Gager: Architect?!

Gager: Answer me, Architect!

Agent: Save it. She failed.

Agent: Griffin has dispatched a field commander. Their troops have already started mobilizing.

Agent: Your cannon installation drones are no match against those T-Dolls.

Gager: Agent...

Gager: You found out...

Agent: I never expected much from Architect, but...

Agent: If you had notified me sooner, it would not have come to this.

Gager: I didn't expect them to be so swift.

Gager: This is all we could do...

Agent: This was my mistake in job delegation...

Agent: I had hoped the two of you could acquire more experience in this operation, but my plan was ruined by these trespassing rats...

Agent: Thank you for everything you have done. Leave the rest to me.

Gager: ...Understood.

Gager: I am handing my command authorization to you, Agent.

Gager: But as you said, these troops are no match against the Griffin field commander...

Agent: Don't forget that I have my own forces...

Agent: Hundreds and thousands of units...

Agent: It is time to make your acquaintance, Griffin Commander...

Meanwhile, in the Sangvis command post.

Architect: Whoa! Why are comms down?!

Architect: Huh? Don't tell me...they wrecked the equipment?!

WA2000: Quiet, Architect.

WA2000: If you so much as twitch a hair, the next thing to be wrecked is your head.

Architect: ...

Architect: Jeez, so the sniper is already in position?

Architect: But don't underestimate me. I can pack quite a punch!

Thompson: Really? Perfect...

Thompson: I was just thinking this job is way too easy.

Architect: W-Who the hell are you?!

Architect: You have so many T-Dolls with you! That's not fair!

Thompson: I'm just a lowly wall plasterer.

Thompson: But I can't really start working until I see what's been splashed onto the wall.

Architect: ...

Architect: Fine. Happy?

Thompson: Oh? Surrendering just like that?

Architect: I'm not obliged to fight to the bitter end anyway.

Architect: So long as I have food and water, I don't care where I go.

Architect: Well? I'll cooperate, so don't worry!

Helian: Capture her first. Have her completely restrained, then bring her back!

WA2000: Careful, Thompson. This could be a trap.

Thompson: I've never seen any trap. All I've seen are a bunch of corpses who tried to be clever.

Thompson: You're not very clever though, are you, Architect?

Architect: Ahaha... That's right, I'm an idiot!

WA2000: This is the first time I've seen a Sangvis turncoat...

WA2000: Who the hell are you? Why do you have such ludicrous authorization?

Architect: Uh... Well...

Architect: There must be something wrong with me...?

Architect: So please be nice to me. I know a lot of interesting things.

...

RO635 and all T-Dolls have regrouped safely and are withdrawing to the heliport with the Commander's aid...

UMP45: ...

UMP45: You finally showed up, RO.

RO635: ...

RO635: Should I apologize, 45?

UMP45: Why should you? You were in command.

UMP45: It's just that...

UMP45: How is your choice any different from M4A1's?

RO635: You mean contacting Helian?

UMP45: I mean trying to save everyone.

UMP45: If the Commander hadn't listened to you and rushed here at all cost...

UMP45: All our deaths would've been on you.

RO635: I think I now know...

RO635: ...why you always do things your way.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Then are you content to just lose your sense of self and become someone else's substitute?

RO635: But...what exactly is my "sense of self"?

UMP45: ...

RO635: I was...created for this to begin with.

RO635: I will not abandon those who M4 wants to protect.

RO635: And I will believe in those who M4 believes in.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: In any case, you did the right thing in this operation.

UMP45: Congratulations, AR Team. We may not be able to celebrate with you, but surely we can have a handshake at the very least.

RO635: Of course. I also think you are all exceptional T-Dolls.

RO635: It is an honor knowing you, UMP45.

UMP45: Really? But unfortunately...

UMP45: You won't know us anymore very soon.

RO635: ...!

RO635: What is that in your hand?!

UMP45: No reason to fear. Just a small authorization program...

UMP45: ...that will access your neural cloud and delete something...

UMP45: ...about us...

RO635: UMP45, so this is how...

UMP45: Ja, this is how Squad 404 have survived this long...

UMP45: Can't be helped. Even if we didn't do this, HQ would...

UMP45: While we still remember each other, RO635, let me tell you one last thing...

...

UMP45: Plan Parapluie is far from over...

UMP45: Goodbye then, young autonomous Doll...

UMP45: I envy you, truly...

...

Ten minutes later.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO! RO!

RO635: Huh?

M4 SOPMOD II: What are you still doing here?! The operation is about to begin!

RO635: Operation? What operation?

M4 SOPMOD II: Agent is launching a counteroffensive with a large force! We must repel them!

RO635: Repel?

RO635: Aren't we withdrawing?

M16A1: Change of plan, RO.

M16A1: We have to hold on until the large freighters arrive to carry that thingy away.

RO635: Thingy? What thingy?

M4 SOPMOD II: The thingy!

M4 SOPMOD II: Jupiter, duh!

RO635: Ju...piter...?!

RO635: Are you...kidding me...?

M16A1: I'll explain later. Agent's forces are coming!

M4 SOPMOD II: The Commander is also here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's have a proper brawl and bring that thing home with us!

【HINT】Operation Arctic Warfare concluded. Hidden stage unlocked.

While the AR Team and co. are getting out of danger, in a Griffin temporary command post.

Helian: Good morning, Commander.

Helian: Good work in the previous rescue mission. It must have been tough mobilizing so many teams on such short notice.

Helian: The ad-hoc operation was extremely risky, but we gave the green light because we have complete faith in you.

Helian: We will give you a special award in honor of your valor.

Helian: However, the battle is not over yet, and we're giving you a special assignment...

Persica: Let me do the talking, Helian.

Persica: Long time no see, Commander.

Persica: While we were on the way, the captured Sangvis unit mentioned something...

Architect: Hey, I have a name! I'm Architect!

Architect: And that was a slip of the tongue! Don't believe me!

Persica: Please refer to the screen...

Persica: According to the Sangvis unit, this is a cannon that Sangvis Ferri modified independently from the prototype of a military weapon.

Persica: I'm curious how Mastermind managed to make such calculations with just the AI of T-Dolls.

Architect: Humph, we're all very clever! Aren't you jealous?

Persica: Meanwhile, I'm also very curious about the Military's weapons tech.

Persica: Which is why, Commander, Kryuger has agreed to dispatch a large squadron to transport a prototype of the Jupiter cannon.

Architect: Hey, that is our baby! I won't let you take it apart! Or move it away!

Helian: Redo her gag, Tommy.

Architect: Mmmm...! Hnnnng...!

Persica: The only problem is this mortar is huge, so it's gonna take some time to have it dismantled and transported.

Persica: Before we're done, could you please fend off the Sangvis attack?

Persica: It's not gonna take too long, Commander. You have my thanks.
Part 2

Meanwhile, in the Factory at Griffin HQ.

Helian: Mr. Kryuger, our freighters have completed the cannon extraction.

Kryuger: Fantastic. Serendipity never fails to cheer me up.

Helian: (Chuckles) Perhaps this has something to do with your previous job?

Kryuger: I don't deny that.

Kryuger: Besides, not many contractors can get their hands on the Military's technology.

Helian: By the way, the Commander is still on the frontline. Should we give the order to withdraw?

Kryuger: Not yet.

Kryuger: If the Commander's team is still holding up, keep the operation going.

Kryuger: Reward them according to their performance in battle after the withdrawal.

Helian: Are you...testing the Commander's limit?

Kryuger: Not testing. Exploring.

Kryuger: We'll need that knowledge one day.

Kryuger: Regarding Squad 404, Have the neural clouds of all witnesses been wiped?

Helian: Yes. However, there is still some leftover memory in M16A1...

Kryuger: I know. Things from before the creation of 404 don't matter.

Kryuger: Give them a holiday. They need it.

Kryuger: Perhaps we need one, too.

Helian: When the Commander returns, perhaps we should organize a banquet...

Helian: Something...warm.

Helian: To celebrate spring, festivities, victory, and all things bright and beautiful...

Helian: To give thanks to the Commander as well as the T-Dolls. They have all worked hard.

Kryuger: No problem. You're in charge.

Helian: Play your part too, Mr. Kryuger. Try to come up with a speech that isn't so rigid.

Kryuger: That's gonna be tough.

Kryuger: I'm not sure if I can finish it before the Commander makes it back.

Helian: Don't worry. The Commander is going to last very long.

Helian: How about a bet? On who's the first to finish their job?

Kryuger: Well, let's wait and see...

【HINT】Keep defending against Sangvis attacks to earn more rewards.
