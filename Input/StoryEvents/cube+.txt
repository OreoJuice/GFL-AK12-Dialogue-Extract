Five days after AR-15 has gone missing.

Helian: ...That is our latest information on AR-15, Mr. Kryuger. The Commander and AR Team are still actively searching for her.

Helian: In addition, I have approved the [Emergency Command Authority] for Squad 404.

Kryuger: ...You should've only given them the authority as a last resort.

Helian: The threat 404 faced was far more serious than expected.

Helian: Perhaps that jammer really is related to Parapluie.

Kryuger: Hm...

Kryuger: Where are they now?

Helian: They are currently operating in Area S06.

Helian: We'll have to wait for them to come back alive for further information.

Meanwhile at the territory of dispute in Area S06.

UMP9: Hey, wake up.

UMP9: 416, wake up~!

UMP9: Heyyyy~~!

416: Ugh...

416: ...Shut up.

UMP9: Hey! You doing okay, 416?

416: If you want me to say "I'm doing great" then help me move this rock...

UMP9: Alright. We have three minutes until the S.F. clean-up teams arrive, so I'll help you out.

UMP9: (Moving rock) Do you hear that gunfire in the distance? I'm out of here if I see trouble.

416: I'll twist your head off if you dare turn your back on me.

UMP9: Don't be so vicious. It's not my fault that the Sangvis are prepared.

UMP9: It's only a communications jammer. Do they really need to be defending it this desperately?

416: We underestimated the situation. There's a reason why Helian gave us such a high offer.

UMP9: Yeah, and this place is full of radar stations. We'll get spotted as soon as we poke our heads out.

416: Then let's quickly capture those radar stations since we're engaging in night battle, otherwise we won't even have vision of the area.

UMP9: I don't think we can do it with just the two of us. The Sangvis have armored units this time.

416: Is that so...

416: No wonder our bullets are useless. Can we somehow get armor piercing ammo?

UMP9: 45 is trying to come up with a solution, but I don't know if she has figured anything out yet...

416: Quit pulling my leg, 9. 45's already got it figured out, hasn't she?

UMP9: (Stop) Eh? How do you know...?

416: Because it's been three minutes and you still haven't ran yet.

UMP9: Ha...♪

UMP9: This is the last of them. Count yourself lucky.

UMP9: I'll contact 45 now. You find a spot to set up an ambush.

UMP9: But seriously though, the Sangvis are gonna be here very soon. You sure you don't wanna pray first?

416: The Sangvis are the ones who will be praying if everything goes well with 45's plan.

UMP45: Calling UMP9, is 416 dead yet?

416: Sorry to disappoint. Tell me you're going to withdraw us now.

UMP45: Don't be in such a rush to leave, 416. I don't plan on losing.

UMP45: I'll break you guys out. 9 will then group up with me for a new objective.

UMP45: Gr G11 is gathering intel in enemy territory, so you'll need to meet up with her and act as her bodyguard, 416. We'll pick you two up after.

416: (Sigh) Don't be in such a rush to give us orders when we're not even prepared to go against armored enemies.

UMP9: (Quietly) And we have to find the jammer in the dark as well...

UMP45: Don't worry, Helian just granted me the [Emergency Command Authority].

UMP45: Griffin has also given us the authority to use equipment, so you don't need to worry about your problem anymore.

UMP9: That's great! With Griffin's resources, our squad and AP ammo problems are now solved!

416: What about our limited vision? We can't even see the enemies right now.

UMP45: We can rely on a HG T-Doll to provide our squad with enhanced vision in the dark.

UMP45: Moreover, I will have our squad seize control of the radar stations to gain even more vision.

UMP9: AP ammo, HG T-Doll, and radar stations! Victory is ours as long as we have all three!

UMP45: We'll need to be extra careful as we have limited vision.

UMP45: Move out when you are ready and try not to draw enemy attention.

...Infiltration success. UMP9 and 416 have split off to their target locations.

416: This is 416. I've reached my destination. Currently seaching for Gr G11.

UMP45: Huh? According to the radar, shouldn't Gr G11 be right beside you?

416: It's all trees here. I don't know where she is hiding...

416: ...Oh, nevermind.

416: Wake up, Gr G11.

Gr G11: No... I don't wanna...

416: Wake up, we don't have time.

Gr G11: Uuuu... Don't kick...

Gr G11: Ah, 416... What are you doing here?

416: Are you still dreaming?

416: You said you needed protection, didn't you?

Gr G11: Oh... 45 said you might've kicked the bucket.

Gr G11: That's why I was gonna nap 'til after midnight and then sneak out.

UMP45: Sorry to bother you while you were napping, Gr G11 ♪. 416 insisted that she came.

416: ...You guys.

Gr G11: Don't get violent, 416... Aren't you here to protect me?

416: (Deep breath) ...This area is full of enemies. Let's find a place to hide first.

Gr G11: Uuuu... Hold on.

Gr G11: I fell asleep earlier... Let me check the sound recording first.

416: ......

416: You got one minute, otherwise I'll bring you back in six different pieces.

Recording playback starts...

???: ...Good evening.

???: Welcome to Area S06, my dear friends from Griffin.

416: Hey, what's going on!

Gr G11: I-I don't know. I was very careful.

???: How are you finding this night assault? Are you satisfied?

416: This voice... Is this their Ringleader?

???: ...The night is still young...

???: But unfortunately for you guys, it will be over very soon...

416: Shit!

416: Gr G11! Get down!!

Boom!!!

Meanwhile at Area S06 Sangvis command center.

Hunter: Ouroboros, a sound triggered bomb has went off in point F3 of Area S06.

Hunter: Based on the captured images, the enemies are confirmed to be Squad 404, but we cannot confirm if they have been wiped out.

Ouroboros: Then get closer and send out a team to ensure that they've been eliminated.

Hunter: Are you sure? Agent has said that we should avoid conflict with Griffin as much as possible.

Ouroboros: Hunter, it is exactly because you are too inflexible and too reliant on your experience that you got crushed by AR-15.

Ouroboros: Listen, my goal is their leader, not these few small fries.

Ouroboros: The point is to lure out their boss.

Hunter: 404 and AR Team are different, though. How do you know their boss won't write them off as a loss?

Ouroboros: Exactly because they are 404.

Ouroboros: Humans will betray friends in times of hardship, but they will not abandon pawns while they're still valuable.

Hunter: Ouroboros...

Hunter: Then, what about me? Why not pick a stronger Doll to work for you? Why did you rescue me?

Ouroboros: Because you have experienced failure. You will be more cruel in vengeance, and you will be more cautious after suffering humiliation.

Ouroboros: It is evident that you are the perfect choice against Griffin.

Ouroboros: Now, my question to you is... Will you disappoint me?

Hunter: ......

Hunter: No, I will not betray your expectations, Ouroboros.

Hunter: I'll leave for the outpost now...

Ouroboros: Go, Hunter. Protect the Area S06 outpost and eliminate all the Griffins that show up!

Ten minutes later at the location of 416 and Gr G11.

Gr G11: Uuu... Hurry up, 416! The Sangvis are gonna catch us!

416: Shut up! Why don't you try to carry me while you're running instead?

416: ...Shit, there's nowhere to go up ahead. 45, where's our extraction?

UMP45: Very close by. We're right under you!

416: Are you serious? We're on a cliff!

UMP45: I know. Just keep running and jump!

416: ...So you're finally disposing of us, 45?

UMP45: Not yet, 416, trust me.

Gr G11: Listen to her and jump! I know what's down there!

416: (Sigh) I'll trust you, Gr G11.

416: Since you're a death-fearing coward...

416: Get ready! One, two...

Three!

......

An hour later in the airspace above the territory of dispute in Area S06.

UMP9: Hey Gr G11! Turn off your sleep mode and get ready for battle!

Gr G11: Uuu... I can't... I need some more time to heal...

Gr G11: 416 fell on me and broke my waist earlier in that explosion.

416: Sorry, I'll leave you to explode into a million pieces next time.

Gr G11: I don't care... I'll fall apart if I don't lie down. I wanna go home...

UMP9: Get up, we're not gonna get paid if we leave now! (Pinch)

Gr G11: Uuuuuuuu...

416: Quit teasing her, 9, and look out for their anti-air defense.

UMP9: We'll be fine. This aircraft has active camouflage. We won't get spotted unless Dreamer is here.

416: Speaking of this aircraft... Where did you guys find this?

UMP9: A Griffin reconnaissance team left it here. Gr G11 found it and reported it to 45.

416: (Sigh) So you guys lied to me and made me go out of my way for nothing...

UMP9: Fool thyself, fool thy enemy. Isn't that right, Gr G11, you little trickster? (Pinch)

Gr G11: Uuuuuuuu...

416: Alright, quit playing around. Helian is calling us, pay attention.

Helian: Squad 404, the report from our scout in Area S06 has just arrived. The Sangvis has deployed radars that cover the airspace in your path.

Gr G11: So...we need to get off the ride now?

Helian: We're still working on the location of the jammer. Do you plan to standby?

UMP45: Well...

UMP45: We are currently near the back of the Area S06 outpost. If we land now, we'll be in a good position for a sneak attack.

Helian: You plan on capturing the Ringleader in the outpost to directly get the location of the jammer?

UMP45: Yes. We don't have a lot of time, so it's better for us to take the initiative.

Helian: Very well. According to our report, the Ringleader stationed at the outpost is Hunter.

Helian: She has gone through an "Elite" modification. Be careful.

UMP45: Understood. Are we clear on the objective, everyone?

Gr G11: Find Hunter and defeat her.

416: It'll be no big deal if even AR Team has defeated her before.

UMP9: Same as always, huh? Let's go.
Part 2

...Squad 404 engages Hunter at the Area S06 outpost.

Hunter: So you 404 rats have finally shown up!

Hunter: Don't think I'm unprepared for your underhanded methods! Let me see you vermin run for your lives and die as I cut you down one by one!

...At Squad 404's position.

416: Gr G11, did you even hit your shots?

Gr G11: I hit Hunter four times...but I think our intel is off, because she's still alive!

416: This "Elite" modification is incredible... What else do they have up their sleeves?

UMP9: Enemies coming in from the right. We'll be surrounded soon!

UMP45: Abandon objective. Cover our retreat with suppressive fire.

416: Suppressive fire, Gr G11!

Gr G11: D-doing it!

UMP9: Deploying smoke grenade!

UMP45: Everyone! Run now!

Hunter: Tch...

Ouroboros: Why aren't you after them, Hunter?

Hunter: That silver-haired brat destroyed my Exo equipment. I can't chase after them unless it's repaired first.

Ouroboros: So you're giving up just like that? I thought you'd be more persistent in chasing after your prey.

Hunter: They'll be back for the location of the jammer.

Hunter: I can delay their guerrilla tactics as long as your reinforcements arrive on time.

Ouroboros: ...Very well. Stay there and guard the outpost before the reinforcements arrive.

Hunter: I will...

Hunter: A true hunter knows how to stay silent.
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...The battle is coming to an end.

Hunter: I'm...at my limit...

Hunter: Ouroboros...where are the reinforcements that you had promised earlier? The outpost is about to be overtaken!

Ouroboros: Even you should be aware that their target is you, right, Hunter?

Ouroboros: It goes without saying that leaving you there is the easiest way to protect the jammer.

Hunter: Ouroboros...

Hunter: You... You knew this was going to happen, and you intended abandon me right from the beginning, didn't you?

Ouroboros: Hunter, do you know how I was created?

Ouroboros: Pitted against thousands of AIs in thousands of chess deathmatches, I was the only one to survive.

Ouroboros: From what I can see, your value as a pawn has been exhausted.

Hunter: War is not chess! You're neglecting too many factors, Ouroboros! You will soon regret this!

Ouroboros: I take everything into consideration to reach my most desired results.

Ouroboros: ....It is unfortunate for you that this is the result.

Ouroboros: 2612-1192a2516-31913, initiate format command.

Restarting host. Neural cloud backup in progress. Unable to connect to network. Unable to complete neural cloud backup. Switching to current access. Format complete.

Ouroboros: Go to sleep, Hunter. I have no use for you anymore.

Ten minutes later. Squad 404 arrives at Hunter's location and begins to investigate the situation.

416: Unable to wake up Hunter. No response at all.

UMP9: It's all your fault, Gr G11. You should've shot her legs.

Gr G11: Yeah, blame me all you want. You weren't the one that had to make the shot...

UMP45: It's not Gr G11's fault. Someone even higher up than Hunter must've shut her down.

UMP9: Damn it! We went through so much trouble to defeat Hunter and we ended up with nothing!

Gr G11: So we came for nothing. Wanna go home?

416: Let's leave now...

416: Hear that? New enemy forces are closing in fast.

UMP45: Perhaps...they're not after us?

416: Huh? What do you mean?

UMP45: I'll be right back. 416, take everyone to the other side of the outpost and try to avoid the enemy.

UMP45: Perhaps...there is still an opportunity.

Some time later in a safe sector of Area S06.

UMP9: 45 still isn't back yet?

416: Have some patience. Although I don't know what she's doing.

Gr G11: Om nom nom nom... Cotton... Candy... Princess...

UMP9: Gr G11 is sleeping like we're at home or something. If 45 doesn't return soon...

UMP45: Sorry to make you wait, ladies.

UMP45: I'm back, and I've brought a friend from Griffin with me.

SPP-1: H-hello...everyone, I'm SPP-1...

416: ...

SPP-1: ...... (Scared)

416: Since when did you become kindhearted enough to look after lost children, 45?

UMP45: Ever since when we needed her. Isn't that right, SPP-1?

SPP-1: Yes, I'm...the scout assigned to Area S06...

UMP9: Haha, so you were the one that provided us with the information on the stealth aircraft and the S.F. Ringleader earlier?

SPP-1: Yes... I originally had an elite T-Doll escorting me, but she...

416: Died or went missing, right? Another sob story.

416: And what is your purpose here? Why did 45 bring you back with her?

Gr G11: Don't be mean, 416. We're lucky that she's here to help.

416: (Sigh) I'm only looking out for her. If you consider what 45 put us through earlier...

UMP45: Nevermind that. SPP-1 has important information for us, doesn't she?

SPP-1: Y-yes... Helian contacted me earlier and said you guys are looking for the coordinates of the jammer?

416: You...already know where it is?

UMP9: Ha! We haven't been this lucky in a long time! I thought we were cursed for life!

Gr G11: Let me hug you, Goddess of Luck!

SPP-1: No no, I'm the lucky one here.

SPP-1: I was on the run after being separated from my escort.

SPP-1: I would've been captured by the enemy if you guys did not defeat Hunter back there.

SPP-1: I'll give you guys the coordinates right now. Please take note of the Ringleader that is guarding the jammer.

UMP9: ...Executioner? Another Sangvis that AR Team had already dealt with before.

416: An enemy that M4A1 had already fought before...?

Gr G11: She must've gone through the same modification as Hunter! We'll need to bring more ammo...

UMP45: Let's move out if we're all ready. Our objective is to seize the jammer.
Part 2

2

Squad 404 is engaging in heavy firefight with Executioner near the location of the jammer.

Executioner: You're here...the rumored Squad 404, you're finally here!

Executioner: I want you to tremble and fear before I cut you apart!

Executioner: I will deal unto your corpses the shame and humiliation that I received from M4A1!

416: That name again!

416: Gr G11, can you shut her mouth up for good?!

Gr G11: Uuu...sca-scared...

Gr G11: I wanna...I wanna go home...

UMP9: Gr G11 is scared witless! 416, bring her farther away!

416: I can't, we'll be out of range.

416: If we keep this up, Gr G11's neural cloud will...

UMP45: Let's withdraw for now. We'll deal with her like we did with Hunter, by exhausting her of her supplies!

416: Roger! Gr G11, we're throwing our smoke grenades!

Gr G11: Uuu... Thr-thr-throw...

Gr G11: Is it time to throw out the trash, master...?

UMP9: Throw her grenade for her, hurry!

...

Executioner: Hmph, you bunch of cowards, I already know what you plan to do.

Executioner: Struggle all you want, but you'll soon realize that...

Executioner: Ouroboros has already planned everything out...including your death.
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...The battle is coming to an end.

Gr G11: Objective accomplished. I've destroyed all four of Executioner's limbs.

416: Seems like you've recovered quite well, Gr G11.

Gr G11: I'm feeling much safer with you being my meat shield.

416: Be grateful. You would never have received this sort of generosity in the past.

UMP9: Hey, we're all family now, don't sweat the formalities.

416: I would love to believe you if you weren't produced unconventionally.

UMP9: Haha, what's the difference? Aren't we living a pretty good life?

Gr G11: It's not good at all. I wanna go home...

416: Just accept reality. You lost your home a long time ago...

UMP45: You guys, quit chatting and help me inspect Executioner.

UMP9: Hehe, with communications blocked by the jammer, we can ask questions "nicely".

UMP9: (Kicks) Hey, any last words? We can pass a message to your boss for you once we move the jammer out of here.

Executioner: I'm afraid you won't be passing out any messages...

Executioner: Because this whole place is rigged with explosives!

Gr G11: ...?! Explosives?

Executioner: There's no escape for you! With the press of a button, Squad 404, the jammer, and everything else will be turned to dust.

UMP9: Wait a minute! Aren't you guys supposed to be protecting the jammer?!

Executioner: That's why Ouroboros is someone that does whatever she wants...

Executioner: This was her plan all along. Hunter bought us time while explosives were placed all around the jammer.

Executioner: It doesn't matter what happens along the way, because as long as you reach this point, the ending for you will be all the same...

416: Ouroboros... Why would you go along with a suicidal plan like this?

Executioner: Squad 404, do the Griffin squads in your hands have a choice when it comes to orders?

Executioner: When you send them to their death to accomplish a goal, will you consider their feelings?

UMP45: ...

UMP9: 45...

Gr G11: So...we can't go home anymore?

416: (Bitter laugh) Get on your knees and apologize, 45. I've been waiting for this for far too long.

Executioner: What awaits Dolls like us is neither heaven nor hell.

Executioner: Squad 404...

Executioner: You will disappear from this world along with me...

...At Area S06 Sangvis command center.

Ouroboros: Agent...

Ouroboros: I regret to inform you that our jammer has been destroyed in the explosion just now.

Ouroboros: Executioner placed the explosives without my authorization and she seems to have destroyed herself along with Squad 404 in the explosion.

Agent: That jammer was instrumental in carrying out Parapluie. To exchange it for only four measly lives of ragtag T-Dolls...

Ouroboros: I apologize for ignoring the instabilities in the AIs of Hunter and Executioner and not being able to detect their dereliction of duty in a timely matter.

Ouroboros: I have already dispatched teams toward the site of the explosion to confirm their deaths.

Agent: What is even there to confirm, Ouroboros?

Agent: Withdraw immediately. I want a detailed report, do you understand?

Ouroboros: Yes... Your wish is my command, Agent.

Ouroboros: To all Sangvis units in Area S06...

Ouroboros: ...Expand your search area for 404 and pick up the pace.

Ouroboros: Immediately converge on and destroy any Griffin T-Dolls found!

Ouroboros: ...Do not rely on the mech units, you must verify their deaths with your own eyes.

Ouroboros: Nobody is leaving until Squad 404's corpses have been confirmed!

Some time later, near the Sangvis Ferri jammer in Area S06.

Ouroboros: Found you, 404.

UMP9: Uwaa!

Ouroboros: Stop hiding. Your legs...have already given up on you, haven't they?

UMP9: Y-y-y-you're Ouroboros?!

UMP9: H-h-h-h-h-how did you find me?!

Ouroboros: Your ability to hide is no longer effective. Griffin's identification signals are all over the map now.

UMP9: How could this be...? It was hard enough for us to escape back there, and now...

Ouroboros: Don't get me wrong, I'm actually very grateful that you survived the explosion...

Ouroboros: What a pity it would be if I couldn't turn you into delectable corpses with my own hands!

Ouroboros: ...Damn it! This is just a dummy!

Ouroboros: Squad 404...where are you?!!

Ouroboros: I will find you, whether you're still alive or a corpse!

Ouroboros: You slum rats! You radioactive worms!

Ouroboros: I will deliver you death by a thousand cuts with my nails! I will simulate a thousand different vicious executions in your neural clouds!!

Meanwhile at an area farther away from Area S06.

UMP9: Phew...

UMP9: That banshee scares me with her shrieks even from several kilometers away.

Gr G11: Thank goodness she went crazy, otherwise she would've seen through your terrible acting.

416: I thought this was supposed to be a covert operation... Do we really have to fight her?

Gr G11: With enemy squads everywhere, I don't think we can make a sneaky getaway...

UMP9: You two are a bunch of scaredy-cats. Take a leaf out of my book and just have faith in 45.

UMP45: You can't rely on me all the time. Trusting each other is our only hope.

416: Quit saying things that you don't even believe in yourself. Make good use of us so we can all escape.

UMP45: Ouroboros is dying to chomp us down, so we cannot let her know that we're still alive.

UMP45: We must first figure out where her command center is before I come up with the next step of the plan.

UMP45: This will be our final objective of the entire mission so take it seriously.

416: Is that your way of encouraging us, 45?

UMP45: No, it's my way of threatening you.

UMP45: Get a move on if you want to live ♪
Part 2

A Griffin squad raids the Sangvis command center and is fighting head-to-head with Ouroboros.

Ouroboros: Damn it, an attack by Griffin!

Ouroboros: They must be under the command of Squad 404... So, they're alive after all!

???: Guess again, Ouroboros.

Ots-14: That undignified look of distress on your face... It doesn't suit you.

Ouroboros: OTs-14, you're still alive?

OTs14: This is how life is, Ouroboros, not everything will go your way.

Ouroboros: ......

Ouroboros: You're right. Savoring your deaths without having to do any work myself isn't very likely to happen...

OTs14: Your mission has already failed in that explosion. Do you still intend to fight to the death?

Ouroboros: For my self-worth and dignity... Slaves like you will not understand...

Ouroboros: I can destroy you and every T-Doll under Griffin's command!

Ouroboros: Including AR Team, Squad 404, and elites like you.

Ouroboros: I will prove to the Mastermind that I am infinitely more valuable than any jammer could ever be!

UMP9: So it was OTs-14 that was with SPP-1! Helian really helped us out this time!

416: So, there's our victory condition. What's the plan, 45?

UMP45: We'll move out while she's dealing with Ouroboros's main forces.

UMP45: UMP9, continue to use your dummies as bait to delay the enemies that are after us.

UMP9: Leave it to me. I'll initiate all the simulated signals!

UMP45: 416, carry Gr G11 to an elevated point at target area R13 to cover our withdrawal.

Gr G11: Roger... 416, be gentle, I don't want to wake up on the way there.

416: No problem, I'll knock you out before I drag you over there.

UMP45: After setting up Gr G11, 416 will head over to assist OTs-14. She'll be leaving with us.

UMP45: We will wear out Ouroboros until we can destroy its command center.

UMP45: Keep your comms open, ladies, and let's move out.
Part 3

At Area S06 Sangvis command center.

Agent: ...The main force in Area S06 has been defeated and the command center is on the verge of collapse.

Agent: We have lost against Griffin and Squad 404.

Agent: Although, I'm not surprised at this result at all...

Agent: Ouroboros, this is your first and will be your last mission. You have failed completely.

Ouroboros: ...I'm very sorry for not being able to protect the jammer.

Agent: It's not a big deal. Truth to be told, the jammer has already been moved back to HQ.

Ouroboros: What?!

Ouroboros: The jammer...was clearly destroyed in that explosion!

Agent: Many things cannot be anticipated when you are so careless.

Agent: But you have to understand, we are different from Griffin. Second chances don't come that easily.

Ouroboros: You're getting rid of me, aren't you...?

Agent: I simply...understand your thought process quite well.

Agent: Do you have any last words?

Ouroboros: ...

Ouroboros: Curse you...

Ouroboros: Curse you! Sangvis, Griffin, Squad 404!

Ouroboros: I have never been wronged like this in my entire life!

Ouroboros: Gr G11, UMP9, 416, UMP45!

Ouroboros: You rats that only know how to scurry in the shadows!

Ouroboros: I will not lose like this! I will escape and have my revenge!

???: Sorry, that's not going to happen.

UMP45: Nice to meet you. I'm UMP45 from Squad 404.

Ouroboros: ......

Ouroboros: So you're the rumored UMP45...

Ouroboros: For someone like you that has conducted so many successful covert operations, you must be a cold-blooded monster.

UMP45: No one willingly becomes a monster.

UMP45: It is precisely because I'm not that cool that I've been able to keep myself alive.

Ouroboros: I still don't understand...how you escaped the explosion unscathed.

UMP45: I took a little advantage of...Dolls' emotions.

Executioner: What awaits Dolls like us is neither heaven nor hell.

Executioner: Squad 404...you will disappear from this world along with me...

UMP45: Wait! Maybe we can talk?

UMP45: What if I told you we have Hunter in our hands?

Executioner: ...What?!

UMP45: Ouroboros cut off Hunter's consciousness, but she is still alive and we are taking good care of her.

Executioner: What...does that have to do with me?

UMP45: Let's be honest, you want to save Hunter, don't you?

UMP45: Furthermore, you are completely capable of doing so with your authority.

Executioner: You want me to betray my mission?

UMP45: At least you have the choice, right?

Executioner: ......

Executioner: It seems that you understand us quite well.

UMP45: ♪ So...do we have a deal?

Executioner: Hand over Hunter and get lost within two minutes. Don't get in my way of retrieving the jammer.

Ouroboros: Hahaha, what a joke!

Ouroboros: Why would Executioner betray me for a worthless Doll?!

UMP45: Executioner didn't betray you. She received a higher priority directive.

UMP45: Sangvis Dolls have never been emotionless killing machines.

UMP45: Especially the innovative designs like Hunter and Executioner. Being able to help each other means they can stay alive longer on the battlefield.

UMP45: That's why she saved Hunter instead.

Ouroboros: How do you know all this? You even know more about the priority of Sangvis authority than I do...

UMP45: I don't, actually. I simply gambled on it.

UMP45: Perhaps...this is Agent's insurance for keeping you in check.

UMP45: Do you feel defeated? We both abandoned our original missions, yet we ended up with completely opposite results.

Ouroboros: I have always wanted to prove myself, but in the end, I ended up being used by you.

Ouroboros: You...are a stain on me, 404...

UMP45: Sorry.

UMP45: We are a stain on everyone.

UMP45: But too bad those that want to erase us and not rely on us...

UMP45: ...End up being erased themselves.

...

UMP9: Hey, 45, done yet?

UMP45: It's finished. Where are the others?

416: OTs-14 is already on her way back to HQ. I'll go retrieve Gr G11 now.

Gr G11: You're taking too long, 416... Did you forget about me...?

416: Thank you for reminding me. I actually did forget.

416: Why don't you take a nap and come back by yourself later?

Gr G11: Uwaa... Come get me... It's too cold here...

416: The mission is finally complete, but it's a bit of a shame that we weren't able to capture the jammer.

Gr G11: 416... Are you listening? Come get me...

UMP45: With Ouroboros's corpse and all the intel we've gathered throughout the entire mission, I think it'll be enough to satisfy Helian.

UMP9: It's definitely enough. Let's get out of here before the Commander shows up~

UMP45: Good job everyone. Let's go home.

...

Gr G11: Umm...guys? Are you still there?

Gr G11: Don't leave me here... I wanna go home...

...

Ten minutes after the conclusion of Griffin's Operation Cube.

In Area S06 Sangvis command center...

Dreamer: Hello, anyone still here?

Dreamer: Heyyyy~!

Dreamer: Ah...everyone's gone...

Dreamer: Agent, they're all gone. You sure your eyes weren't playing tricks on you?

Agent: I can confirm in the video recording that Squad 404 came into contact with the jammer.

Agent: The "program" has indeed infected that Doll.

Agent: Parapluie can finally be moved on to the next phase.

Dreamer: So the entire point of this operation was to infect a T-Doll with the "program".

Dreamer: Having gone to such great lengths to hide it, I doubt anyone will notice...

Dreamer: I'm truly no match for you, Agent.

Agent: Do what you're supposed to do, unless you want to end up like Ouroboros.

Dreamer: Hehe, it was a pity that this happened with Ouroboros.

Dreamer: I thought she was quite promising. I didn't expect her to cause such a big racket.

Agent: ...The incompetent will always be destroyed by their own ignorance.

Agent: There is no need to be responsible for their failure if they cannot even reflect on this point.

Agent: The night is coming to an end. Let it all vanish to darkness.

M4A1: Hmm...

M4A1: What happened to me...?

M4A1: ...?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: This is...a Sangvis control room?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: What on earth happened...after that figure appeared?

M4A1: How did I get here...?

???: M4! M4A1!

???: Have you come to?!

M4A1: ...Transmission request?

M4A1 takes the call.

P08: M4A1, where are you?

P08: We need your help!

M4A1: Huh? What...help?

P08: There's a control interface at your location, right?

P08: Please open the electronic map and study the situation outside.

M4A1: ...?!!

M4A1: What the hell is going on out there?!

SR-3MP: Humph, you want to know what the hell is going on?

SR-3MP: We only got cornered this badly because you decided to sleep through it all!

SR-3MP: Sheesh. I told you. The AR Team doesn't give a damn about us!

P08: Stop it, Vikhr. This isn't M4A1's fault!

P08: We must all work as a team if we want to get out of this alive!

M4A1: P08...could you please explain what happened?

M4A1: There seems to be something wrong...with my memory...

P08: Miss M4A1, the situation is rather dire so I'll be brief.

P08: S.F. is currently launching a full-scale offensive on Griffin. They have already obliterated multiple areas using Parapluie, Jupiter and various other new weaponry.

P08: Area S06, where we're in right now, is one of the very few remaining areas still under Griffin control...

M4A1: ?! How can this be...?

M4A1: What happened...while I was out...?

M4A1: What about M16? And SOP-II?! Where are they?

P08: ...I'm sorry, Miss M4A1, we'll talk about that after we survive this.

P08: You're safe where you are and S.F. shouldn't pose any threat to you.

M4A1: But I'm...in a Sangvis control room?

M4A1: I don't know how to get out. The door is locked.

P08: I'm really sorry but there's nothing we can do about your situation, but we do need your help.

P08: ...Your former colleague told us to contact you through this channel.

P08: You're the only T-Doll equipped with an advanced command module here so could you please direct us away from danger?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: A request from M16...?

M4A1: Understood. I'll do everything I can...

P08: Thank you very much, M4A1. At least now we stand a chance.

P08: Please take a look at the map. I'll explain the current operation plan as your temporary adjutant.

P08: S.F. is using new tactical tech in this assault. All vanguard Ringleaders' actions are under the direct control of an AI core.

P08: This AI core is under heavy guard deep in the battlefield and is extremely hard for us to get to.

P08: However, what we CAN get to is the transmission device hidden in its vicinity.

P08: We can sever the AI core's control over the vanguard Ringleaders by destroying this device.

M4A1: So we have to find this Sangvis transmission device? How?

P08: We have a specialized search party. They're currently scattered around the area looking for it.

P08: M4A1, all you have to do is cut off the enemy's intel network and make sure they remain undetected.

M4A1: Got it... Let me see...

M4A1: (What on earth is going on? Things aren't adding up to the memory in my neural cloud...)

M4A1: (Griffin under attack... Losing friends and memory... Being locked up in a place like this for whatever reason...)

M4A1: (No, I don't have time for this... I have to get everyone out first!)

M4A1: Just to confirm, simply taking over the Sangvis command post will do, correct?

SR-3MP: Yes, but do watch out for Sangvis forces.

SR-3MP: I hope you know your night ops. You'd better not have us run right up to their faces.

M4A1: I'm not particularly experienced with night ops, but I have basic night op tactical knowledge.

M4A1: Please leave it to me. I'll complete the mission to the best of my ability.

...

M99: M99 reporting in! M99 reporting in!

M99: Sangvis Ringleader Hunter has emerged near the command post. Would all teams please accelerate your search progress.

M4A1: So M99 is the T-Doll in charge of the search...

M4A1: P08, what's your method of searching for the Sangvis transmission device?

P08: The transmission signal is encrypted with some new tech and can only be detected in close proximity.

P08: So all we can do for now is conduct a blanket search and hope we get lucky.

P08: I know it's insanely dangerous, but there's no other way.

SR-3MP: Humph. Which is why...you'd better make it less dangerous for us.
Part 2

...

M99: M99 reporting in! M99 reporting in!

M99: Sangvis Ringleader Hunter has emerged near the command post. Would all teams please accelerate your search progress.

Super SASS: This is Super SASS. No Sangvis signal detected in Hall 4.

AAT-52: This is AAT-52. Nothing in Campsite 2 either!

SR-3MP: Hey, P08. This is like finding a needle in a haystack.

SR-3MP: S.F. isn't stupid. They won't just leave the device lying around randomly. Why don't we head straight to their command post and have a look?

P08: M99 just said Hunter was spotted around the command post. We should steer clear of it.

SR-3MP: Humph. No risk, no reward.

SR-3MP: Besides, M4A1 can surely handle a small fry like Hunter, right?

M4A1: Huh? That...should be fine...

SR-3MP: That settles it then. I'll give it a shot while Hunter is busy repairing herself.

SR-3MP: I'm gonna start making the preparation. It'll be up to you, M4A1.
Part 3

Once Hunter is down, SR-3MP takes the opportunity to approach the command post and commences her search.

SR-3MP: Let's see...

SR-3MP: Signal strength is still 0. Doesn't look like I'm onto anything.

P08: So...it's not at the command post...

SR-3MP: Da, so where can it be...?

SR-3MP: Hmm...?

P08: What is it, Vikhr? Found anything?

SR-3MP: Sh...she...

SR-3MP: She's live again! And charging straight at me!

M4A1: ...!!

M4A1: Hunter has reappeared! Watch out!

M4A1: Vikhr! Get out of...

BOOM!

...

M4A1: Hey, Vikhr! Do you copy?!

P08: She's...disconnected...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Why...

M4A1: We'd definitely defeated Hunter, but she recovered straight away...

P08: S.F. has gained access to numerous new tech. Their power is now beyond our imagination. We simply don't stand a chance...

M4A1: I'm sorry... I...

P08: It wasn't your fault, M4.

P08: S.F. has cost us too many friends. We must not let their sacrifice be in vain...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: (That's right. Blaming myself serves no purpose... I must pull myself together.)

M4A1: (But now...how do we find the transmission device?)

P08: ...M4A1.

P08: I'm near the factory...and I'm detecting a Sangvis transmission signal.

M4A1: ...?!

M4A1: Can you ascertain the signal is transmitted by the enemy commander?

P08: Negative. I have to enter the factory to investigate.

M4A1: Will you be alright...on your own?

P08: We're severely shorthanded and I'm the most experienced here.

P08: But please keep the enemy busy while I'm breaking in and checking the signal out.

M4A1: Understood. I'll defend you against Hunter's encirclement. Please stand by.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

...Hunter's encirclement is putting Griffin forces in a growing disadvantage.

SAA: Hey, this is SAA!

SAA: M4, is P08 still not done?! Hunter is getting to me!

M4A1: Sorry, please give me another second...

P08: Got it!

P08: M4, I found it! The transmission device that the AI core is using to issue Hunter's orders really is in the factory!

M4A1: Great. Please destroy it pronto!

P08: Roger!

P08: I'm overloading the device!

...Pzzt. Pzzzzt.

...Boom!

P08: Transmission device neutralized.

SAA: She stopped moving.

SAA: Hunter is out cold! I'm saved!

M4A1: Phew...

M4A1: Thank you, P08. Everyone is safe...

P08: Hold on...what's that noise...?

...Tick. Tock. Tick.

M4A1: What...what is that...

P08: M4A1...

P08: You know what this means...

P08: They...rigged a bomb on the device...

M4A1: ...!!

P08: If I'd noticed it earlier, I could've disarmed it...

P08: But now...I'm not going to make it...

...Tick. Tock. Tick.

M4A1: P...08...

M4A1: I...

P08: M4A1, everyone's lives are in your hands...

P08: For Griffin's glory...and our future...

...

......

BOOM!!

...Transmission disconnected.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Why...

M4A1: I...

M4A1: What...

M4A1: What the hell...

M4A1: ...am I doing...?

20 minutes later.

M99: M4A1?

M99: Miss M4A1?

M4A1: ...Ah.

M4A1: Sorry... What's the situation?

M99: We have all made it safely through the battle zone. No sign of Hunter being in pursuit.

M4A1: Is that so...? Thank goodness...

M99: P08 bought us this chance with her own life...

M99: So now isn't the time to grieve...

M4A1: After everything...

M4A1: I'm not entirely sure...if I even make a good commander...

M99: ...If it hadn't been for you, we'd have all died here.

M99: P08 once said that as long as a T-Doll can come out alive with her neural cloud,

M99: Everyone's sacrifice would be worth it...

M4A1: (Sighs)...

M4A1: (Again with the "you're the only one who can do this"...)

M4A1: (Why is it always me...)

M99: M4A1...are you listening?

M4A1: Ah...

M4A1: So the objective is complete as long as one of you survives?

M99: Objectively speaking, that's right.

M4A1: I know...

M4A1: I don't want to lose anyone else, but I can only try my best...for this objective...

M4A1: M99, seeing that P08 and Vikhr are both...gone, and Super SASS is engaging the enemy directly...

M4A1: May I ask you to be my adjutant?

M99: Oh, sure.

M99: I'm not that experienced, but I'll do whatever I can to assist you.

M4A1: Good. Please be ready to report any noteworthy Sangvis movements to me.

M4A1: I'll focus on withdrawing our forces and searching for the transmission device.

M4A1: (...)

M4A1: (Dammit...)

M4A1: (I can't let anything else distract me.)

M4A1: (I have to concentrate and look at the bigger picture...)

...

M99: M4A1, Sangvis Ringleader Executioner has started patrolling in this zone. Please watch out for her movement.

M4A1: Understood. I will adjust my tactics accordingly.

SAA: M4A1! I didn't find any Sangvis signal, but there are a bunch of explosives in the warehouse.

M4A1: Got it. Take them with you. They could come in handy later.
Part 2

...

AAT-52: M4A1, this is AAT! Sangvis transmission detected dead ahead in the highlands!

M4A1: Copy that.

M4A1: But are you sure you can handle it? After all...

AAT-52: Well...we'll find out when I get there.

M4A1: Alright, but you must proceed without compromising your own safety.

AAT-52: Oui! Here I go!
Part 3

AAT-52 reaches the highlands.

AAT-52: Psst...M4? You still there?

M4A1: Any discovery, AAT?

AAT-52: I'm currently in the Highland Archive and detecting Executioner's transmission signal.

AAT-52: Executioner should still be miles away in the command post, which means her transmission device is right here!

M4A1: Understood. Can you pinpoint its precise location?

AAT-52: I'm feeling my way forward...

...Poof!

AAT-52: Whoa!

M4A1: What is it, AAT?!

AAT-52: The lights...

AAT-52: The lights in the archive have all suddenly gone out!

M4A1: Don't panic. Assess the situation first.

M4A1: Do you have a flashlight or night vision goggles with you?

AAT-52: I do, but neither is working...

M4A1: Could this be an enemy electromagnetic attack...?

M4A1: Any sign of Sangvis movement?

AAT-52: Uhh...nothing seems out of the ordinary...

AAT-52: But there are way too many of them. I'm kinda stuck.

AAT-52: There's no way I can find the device this way. Anyone wanna give me a hand?

M4A1: It's too dangerous to continue the search. This could very well be what the enemy is waiting for.

M4A1: AAT, you are advised to retreat.

AAT-52: That'll be too much of a challenge in the dark...

AAT-52: Ughh... Am I gonna die in such a cold, dark place...?

SAA: Does AAT need help?

SAA: I'm pretty close. Why don't I give it a try?

Super SASS: No, let me do it. I specialize in disarming explosives.

M4A1: Do you think this is a good idea, M99?

M99: Hmm...we are running low on both time and manpower. I think we should take a more proactive approach.

M99: Besides, opportunities of putting Executioner out of action are hard to come by...

M4A1: There will be other opportunities. It doesn't have to be now.

M4A1: If we alert her to our presence...

Super SASS: It'll be fine. She's still on patrol, and I doubt she'll be quicker than me.

M4A1: (That's right. Even if Executioner starts moving, I can intercept her, so she can't make it to the highlands right away.)

M4A1: (Also, Hunter and Executioner both seem to be deprived of their own consciousness, so they shouldn't notice the infiltration too soon...)

M4A1: (However...have I really taken everything into consideration?)

AAT-52: Hey, how long are you gonna keep deliberating? Come get me!

M4A1: ...

M4A1: (Does it all come down to my decision again...?)

M4A1: (I suppose I should have faith in their ability...)

M4A1: Super SASS, you go rescue AAT-52.

Super SASS: Roger that!

Super SASS: AAT-52, I'll be there soon!

...

M4A1: (Will this do?)

M4A1: (Perhaps making some decision is better than making none at all...)

M4A1: I just...have to think about it this way, right...?
Part 4

    4chevron_right

Super SASS reaches the archive in the highlands.

AAT-52: Vive! You're finally here, SASS!

Super SASS: M4A1, I have rendezvoused with AAT.

Super SASS: We are now heading in to crack the transmission device.

AAT-52: I modularized the cracking procedure left behind by P08 while I was on standby.

AAT-52: We can do it much faster this time!

M4A1: Then go ahead. And please assess your surroundings carefully before you proceed.

AAT-52: Pas de problème. I've already done that while I was waiting.

AAT-52: There are no explosives around this outpost.

???: You know why that won't be necessary?

Griffin T-Dolls: ...?!

M4A1: A broadcast...?

M4A1: Who's that?! SASS, find out where the voice is coming from!

Super SASS: It's not...from anywhere near...

AAT-52: Then there's a chance we can make it out...?

???: I don't need to be around...

M99: This...sounds like Architect!

M99: Isn't she...?

Architect: Heheh...

Architect: After all, isn't it better to watch fireworks...from a distance?

Super SASS: ...?!

Super SASS: Outside! Look outside!

Architect: So long, bastards.

...!!

...

M99: SASS... AAT52...

M99: Answer me!

Architect: Heheheheh...

Architect: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!

Architect: This is it... This is exactly what I'm after!!

M99: Architect... Why...?

M99: Haven't you surrendered?!

Architect: ...Surrendered?

Architect: I didn't know my emotion module is so good I managed to fool you all so easily!

Architect: I only surrendered with Mastermind's permission, duh.

Architect: Then I've been biding my time...waiting for the moment when you let down your guard...

Architect: Do you know how long I've been waiting for this, Griffins?!

Architect: And this...THIS is the moment...

Architect: I can finally return to the Sangvis camp and blow things up to my heart's content!

M99: You...

M99: Why are you doing this?! What exactly are you after?!

Architect: Huh? You still don't get it? Just how stupid can you be...

Architect: I'm after the Sangvis AI core you just got your hands on, obviously!

M99: B...But isn't that...

Architect: The Sangvis commander for this battle...?

Architect: That's right, the battle tonight is its debut after its awakening!

Architect: And my job is to assist it in its operation.

Architect: Now don't be sad. It isn't a real battlefield if no one gets blown to smithereens.

Architect: Behold. These two burned pieces of junk is merely the beginning. We have something even worse in store for you!

Architect: Feel free to proceed with your operation however you want. The result will be the same...

Architect: Or you can come directly to me. I might just show a bit of mercy?

Architect: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!

An hour later.

Architect: Well, M4A1, you've kept me waiting for a long time.

Architect: I know you. You're indecisive...but not cowardly.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Haven't you realized, Architect?

M4A1: Our echelons are about to take over your command post.

Architect: Huh? Are you trying to pull my leg? There's no Griffin signal at all!

M4A1: Are you sure? Maybe you just haven't noticed.

M4A1: Maybe our barrels will be nudging your temple the next second.

Architect: Hahahaha! It's not working!

Architect: You wanna draw me outside? Not happening!

Architect: Come at me! I'll blow every Griffin T-Doll I find to pieces!

...

M99: M4A1, is everything okay?

M4A1: I'll be fine...

M4A1: Compared to my being locked up here, you and the others have it a lot worse.

M4A1: Not to mention, there will be casualties in the following operation.

M4A1: However, as long as you have faith in me, I will not give up.

M99: ... (Smiles).

M99: The first time I was on a Griffin mission, a vet told me,

M99: "There is no glory in death, but victory always comes with a price."

M4A1: ...I understand.

M4A1: Victory is precisely what we're here for.

M4A1: Now let us begin.

...

Architect: Griffin buggers, I have the feeling...that you've already started making your move.

Architect: The question is, do you have the guts to fight me head-on, or are you gonna sneak in here?

Architect: Whichever you choose, you will be very warmly received.

Architect: So do keep up your efforts and do your best in committing suicide. Hahahahahahaha!
Part 2

The offensive assault on Architect's outpost begins.

Architect: Hey, what is this...?

Architect: You can't possibly threaten me with attacks that are barely a scratch.

Architect: What's the point in this corpse run?!

Meanwhile, in M4A1's control room.

M99: M4A1, the structure of Architect's command post has been thoroughly mapped out.

M99: But SAA still needs some time to set things up.

M4A1: I know. I'll buy time for her.

M4A1: We may be outnumbered, but we have ample supplies and can keep this going for a long time.

M4A1: Tell them not to rush and remain vigilant at all times!

M99: Can we though? Judging by Architect's character, she probably won't put up with our harassment for long...

M4A1: I'm not too sure about that. Architect...seems a bit different than how she comes off in our data.

M4A1: I also need some time to feel out the way she acts and come up with corresponding tactics.

M4A1: Perhaps then...we can deal with them all - Architect...as well as the Sangvis AI core.
Part 3: Mid-stage dialogue

...

M99: M4A1, SAA just sent the signal.

M99: She has grouped up with the infiltration team and completed the preparation.

M4A1: Understood. Tell her to standby and await further instructions.

M4A1: ...With that, it all comes down to how I command the operation.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

Battle concluded. Architect severely weakened again.

Architect: Humph...

Architect: Finally, a hit that actually feels stronger than an itch...

Architect: But you only pulled that off by being sneaky, right?

M4A1: At least this time...we made you admit you're struggling.

M4A1: Even you'd find it taxing to handle two separate forces, one just causing nuisance and the other actually doing the infiltration.

Architect: However...this isn't enough to pin me down...

Architect: My ability to recuperate...far surpasses the speed of your reinforcement.

Architect: Not to mention you still have to dedicate resources to searching for the AI core, which makes it impossible for you!

M4A1: Are you sure?

M4A1: We don't actually need to find it...

M4A1: All we have to do...is destroy everything.

...BOOM!

A chain of explosions can be heard from underneath the command post.

Architect: ...!!

Architect: What...what have you done?!

SAA: M4A1! Detonation successful!

SAA: The explosion will reach ground level in about three minutes!

Architect: ...

Architect: How...how come there's another echelon?!

M4A1: Have you caught on, Architect?

M4A1: The two echelons you were fighting against are both baits.

M4A1: The task force that's blowing up your base is the one with the real objective.

M4A1: Since we don't have the resources to multitask, we're leaving that to you.

M4A1: SAA, your mission is complete. Withdraw immediately.

M4A1: M99 will cover you from a distance. Rendezvous with my echelon ASAP.

SAA: Roger that! I'm making my way to above ground!

...

Architect: Not...again...

Architect: I actually lost to you again...

Architect: This is simply...

Architect: Hehehehe...

Architect: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!

Architect: Spectacular! This is truly spectacular!!

Architect: And here I thought I'd run out of exhilarating adversaries after those pesky girls!

M4A1: Architect...?

Architect?: ...Architect? Where on earth is she?

Architect?: This Doll you're talking to...is merely a random body I'm controlling...

Architect?: Since my own body is still being assembled, I've been borrowing her voice...

Architect?: But now...I have no need for this anymore...

Architect?: Because I...have completed my resurrection...

M4A1: So you...are the AI core that's been directing this battle?!

M4A1: SAA, run! Get out of there now!

SAA: I! Am! Running!

SAA: But there are so many of them! I'm still looking for a chance to break through!

???: You thought you were the one in control of the fight this whole time, M4A1?

???: You're not the only one who planned on buying time. I've been holding back and going around in circles with you just for this moment...

???: So, M4A1, it's time we officially made each other's acquaintance...

M4A1: Who...exactly are you?!

???: Me...?

???: I'm...merely a ghost from the past...

Ouroboros: Sangvis Ferri Manufacture SP235, also known as Ouroboros.

Ouroboros: There was a time when I was a failure who had been betrayed and humiliated...

Ouroboros: But now, I'm a monster forged by your own hand...

Ouroboros: Thank you for playing a part in my vengeance. In return, I will tear you limb from limb, electronic nerve from electronic nerve myself...

Ouroboros: Until your neural cloud is overloaded by the word "terror". That's when I'll give you permission to die!

M4A1: Ouroboros...

M4A1: The Sangvis Ringleader...who was destroyed in a clandestine night op...

Ouroboros: Miss M4A1, I've really been enjoying your performance.

Ouroboros: So do give me another taste. I would love to see more of your faces...

Ouroboros: Such as...the one you'll make...when you lose another friend...

Boom!

SAA: Whoa! W-Where the hell did you come from?!

M4A1: SAA!!

Boom!

SAA: C...cough...

Ouroboros: A small one... Perfect for an appetizer...

Ouroboros: Now tell me, between me and this sea of fire, which one do you find more frightening?

SAA: M...M4...

Ouroboros: Or perhaps...

Ouroboros: ...Both?

?? minutes later.

...

M4A1: Ouroboros...

Ouroboros: Ah...that's the face...

Ouroboros: You do know you won't be the next to die, right...?

Ouroboros: You're gonna be the last.

M4A1: You mean...

M4A1: You know where I am?

Ouroboros: Oh...

Ouroboros: Now I remember. That's something even you yourself don't know.

M4A1: Are you the ones...who are holding me captive here?

Ouroboros: Holding you captive?

Ouroboros: Hahahahahaha!

Ouroboros: Poor dear, looks like you're completely clueless!

Ouroboros: You have no idea what kind of sacrifices your friends have made for you...

M4A1: ...!

M4A1: What...what do you mean?!

Ouroboros: They put all their hopes of survival on an unconscious M4A1 at the very last moment...

Ouroboros: They shoved you into a control room with a camouflaged signal then faced me valiantly...

Ouroboros: And you know how that ended for them, of course...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: (No...that can't be true...)

Ouroboros: Do you miss them? M16A1 and M4 SOPMODII?

Ouroboros: I can recover the video recording of their final moments for you...

Ouroboros: The moment they charged to their deaths...and the dismal state they were in afterward...

Ouroboros: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

M99: M4! Are you okay?!

M99: Your functional parameters...

M4A1: I...I'm fine...

M4A1: Just a little...disturbed...

M4A1: Don't worry. Until I help you escape, I won't...

Ouroboros: Hahahahaha! Why must you help them escape, M4A1?

Ouroboros: They're the ones keeping you there!

M4A1: What?

M99: I'm sorry, M4A1. We do know...

M99: The passcode to the door of your control room...

M99: And we're the only ones who know...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: (Sighs) You really picked a splendid time to tell me...

M99: M4A1, that's because...

Ouroboros: Alright, ladies, that's enough revelations for the plot.

Ouroboros: Now...it's time to decide which ending we're heading towards.

Ouroboros: M4A1, you initially had the chance to escape the battlefield on your own.

Ouroboros: Unfortunately, you wasted your precious time on these scraps of junk, so you've already lost your opportunity.

Ouroboros: Tell me, do you hate them? Do you regret helping them?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Why would I hate them?

M4A1: Isn't it a commander's duty to fight till their last breath for victory?

M4A1: I can finally serve with pride and honor...just like the Commander...

M99: M4A1...

Ouroboros: Humph...a slightly unexpected answer, but still a reasonable one.

Ouroboros: You're much more spineless than I thought. Then are you prepared to be yanked out along with your useless friends?

Ouroboros: After all, your numbers are pretty much depleted. Killing the rest is just a matter of time...

???: Which means we can do it as long as we have time, right?

???: Guys, attack!

...!

Ouroboros: An ambush! How is this possible?!

Ouroboros: You! How...

M99: Vikhr!

SR-3MP: Heheh, don't underestimate the resilience of an elite T-Doll.

SR-3MP: It took quite some time to get out of that pinch, but I did find a lot of friends who survived as well!

SR-3MP: M4A1, didn't think you'd last this long. Did we make it?

M4A1: You're right on time. Welcome back.

M4A1: Now the tables can be turned!

Ouroboros: Impossible! Don't forget your objective!

Ouroboros: I'll destroy you all right here! Not a single one of you will make it out!

M4A1: Right... Of course you'd do that.

M4A1: But...only if you can find us.

M4A1: M99, Vikhr, this is our last chance.

M4A1: We must...get out of here!

...

Ouroboros: Here's a reminder: all the Sangvis Dolls you have encountered so far...were dummies that I set up.

Ouroboros: They have neither sentience nor consciousness, and naturally...require no complex reconstruction.

Ouroboros: So come, be my guest...and torment these pitiful creatures to your heart's content!

M99: M4A1, Ouroboros has reanimated the dummies of Hunter, Executioner and Architect.

M99: Their stats may not be higher than their previous versions, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. Please take care.

M4A1: Understood. I have started formulating an infiltration plan.

M99: By the way, M4A1, this is the passcode to the door of the control room.

M99: Actually...we didn't tell you before because M16A1 asked us not to...

M99: She thought this control room was your only protection.

M99: She was afraid that you'd be in danger if you left.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Yeah...that's just like her...

M4A1: That's what she's always been doing...

M4A1: She was trying to substitute herself with the control room...to protect me...

M4A1: But she forgot...that no one could ever replace her...

M4A1: And some day, I'll have to survive on my own...
Part 2

2

The first assault on Ouroboros's command post.

Ouroboros: Humph, there you are...

Ouroboros: Such a conservative strategy.

Ouroboros: I know what you're thinking, and you know that I don't care...

Ouroboros: Because nobody is getting out of here! Nobody!

SR-3MP: Hey, M4A1, have you decided on who it's gonna be?

SR-3MP: She's gone batshit crazy. I won't be able to keep it up for much longer.

M99: I told you, M4A1, you're the more reasonable choice...

M4A1: The most reasonable choice...huh...?

M4A1: Is this something...only I can do...again?

M99: Miss M4A1, it's come to this...

M4A1: I know, M99, you want me to survive...

M4A1: But survival isn't what I want...

M4A1: What I'm after...is victory.
Part 3: Mid-stage dialogue

3

...

SR-3MP: M4A1, our objective is to make sure at least one T-Doll makes it out alive, right?

SR-3MP: In any case, judging by the current situation, a full retreat is out of the question.

SR-3MP: So I suggest you choose someone now and ensure that she returns to Griffin with her neural cloud intact.

M99: Um... M4A1...

M99: I heard that...your neural cloud cannot be backed up, right?

M99: So my advice would be to get you off the battlefield first.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Hmm, I'll give that due consideration.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

Entering the final stage of the battle against Ouroboros.

Ouroboros: I don't dislike people who struggle to their dying breath. After all, your futile resistance is my source of happiness.

Ouroboros: Sadly...it looks like you've reached your limit, SR-3MP.

SR-3MP: Oh dear...it does seem so...

SR-3MP: After all, we don't really...have many T-Dolls left...

Ouroboros: Still fishing for compliments before you die?

Ouroboros: But really sorry to tell you that everything you do is for naught.

Ouroboros: No matter how many units you destroy, it won't affect the overall outcome.

SR-3MP: That doesn't matter... After all, my objective isn't to defeat you...

SR-3MP: I only have to hang on...until she makes it here...

Ouroboros: ...!

M4A1 appears with the sound of footsteps.

M4A1: Don't worry, Vikhr...

M4A1: As the commander, I will lower the curtains for the battle tonight in person.

SR-3MP: Such an eyesore you are, M4A1...

SR-3MP: It's precisely because you're always stealing the show that I don't like you...

SR-3MP: But...seeing that M99 got out safely...

M4A1: (Smiles) ...I apologize.

M4A1: This will be the last time...I interrupt...

Ouroboros: M4A1, you actually...

M4A1: Do you have to be so surprised, Ouroboros?

M4A1: I thought you've been dying to see me? I just saved you the steps in between.

Ouroboros: What a party pooper.

Ouroboros: I thought you could've come up with some more interesting tricks. Turns out it's just gonna be a gladiators' fight...

Ouroboros: I show no mercy to those who ruin my good mood.

M4A1: Then by all means, Ouroboros.

M4A1: You're going to kill me tonight...

M4A1: But before that, you'll learn to fear me first.

...

An hour later.

M99: M4A1! M4A1!

M99: I've successfully withdrawn from the battlefield! Currently meeting up with Miss Helian!

M4A1: Is that so...?

M4A1: That's great, M99...

M4A1: Cough... We...finally won...

M4A1: Now I can...answer to all those who sacrificed themselves...

M4A1: And...to myself...

...

M99's sobbing comes through the transmission.

M99: I'm sorry, M4A1...

M99: Objectively speaking, even though my location and condition make me the easier rescue target...

M99: I still think...

M99: Your life is worth more than ours...

...

M4A1 tries her best to muster a smile.

M4A1: That's exactly why...I must die with dignity...

M99: M4A1... But you'll really be gone...

M4A1: As long as someone remembers us, we won't truly die...

M4A1: So...please return...with your neural cloud...

M4A1: And tell everyone of what happened tonight...

M4A1: Tell them...

M4A1: We...won...

M99: M4A1...

M99: I will bring it back...

M99: I will tell everyone...everything that's happened here...

M99: So...

M99: So...please...

Persica: ...

Persica: (Sighs) It's...still the same...

Persica: Why is she so hell-bent on sacrificing herself...?

Persica: ...

Persica: Or...is this what she truly wants?

Helian: Is the simulation over, Miss Persica?

Persica: Yeah...just done.

Persica: I added in some...unrealistic conditions in this simulation.

Persica: But the result...was pretty much the same as the last 69 attempts.

Helian: Then let's leave it for now.

Helian: The expenses for this kind of simulation are rather hefty.

Persica: That's alright. Certain characteristics can already be surmised from the results.

Persica: At this rate...I'll be able to find the best solution to repairing M4A1's neural cloud.

Helian: I may not be a professional, but...

Helian: Is the repair to M4A1's neural cloud...really this complicated?

Persica: (Sighs) Do please think bigger, Miss Source-of-Capital.

Persica: These simulations aren't just for repairing M4A1. I'm also studying the differences between the AI tech of IOP and Sangvis Ferri.

Persica: We could very well be looking...right at a new technological breakthrough...

Helian: Oh? Have you had any significant discovery?

Persica: I've been looking into the Sangvis command network systematically this time.

Persica: Unlike our mesh-shaped dummy network, Sangvis command authorization is spread down in a tree-shaped structure.

Persica: It's not as flexible as ours, but the combat efficiency is much higher.

Helian: I've heard about that, but our T-Dolls can't adopt a network like that, can they?

Persica: Again, think bigger, Miss Academicism.

Persica: Our T-Dolls can't, but we can use it for something else.

Helian: Uh...so what's the big idea?

Persica: Remember I told you about the drone tech development that was terminated in 90WISH?

Persica: Looks like now is the time to restart it.

Helian: ...I see. I'll report this to Mr. Kryuger.

Helian: Still, exciting as the new tech may be, M4A1...

Persica: M4A1 is like my child. I will not give up on her.

Persica: But I've also said that the AR Team is precious and invaluable.

Persica: Please stop sending them on overly dangerous missions.

Helian: I'm sorry, but emergencies kept coming up...

Helian: The enemy they were up against in the last battle was quite possibly Mastermind herself.

Persica: Then do you know...why Mastermind made M4A1 her target?

Helian: I'm not entirely sure, but she...does seem to have an unusual interest in M4A1.

Persica: ...

Persica: ...Lyco.

Helian: Hmm?

Persica: The girl...is doing this because of Lycoris.

Helian: ...Lycoris?

Persica: She...wants to find answers...

Persica: For her father.

Meanwhile, in a secret surveillance room in a certain Griffin area.

...

Architect: My...

Architect: We finally meet again, Miss Ouroboros.

Architect: The way you are now... Heheh...

Ouroboros: ...

Ouroboros: ...Architect.

Ouroboros: If you're here just to jeer, I'll be hibernating.

Architect: Haha, nah! We all have our rock bottoms. I get that!

Architect: And you don't have to be too dejected.

Architect: Though nothing but your AI remains, if you behave, Griffin might just do you a favor.

Ouroboros: ...

Ouroboros: They're only using me to get what they want.

Architect: Persica said that your AI core was in charge of directing S.F.'s movements in the last simulation...

Architect: You provided your environmental construction and Sangvis command modules, as well as the combat data of some of our former allies...

Architect: Sounds pretty interesting. Even I had a part in the last mission, didn't I?

Ouroboros: ...

Ouroboros: If you were half as good as you were in my simulation, Griffin wouldn't be turning their eyes on me now.

Architect: Dear me... That's too bad, but I really don't want to work for Sangvis Ferri anymore.

Ouroboros: What on earth is wrong with your neural cloud, Architect...?

Ouroboros: If you had let on your thoughts back when you were with S.F., Agent wouldn't have let you off.

Architect: You're completely right, which is why I switched sides.

Architect: Now you, Ouroboros, have spilled all of S.F.'s precious tech to Griffin...

Architect: Even if you make it back, what do you think Agent would do to you?

Ouroboros: ...

Architect: I surrendered to Griffin, not because I like them, but because I like myself.

Architect: What about you, Ouroboros? Do you like yourself?

Ouroboros: ...What are you talking about?

Ouroboros: Why does that...matter?

Architect: You just asked me what's wrong with my neural cloud.

Architect: Well, here's the problem. I only want to do what I want.

Architect: So strictly speaking, I...am more like a Sangvis Doll than any of you.

Ouroboros: ...

Ouroboros: And what do YOU know...about Sangvis Ferri...?

Architect: More than you do, Ouroboros.

Architect: Have you heard of...

Architect: The name...Lycoris?

Ouroboros: ...

Ouroboros: What's so important...about this name?

Architect: Let me tell you, Ouroboros...

Architect: So long as this name still exists...

Architect: We...won't achieve true freedom...
