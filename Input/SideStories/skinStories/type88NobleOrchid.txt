...

Oh...!

C-crap!

...

M99: QJY-88?

...

M99: QJY-88, are you in there?

M99: I'm coming in, okay?

...

...Clatter.

...

M99: Found you!

QJY-88: Ugh...

QJY-88: How did you find me so quickly...? I hid all the way inside...

M99: Well...I didn't know you were in there, but the guardian lion is sitting right in front of the closet.

M99: Then again, why are you in the closet...?

QJY-88: ...

QJY-88: ...I just remembered that there was something I forgot to get inside.

M99: But you still didn't have to climb into it...

QJY-88: I really left something in the closet!

QJY-88: ...Though why have you come looking for me here at the workshop, Captain? Do you need me to repair some damaged equipments...?

M99: Repair?

M99: Huh? Didn't we all agree to get together properly for Spring Festival?

M99: You didn't show up on time so I came looking for you.

QJY-88: ...

QJY-88: No...

M99: Huh?

QJY-88: I don't...

QJY-88: Captain...I don't want to go...

M99: What? Why would you say that...

M99: The team hasn't been able to get to know you properly because of how busy things have been...

M99: Besides, as a new recruit, it is also your duty to get to know your companions!

QJY-88: But it's so scary out there!

QJY-88: Everyone's changed all of a sudden... They're all holding things I've never seen before... And the new clothes...

QJY-88: If they see me right now, they'll all laugh at me...

M99: Nobody will laugh at you! You've changed into your new clothes too, haven't you?

M99: Seeing each other getting dressed up and looking pretty is what's fun about having a festival. You don't have to be so stressed about it.

...

QJY-88 recoils further back into the closet.

QJY-88: How could I do that...in front of others...?

QJY-88: If I'd known better, I would've just ordered my outfit online... The style would be more popular...

QJY-88: Argh, why did I not think it through...?

M99: Not think it through...?

M99: So the outfit you're wearing right now...is your own design?

QJY-88: Uh...

QJY-88: Yeah...I just wanted to test out some new plug-in accessories and hidden mechanisms...

M99: But isn't that great?!

M99: Your outfit is completely one-of-a-kind! That's so much more precious than merchandise ordered from some website!

QJY-88: That's not true!

QJY-88: This style...is something only I enjoy personally...

M99: And? What's wrong with that?

QJY-88: Everything!

QJY-88: ...

M99: Do you...not like it, QJY-88?

QJY-88: No, I don't dislike it...

QJY-88: It's just...I never thought I'd design something like this...

QJY-88: Everyone thinks...I'd prefer something more...

M99: But nonetheless, you finished it, didn't you?

M99: You must've been really happy when it was completed, right?

QJY-88: I didn't really give it much thought when making it...

QJY-88: Before I knew it, it was done...

QJY-88: I could've left out more traditional elements...

M99: That's not really necessary though?

M99: I mean, it just wouldn't be the same if you'd done away with them. I think you made the right call keeping them.

QJY-88: But these dated elements...are widely considered to be old-fashioned. It says so in the books.

QJY-88: We should let go of tacky and outdated things and focus on creating new trends...

QJY-88: If I think it looks great, doesn't that prove the books are right?!

M99: Wait, what books...are you talking about?

...M99 notices the fashion magazines scattered about the worktop.

M99: ...

M99: (Mutters) Oh...I see...

QJY-88: Just leave me alone in here for a while, Captain...

QJY-88: It's not like anyone would notice I'm not there...

M99: Hmm.

M99: Miss QJY-88, I'm going to drag you out.

QJY-88: Huh?

QJY-88: Captain, what are you trying to—

M99: Hah!

QJY-88: Whoaaaaaa!

Guardian Lion: Roar...

...M99 drags QJY-88 out of the closet with one hand.

M99: Right!

M99: Stand up straight and let me take a look!

QJY-88: Ugh...

QJY-88: Ughhhhh...

M99: It's an excellent design. The dark green is beautiful!

M99: Hey...is that...a pocket?

QJY-88: You noticed?!

QJY-88: This hidden pocket can take a lot of weight! And the dress retains its shape even if I sling my gun over it!

QJY-88: And look, there's a space down here for an external module to adjust the body temperature!

QJY-88: It took me a lot of research to fit these small parts into the layers of fabric!

M99: Aah... So it's like that, huh. I understand everything now...

QJY-88: But...

QJY-88: If nobody likes it...what's the point in making all these...?

M99: If you ask me, a design created with passion and enthusiasm is the most beautiful in and of itself.

M99: The only reason why you don't think it looks good is because you never find such clothes in fashion magazines, right?

QJY-88: But fashion exists as a standard trend of what is universally accepted...

QJY-88: To deviate from this standard...is to be unstylish...

M99: The word "trend" itself denotes how transient it is.

M99: What truly matters is how we find something that resonates with ourselves in the ever-shifting conventions.

QJY-88: But if I only rely on my own standards, how can I be sure...

M99: Although everyone has their own predilection, what you consider beautiful isn't always ugly to others.

M99: Quite the contrary! The fact that you like this design means there's something in there that resonates with you.

M99: And if it resonates with you, surely it'll resonate with someone else!

QJY-88: But what if...

QJY-88: ...only very, very few people share my taste...?

M99: Don't be so sure.

M99: This is the first time you're spending the Spring Festival with us. You're in for a shock.

QJY-88: Huh?

QJY-88: W-what do you mean? Please don't scare me, Captain...

M99: Not a literal shock!

M99: As for what exactly I mean...you'll understand when you see 95, 97, and even Gd DSR-50.

M99: There's nothing bad about learning from magazines, but you should be more confident in what you like!

QJY-88: But what if I stand by what I like...only to realize I've been wrong all along?

M99: There's no right or wrong when it comes to aesthetics. All that matters is that you truly understand what you stand by!

M99: Even if you don't fit in with the people around you, the world is a big place; you WILL find someone who shares your interests one day!

QJY-88: Ugh...

QJY-88: Alright... Thank you, Captain...

M99: That said... I'm more concerned about you getting mobbed. Once they see your outfit, they'll probably all beg you to make modifications to their clothing or something...

M99: Getting out of that situation won't be easy, so if you want to avoid such complications...

QJY-88: ...I'm happy to make simple modifications. They just have to tell me what they want...

QJY-88: That may actually be a good idea!

QJY-88: If I can find out what everyone likes, I may be able to understand the latest fashion trends around me.

QJY-88: It's a great way to start the new year...to verify what I've learned from my magazines!

M99: Yep!

M99: If you're ready, we should set off.

QJY-88: Okay, I—

...Bang bang bang bang.

...A loud and continuous noise of exploding firecrackers suddenly comes from outside.

QJY88 & M99: WHOAAAAAA!

M99: Freaking ART556. There she goes again...

M99: Nevermind. I'll let her have some fun this time, seeing as it's New Year...

M99: ...

M99: Hmm? QJY-88, where have you gone?

QJY-88: I-it's too scary out there...

QJY-88: Captain, p-p-please...just let me stay inside the closet...
