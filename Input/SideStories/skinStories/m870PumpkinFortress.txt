...

Early in the morning, at the Griffin dorm.

After being awoken by the knocking on her door, M870 furiously bellows -

M870: Who the hell is that? What the hell is all this racket early in the morning?!

M870: Do you have so much money that you need me to fine it all away?!

M870 savagely kicks aside the blanket and opens the door—

And finds KSVK practically sparkling as she stands in front of her.

KSVK: Good morning, O Chosen One.

M870: KSVK, you'd better have a damn good explanation for this buffoonery.

M870: Or else I'll stuff the biggest fine I can write into your hat!

KSVK: Do not be angry, M870. We shall soon usher in a storm the likes of which have never been seen before.

KSVK: And before the storm comes, nobody can know what they will gain or lose to it.

M870: Explain yourself quickly while you can still speak.

M870: If it's not funny enough, I'm gonna shoot a hole right through you and turn you into a donut.

KSVK: Today, all the T-Dolls in Griffin will be gathered together, to celebrate a carnival of spirits!

M870: Getting real tired of your crap here.

KSVK: During the test of courage, terror will stalk every Doll, and the only way to shake it off is to scare others.

KSVK: Or perhaps, no souls will find the way back before daylight...

M870: So after filtering out all the bullcrap, what you're saying is that there's going to be a test of courage tonight?

M870: Finally, something interesting. ♪

KSVK: They say the victor will win a year's supply of soda water.

KSVK: Come, accept the guidance of fate and join us!

...After the test of courage officially begins.

M870 pats her newly-acquired sensor as she walks along.

M870: Man, they spouted as much crap as KSVK did. In any case, there's the monster team and the victim team, and the more victims that the monsters scare, the more points they get.

M870: Still, are they really going to use the volume of the screams picked up by this detector to tell if someone is scared?

M870: It just seems dumb...but eh, isn't that Griffin's way of doing things?

M870 locks onto a trembling Doll nearby.

M870: Hehe, run while you can, dorks!

M870: I'll catch up to you soon enough and take a picture of your stupid-looking faces once you crap your pants!

...30 minutes later.

M870 gnaws on a stalk of grass as she lies on a tree branch in utter boredom.

M870: Hmph. This is lame.

M870: You just scare them and these Dolls cough up their soda water right away.

M870: (Burps)

M870 glances around. There is nobody in the vicinity.

M870: The only thing those dorks are good at is running away.

M870: The moment they hear a scream, they vanish like they spotted my chopper on Highway 666.

Just then, WA2000 sneakily crawls out of the vegetation and passes under the tree.

WA2000: Where did they go? I've been hiding there for so long but I didn't manage to scare anyone...

Still standing under the tree, WA2000 plants her hands on her hips and sighs.

WA2000: During the last haunted house event, the Commander heard my embarrassing screams...

WA2000: This time, I'm going to use my flawless performance to make the Commander forget all about it...

WA2000: It's just dressing up as monsters and scaring people, right? That ought to be easy.

M870 spits the blade of grass from her mouth and her smile becomes more and more wicked.

M870: Oh yes, pretending to be a monster is the easiest thing today.

M870: That's because everyone else is dressed up like one, so I don't need to disguise myself any more...

WA2000: What? What was that? Who said that just now...

As she watches WA2000 look around anxiously, M870 fights to keep herself from laughing.

M870: Huh, you can't see me? I've been behind you all this time...

WA2000: Don't talk nonsense...

WA2000 stiffly turns around...

M870 takes the opportunity to leap down...

M870: Here I am—!

WA2000: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

Announcement: Monster WA2000 is out! Score - 0!

M870 smiles in satisfaction as she watches WA2000 flee into the distance, trailing dust clouds in her wake.

M870: Pffft, what a shame I didn't get to see the look on WA2000's face.

As M870 basks in her smugness, she is pulled back to reality by another pitiful shriek.

M870: It seems the mice have grown bold while the master's away and they're seeking to steal my spot.

Gr G36c: WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! SAVE ME BIG SIS!

After Gr G36c dumps her gigantic Jack o' Lantern on the ground and runs away, Gr PSG-1 wipes away the fake blood on herself and her Dummy and gets up off the ground.

Gr PSG-1: Another one bites the dust. Looks like victory is assured!

M870: Using fake blood to go with her act? Hehe...

M870: Idiots will be idiots, after all. Looks like such childish pranks are all they can come up with even if they overload their neural clouds.

M870 looks at the cross in the distance and an idea suddenly comes to mind.

She hides in a corner where Gr PSG-1 can't see her, then grabs her throat to produce an eerie voice.

M870: You...

M870: Are you...one of us?

Gr PSG-1: Who's that? Come out!

M870: I would like to, but I am badly wounded...

M870: But sniffing the blood on you has lit the fire of madness within me, and I fear to startle you.

M870 deliberately inhales.

M870: Mmm... The remnants of your last meal smells...delicious.

Gr PSG-1: ...

M870: Why do you not speak, my kin?

Gr PSG-1: I suddenly remembered that I had something to do...

M870: What could possibly cause you such anxiety on a leisurely night like this?

M870: It is Halloween tonight, and the prey have all let down their guard; it is the perfect time for us to feast...

Gr PSG-1 shivers.

Gr PSG-1: Y-yeah, I suddenly remembered that I forgot to put my prey back in the warehouse...

M870: Oh, do not leave! My kin, I pray that you will do a small favor for me before you depart, at the very least.

Gr PSG-1: ...What kind of small favor is it?

M870: Do you see the cross over there? It vexes me to lay eyes upon it, but I cannot remove it myself.

M870: If you can help me tear it down, I will bestow my most exquisite chalice of blood upon you.

Gr PSG-1: ...

Gr PSG-1: I'll help you, but you can keep the wine glass.

Gr PSG-1 nervously approaches the cross, which has a handcuff covered in bloodstains attached to it.

Gr PSG-1: Is that vampire blood...the blood of our kind?

M870: Oh yes, these shackles are used to punish the traitors of our bloodline.

M870: Said traitors are those who cannot hunt properly, who only know how to fish in troubled waters; vampires who bring disgrace to their very names.

M870: And of course —

M870: That also includes those villains who pretend to be vampires.

Gr PSG-1: So...what happened to the traitor who was supposed to be handcuffed here?

Gr PSG-1 is scared stiff. M870 takes advantage of this to quietly exit the shadows and approach Gr PSG-1.

M870: Why, the first rays of dawn shone upon her and vaporized her into ash. ♪

M870: Come to think of it, you smell lovely. I can't detect the slightest trace of my kindred's blood from you...

Gr PSG-1 trembles and subconsciously grips the cross more tightly.

M870: Oh my, you wouldn't happen to be a traitoras well, would you?

Gr PSG-1: AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!

Gr PSG-1 is about to pull out the cross to protect herself, but M870 is one step ahead and has pinned her in place.

By the time Gr PSG-1 comes to her senses, she finds herself already handcuffed to the cross.

Announcement: Monster Gr PSG-1 is out! Score - 8.

M870: Ahahahaha, not bad, but you're a far cry from me.

Gr PSG-1: You, you... Why is it you?!

M870: Were you seriously expecting to meet a vampire, you moron?

M870: Oh man, you looked so damn stupid, ahahahaha...

PSG1: ...

PSG1: I can't believe I actually believed MDR's intel about vampires...

PSG1: Fine, you win. Can you let me go now?

M870: And why would I do that? I went to so much trouble to capture my prey, so obviously I'm going to show it off to everyone!

M870: Just be a good girl and stay here as my trophy. ♪

M870 leaves in a good mood and begins searching for her next target.

Nobody notices the Jack o' Lantern that G36C left behind has vanished...

After some searching, she spots Gr Mk23, who is looking all over for the Commander.

M870: While this target is easy and boring, I should just make do since I can't find anything more challenging.

M870 hides inside a bush, but a hand grabs her just as she's about to approach Gr Mk23.

KSVK: O child of destiny, it seems your hunt tonight has been most bountiful.

M870: Oi, what the hell are you doing, trying to assault an officer?

KSVK: I simply saw that you have slowed your pace. You looked like you would be overcome with terror at any moment...

M870: You thought I was going to get overtaken? That's the funniest thing I've heard all year.

KSVK: Therefore I wish to bestow a gift upon you; it's both a keep and a cage.

KSVK: It is up to you whether or not it will be a fortress that defends you from terror or a prison that traps you inside with fear.

M870: Are you high on petrol fumes of something? The hell are you running your mouth about?

M870: Stop interfering with my enforcement or I'll scare you along with her.

KSVK suddenly pulls out a huge Jack o' Lantern from a nearby grass patch and slams it down around M870's body.

KSVK: In that case, I wish you all the best in escaping this storm of terror.

M870: Ah—! What the hell is this?!

M870: Hey, get back here!

As she watches KSVK run off, all M870 can do is try to free herself.

However, the Jack o' Lantern fits snugly around M870's neck, leaving her trapped and immobile inside it.

A night breeze happens to blow, and it stirs up the strands of M870's hair.

M870: Who's that?! Who's behind me?!

With great effort, M870 manages to turn around, but there's nobody behind her.

M870: (Groans) Are you trying to assault an officer?!

M870: I'm warning you, assaulting an officer of the law is a ticketable offense!

The only answer to her empty threats is the moaning of the wind.

M870: A-and who's that howling over there?!

The bright moonlight casts distinct shadows of the tree branches on the ground, making them look like claws and fangs reaching out for her.

M870 gulps, then she suddenly hears a rustling noise from behind her, while the shadows on the ground begin swaying violently—

Almost as if some vengeful fiend was ripping its way through space and time in order to get at her—

M870: Waaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh—!

M870: Help meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

M870 wails as she runs in a blind panic.

The massive Jack o' Lantern prevents her from seeing her feet, and soon M870 trips and falls.

Unable to stand up, all M870 can do is wildly roll back and forth as she screams.

M870: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh—!

M870: Someone help meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

After what seems like several centuries, several pairs of feet finally enter M870's field of vision.

MG3: Huh, your Halloween outfit is pretty special, M870.

Type 97S: So you were screaming because it was so round that you couldn't stand up?

QBU-88: Was that you crying for help just now?

M870: Quit chatting over there! Hurry up and get me out of this!

Type 97S: Easier said than done. Now that you're stuck so tightly in there, how are we going to free you?

M870: I don't care how you do it! Just get me out of here!

QBU-88: Don't worry. Let me see how we can get you loose.

QBU-88 opens up her toolkit on the ground and begins trying the contents on the Jack o' Lantern.

...20 minutes later.

QBU-88: Nothing's working...and I don't have any bigger tools with me...

M870: Oi! Hurry up already!

M870: More Dolls are gathering to watch! If you're going to embarrass me like this, then you might as well shoot me!

Type 97S: No problem, I'll do it—

MG3: You're going too far, Hawk.

MG3: How can you point a gun at other people?

Type 97S: Then what should I do? I still need to go get the Commander.

MG3: There has to be another way!

QBU-88: Be quiet, both of you...

M870 looks at the arguing trio as she lies on the ground. After much effort and frustration, she manages to sit up, intent on putting an end to this.

MG3: Just be patient and wait—

M870: Wait for what?! Don't you dorks understand what's going on?

M870: I'm still stuck in here!

Type 97S: Honestly...

MG3: Give me 5 minutes, I'll be back right away!

MG3 speeds off as she tries to contact the Commander.

M870: Heeeeeeey, hold it right there! You're speeding!

M870: Also, you haven't solved my problem yet! HEY!!!

Type 97S: Ahhhhh, what a pain in the ass!

Type 97S shoves QBU-88 aside and takes aim at M870—

Blam!

M870: WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

30 minutes later, M870 — who has given up on participating in the game — stands listlessly among the Commander's escort squad.

Commander: I'm really not used to how abnormally quiet you are today, M870...

M870: ...

Commander: Looks like the Jack o' Lantern has traumatized you.

Commander: Here, close your eyes, I'll give you a present.

In a rare moment of obedience, M870 closes her eyes.

Surrounded by darkness, M870 feels herself sink into a soft, warm embrace...

Commander: How about opening your eyes now, M870?

M870: Holy-! Not this damn Jack o' Lantern again!

Commander: Relax, come now, do you feel the button here?

M870 nervously presses the button.

M870: Eh? The Jack o' Lantern opened up?

Commander: I asked the workshop Dolls to help me make a simple improvement to the Jack o' Lantern.

Commander: Feel better now?

M870: This is assault of a police officer! I'm going to—

M870: Eh, forget it. I'll let you off with a warning this time, on account of how thoughtful you were.

Announcement: The Griffin Test of Courage has ended. Please step forward to claim your prizes!

Commander: Go on. M870. Go get your prize.

...At the test of courage prize presentation.

Kalina: ...Now then, that was the list of the Dolls who won a prize.

Kalina: Please come up and collect your prizes from me!

Kalina: Thank you all for participating. See you next year!

QBU-88: Kalina, I'm here for the 20%-off supermarket discount coupon.

Kalina: Eh? But we don't have a prize like that...

M870: Kalina, give me my soda water first!

Kalina: We don't have a prize like that either...

M870: ...

QBU-88: ...

M870: Where the hell is KSVK?! I'm going to stuff her into a pair of speakers and blast her with death metal all night long!

QBU-88: I can't believe KSVK tricked me...and I worked so hard to scare everyone too...

Kalina: KSVK? What are you talking about?

Kalina: Someone knocked KSVK out and she's still unconscious.

M870: Say what?!

QBU-88: Ahhhhhhhh!

...Meanwhile, in the Griffin dorms.

As "KSVK" takes off her makeup in front of the mirror, she suddenly smirks at the KSVK who is sound asleep on the bed.

KSVK?: Happy Halloween, you little piece of trash. I had a lot of fun today. ♪

KSVK: Mmmzzzz...
