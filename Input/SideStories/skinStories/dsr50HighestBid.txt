Before the start of the mission.

I glance around and spot Gd DSR-50 right away in the midst of the cocktail party.

She is surrounded by a large group of guests, and it seems like she is happily chatting away.

Commander: Looks like she's quite enjoying this occasion.

Commander: This isn't an easy mission, so I hope nothing goes wrong...

DSR walks up to me while I'm lost in thought.

Gd DSR-50: Whatcha thinking about~?

Commander: ...Ah!

Gd DSR-50: You're too focused, Commander. Did you not hear my footsteps?

Gd DSR-50: It's very easy for bad people to ambush you like this, you know~

Commander: Ahem, I was just a little worried.

Gd DSR-50: Worried?

Gd DSR-50: Then let me guess what's worrying you...

Gd DSR-50: Is it because you're jealous of me getting so close to those people?

Commander: Haah!? O-Of course not!

Gd DSR-50: My, but that was a hasty response, Commander... Could it be that I hit the nail on the head?

Commander: ...That's enough playing around, DSR.

Commander: I want you to proceed carefully with this mission. Don't forget about our objective.

Gd DSR-50: Understood, Commander.

Gd DSR-50: It's just that your expression didn't seem quite suited to the festive atmosphere, so I wanted to help you loosen up.

Commander: ...I appreciate your goodwill, DSR.

Commander: Just that if we run into this sort of thing again, try not to pick such an...intense topic.

Gd DSR-50: Order received. I'll do my best to carry it out.

Gd DSR-50: Although, I still want to say that you're the only one I'm concerned about, Commander...

Commander: ...

I don't know how to respond, so I remain silent. She pauses and gently laughs.

Gd DSR-50: â€”Your order, that is.

Gd DSR-50: Our conversation is simply a cover to blend in better with the crowd. That would improve the odds of achieving our aim, am I right?

Commander: Yes, just be careful.

Commander: I'll be heading off now to check on the others...

I quickly leave before DSR could respond.

During the mission.

Gd DSR-50 blocks Grizzly and Zas while EVO 3 draws off Welrod.

Zas M21: This way... Oh no.

Gd DSR-50: What a keen child you are. However...

Gd DSR-50 raises her gun and shoots the chandelier on the ceiling. The falling fixture crashes behind Zas, who was running ahead of Grizzly.

Gd DSR-50: ...What you're trying to do is useless.

Zas M21: Grizzly, get out of here!

Grizzly: Are you crazy!?

Gd DSR-50: ...My, do you have so much free time to be exchanging sweet nothings?

Zas gets in front of Grizzly and exchanges fire with DSR.

...

After a brief word with Zas, Grizzly turns to run into the cloud of smoke and dust, vanishing without a trace in the blink of an eye.

Zas M21: What, not going to chase her?

Gd DSR-50: You won't let me, will you?

Gd DSR-50: And besides...having you here to play with me is enough.

...

After the battle between Gd DSR-50 and Zas M21...

Gd DSR-50: I didn't think I'd run into the grand prize after changing my route for safety's sake.

UMP9: Uh oh.

UMP9: I'm sorry, but would you mind pretending you never saw me?

Gd DSR-50: I'm afraid I can't do that.

Gd DSR-50: Now then, hand over the jewel or become a pile of scrap...

Gd DSR-50: Which of these two futures would you prefer?

UMP9: I can't accept either option.

UMP9: But given the circumstances...

UMP9 looks around, but there is nothing in the corridor that could be used as cover.

UMP9: Fine fine, I surrender, come take the jewel.

Gd DSR-50: Put the jewel on the ground and leave with your gun.

Gd DSR-50: Then I'll do as you wish and pretend that I never saw you.

UMP9: Hm? You're not coming over to get it?

Gd DSR-50: Thinking too much about those little tricks is bad for your health, you know~

DSR fires a shot at the ground near UMP9's feet.

UMP9: ...Uwah!

Gd DSR-50: I trust that you'll be obedient now...little miss who does not exist.

Twenty-odd minutes later.

Gd DSR-50: I see...so EVO 3 fell for your tricks.

Gd DSR-50: The jewel taken from the younger sister got taken back by the elder sister.

UMP45: Yes, that's more or less what happened.

UMP45: If I surrender now, will you pretend you never saw me?

Gd DSR-50: You sisters really are alike...

Gd DSR-50: I've gotten my fill of fun today.

Gd DSR-50: As a reward, I'll pretend I never met you.

UMP45: ...Oh?

Gd DSR-50: Are you not happy with that?

Gd DSR-50: If you think it's not enough, we can enjoy a long night tonight together if you wish.

UMP45: No thanks.

UMP45: Save that goodwill for the Commander.

Gd DSR-50: What a shame. You're always so stuffy.

Gd DSR-50: Hurry up and leave. I won't be responsible for what happens if I change my mind.

...

After the battle, I find Gd DSR-50 in a nearby bar.

Sitting in a corner drinking by herself, she seems to be in quite a good mood.

Gd DSR-50: The whereabouts of the jewel, huh... I'm not too sure myself.

Gd DSR-50: It was probably taken by the true phantom thieves.

Commander: The true phantom thieves?

Gd DSR-50: That's my guess.

Gd DSR-50: Hmmm... I wonder if I could've gotten a better reward out of you if I caught them.

Commander: I see...

Commander: In any case, the mission is over now, so let me handle everything else.

Gd DSR-50: Mhm, understood.

Gd DSR-50: Now then, Commander...

Gd DSR-50: Since the mission is over, why don't we do something more interesting together? For instance...

Commander: ...F-For instance?

Gd DSR-50: ...For instance, having a drink together to make up for the anniversary.

Gd DSR-50: Now why's your face red? Hehe...were you thinking of something?

Commander: Ahem...a drink's not out of the question, but I've got other things I need to do.

Commander: I'll drink with you once my work is over.

Gd DSR-50: It's a date, then.

Gd DSR-50: Whether it's for tonight...or for another year of working for Griffin...

Gd DSR-50: I'll be waiting for you, Commander.
