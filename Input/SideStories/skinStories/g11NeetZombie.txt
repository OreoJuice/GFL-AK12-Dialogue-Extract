In a dormitory at the Griffin base.

416: Wake up, you sleepyhead! We have a mission!

Gr G11: Hmm...

Gr G11: Let me...sleep a bit longer...

UMP45: We don't have to force her if she doesn't want to go.

UMP9: See? I told you she has no intention of getting up today.

416: Seriously, when DOES she want to get up on her own?

UMP9: Whatever. 45 did say she can sit out on this mission.

416: Each of us gets a bigger share then, right?

UMP9: Makes sense.

416: I don't mind.

416: Or should I say, this will actually make the mission easier.

UMP9: Oh? You think so?

UMP9: I'll give you a minute to change your mind. Good luck.

With that, UMP9 slips out of the dorm.

416: You...

416 turns and looks at Gr G11, still dozing in bed. She gives her a kick.

Gr G11: OW! That hurt! I said I'm not coming...

416: Slacking again today, are we?

Gr G11: I asked for a leave of absence. I need to get used to this place...

416: You know where you are?

Gr G11: In the Griffin dorm.

416: You think you belong here? Think you can stay here forever?

416: We're renegade T-Dolls.

416: Besides, Griffin has no use for lazy bums like you.

Gr G11: I know...

Gr G11: But even for just a while, I wanna enjoy it...

416: ...

416: You're just hanging around, aren't you? Or should I say, dawdling?

Gr G11: I...know where I belong...

Gr G11: ...probably.

416: That's your choice.

416: But I won't wait forever.

Gr G11: I can't be like you, 416.

416: You're not being yourself either.

Gr G11 buries her head under her pillow.

Gr G11: I don't know what you mean!

416: Fine. I'll let you off this time.

Gr G11 hears 416 sighing faintly.

416: But Gr G11...

416: There won't always be a next time.

Gr G11 listens as 416 leaves the room and shuts the door behind her.

Gr G11: I didn't...do anything wrong...right?

Gr G11: Yeah...I didn't do anything wrong.

Gr G11: All I need is some good sleep...

Gr G11: It's my holiday today... Forget about them...

Knock, knock, knock!

Gr G11: Hmm? Is 416 back?!

Knock, knock, knock!

Gr G11: Is she in a rush? Maybe she forgot her keys...?

Gr G11 shambles sleepily from the bed to the door. She opens the door...then regrets it immediately.

Springfield: Good morning, you're...

Springfield: Going by the name registered on the list of residents…Gr G11, is that correct?

Gr G11: Uh... Um...

Gr G11: You're have the wrong T-Doll!

Before Gr G11 can slam the door, Springfield jams a foot in through the gap.

Springfield: My, may I have a minute?

Gr G11: Uh...

Springfield: Ah, did I frighten you? I'm really sorry. My mistake.

Springfield: I thought I knew every single person and T-Doll at the base. It's so unusual to meet someone new I forgot my manners.

Springfield: Let me introduce myself. Springfield M1903. Nice to meet you.

Gr G11: Um, I'm Gr G11. Nice to meet you...

Gr G11: (Wait... Did I just give myself away...)

Springfield: Hello, Gr G11. I'm here because we're doing an event for Halloween this year...

Springfield: If it's possible, the Commander wishes all members at the base to more or less take part in the activities.

Springfield: I saw a name on the list that's not out on duty nor given work for Halloween, so that's why I'm here.

Gr G11: Halloween, huh...

Gr G11: I'm not particularly interested. It's my hard-earned vacation today...

Springfield: Naturally, you won't be working for nothing. Like all battle missions, all T-Dolls who contribute will be rewarded accordingly.

Springfield: Let me see... Do you like candies and snacks, Gr G11?

Gr G11: Candies...!

Gr G11: (Hmm... I haven't had any for days...)

Gr G11: (I'm running low on money and I'm not getting paid any time soon...)

Springfield: Miss Gr G11?

Gr G11: Hmm...

Gr G11: If you have candies, I guess I could help out a little...

Springfield: (Smiles) Then we have a deal.

Gr G11: Uh... I don't wanna do really tiring and troublesome stuff just for candies...

Springfield: In any case, you've agreed to help, right?

Gr G11: Huh?

Before Gr G11 can figure out what's happening, she's already being dragged along by Springfield toward the preparation site for the event.

In a certain warehouse at the Griffin base.

Gr G11: Maybe I should've refused after all...

M1919A4: Huh? But why? It's a rare occasion that only comes around once a year!

Makarov: You have come this far. This event is like any other mission. Deserters will not be forgiven.

After Springfield brought her here, Gr G11 is caught firmly in the hands of two Griffin T-Dolls with no way to escape.

One is dressed like a vampire...

And the other has a large pumpkin on her head.

Gr G11: But I'm just here to get candies! I can go once I have them, right?

Makarov: Looks like we have an open book of a T-Doll.

Makarov: Why would there be any free candies in the world? They come at the cost of endless toil and labor.

Gr G11: (Whimpers)

M1919A4: It's hardly that scary!

M1919A4: In fact, even though the preparation work is a bit of a drag, we're now having lots of fun playing let's pretend!

Gr G11: Fun...? What do you mean?

Gr G11: How could any work be fun?

M1919A4: Of course it can be! We're gonna scare people in the haunted house on Halloween!

M1919A4: Just imagine their reactions! Doesn't that alone make you excited?

Gr G11: Excited...about what...?

M1919A4: Heheh...

Makarov: Raise your arms.

Gr G11: Huh?

Makarov: M1919, hand me another roll of bandage...

Makarov: Hmm, something is still missing.

M1919A4: I know! Don't we still have that joke retractable knife that we couldn't think of a use for?!

Makarov: You're right. If we fix that onto her head...

Gr G11 whimpers faintly and helplessly as she's being fiddled around by the two.

...But after a while.

When M1919 passes a mirror to Gr G11, the latter stares at her own reflection with wide eyes.

She is wrapped in white bandage from head to toe. It's a rough job, but coupled with her pale skin and dazed expression, she really gives off the vibes of a living dead.

Gr G11: Is that...me?

M1919A4: That's right! What do you think? Isn't my idea ingenious? Vampire, Frankenstein, Cat Girl...

M1919A4: I knew we were missing something during the discussion. Now that I thought about it, it's a zombie! We can't do without the living dead in good old horror movies!

Gr G11: (Nods) Indeed...! The living dead is a must in horror movies!

M1919A4: Ah, I see you're a person of culture as well! Care to join my ranks and become one of my spawns?

Makarov: Even though the first-aid bandage is only a substitute because we've run out of cosmetics and props...

Makarov: It works unexpectedly well. Probably because you have the right...air?

Makarov: But just a reminder that we don't have much time left. The event is about to begin.

M1919A4: Ack! Have we spent that much time on her? We got too carried away...

Gr G11: Um, may I ask, what...exactly do I have to do?

Makarov: Just lie in your coffin over there. When someone comes close, we'll give you a signal, and you...

M1919A4: Listen carefully. You're our ace. The cleanup hitter and powerhouse on a baseball team. The final climax!

M1919A4: The zombie pushes off the coffin lid, bursts out of the ground, gives a terrifying growl and stumbles toward the screaming patrons!

M1919A4: Those naïve and stupid college students breaking into graveyards in movies will pay for their ignorance with their lives!

M1919A4: Ahhhh, blood! Ahhhh, innards! Victory belongs to the lucky star who holds on tight to her chainsaw!!!

Makarov: Who would understand such gibberish...

Gr G11: I-I think...I get it!

Gr G11: (Balls up her fists) These scenes are literally unfolding before my eyes!

Makarov: How unusual it is to find someone who's birds of a feather with M1919...but that's nice.

M1919A4: Not bad. You have much potential, kiddo! Springfield said you're Gr G11, yeah?

Gr G11: J-Ja...

M1919A4: I'm M1919. We've only just met, but I like you very much!

Makarov: I'm Makarov.

M1919A4: Where have you been all my life?! I hope I'll get to go on missions with you in the future, or just have another chat.

M1919A4: But for now, let's take our places and prepare to welcome those brainless, unwelcomed guests!

Gr G11: R-Roger!

Gr G11 climbs into her coffin in high spirits.

Makarov: Let's get to our posts ourselves.

M1919A4: Muster all your vigor and scare our visitors out of their wits!

Once the lid is on, the narrow coffin in which G11 lies becomes pitch black.

Even so, she isn't the slightest bit uneasy.

Gr G11: Ah, someone is counting on me... And I'm a zombie... This is literally...THE BEST.

Gr G11: I can't let them down... Though how should I make my entrance?

Gr G11: Growling like "eeerrrrgghhhhh" as I stumble forward slowly the way Walkers do before Season 10 is pretty classic, but running around and screeching like the Berserkers after the Great Mutation is also very cool...

Gr G11: Sadly...I can't really do that...with this thing on my head...

Lying in wait in this small and cozy enclosed space, Gr G11's consciousness starts slipping away...

Gr G11: The gigantic Zombie King in the finale of Season 13...

Gr G11: Snore...

Gr G11: ...

When Gr G11 opens her eyes...

Gr G11: Hmm... I'm stuffed, Fraulein Zombie Maid...

Gr G11: So noisy... Let me sleep a bit more... Let go, 9... ACK!

Gr G11: D-Did I fall asleep? I'm still in the coffin?

Gr G11: Ah, I can hear footsteps...

Gr G11: Here it comes...!

Gr G11: Wait. How do I open the coffin lid again??

Gr G11: Sheisse...! I promised I'd come in as the final climax!

…Gr G11 kicks the lid clean off the coffin.

Just as G11 steps out of the coffin, a pale T-Doll dressed as a little pumpkin is passing right by, with another blurry figure pulling her along.

Gr G11: (Gut. Time to start the party...)

Gr G11: RAAAAGHHHHHHH....AARRRGGGGHHHH...

Gr MP5: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Gr G11: (It's working! Let me...step it up!)

Gr G11: HEEEERRRRGHHHHH....UUUURRRGGHHH...

???: Everybody keep calm! Stop it, all of you!

Gr MP5: WAHHHHHHHHHH!!

Gr MP5: AAAAHHHHH GO AWAY! GO AWAY!

???: Calm down, Gr MP5!

Gr G11: ...Huh?

The T-Doll screams as she dashes unexpectedly towards Gr G11.

Gr MP5: GO AWAY! GET AWAY FROM ME!!

Gr G11: Whoa! Aw! Ouch! S-Stop it... I don't like pain... Ack! Aw!

Gr MP5: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!

Gr G11: S-Stop hitting me! I'm sorry! I-I was wrong... Ahhhhhh...

???: Stop fighting, both of you!

???: H-How on earth has it come to this...

The two T-Dolls wail dismally in harmony, until one of them gradually falls silent.

Griffin Control.

Springfield: I'm so sorry about this. I never thought this would happen. You must be feeling terrible...

Springfield: Gr MP5 didn't mean it though. Can you forgive her for the sake of this bucket of sweets?

Gr G11: (Sobs)

Holding onto the candy bucket, Gr G11 nods as she sobs.

Springfield: That's a good girl. Then I'll be dealing with the aftermath. Just sit here and wait for a minute.

Springfield: If you feel off anywhere, go straight to the Maintenance Room for an inspection just to be safe.

Gr G11: (Sniffles) Okay...

Gr G11: (Got thoroughly beaten up for no reason, but at least I got something out of it...)

???: Are you alright? Does your head still hurt?

Gr G11: You're...

Gr G11: ...Commander?

Commander: You still remember me?

Commander: Hmm... I guess we did meet each other face-to-face.

Gr G11: You know who I am?

Commander: Of course. Gr G11 of "The Squad That Doesn't Exist".

Commander: That said, with your squad temporarily staying at our base and using it as a provisional stronghold, I can't pretend that you don't exist even though that's what it says on the tin.

Commander: I noticed that your friends have all set off on a mission, leaving you behind. I was a bit worried, so I asked Springfield to check up on you.

Gr G11: Huh...

Gr G11: All I want...is a bit of "me time"...every now and then.

Commander: If so, how about joining us over here?

Gr G11: ...What?

Commander: If that is what you want, I can convince others to let you stay.

Commander: Apart from managing the base and giving commands in the field, it's also a commander's duty to recruit competent members for Griffin.

Gr G11: Competent...? Nein, I'm not competent at all.

Commander: Dear me, that's not something for you to decide.

Gr G11: N-Nein... I...I'm not authorized to make such decisions.

Commander: If that's the case, you don't have to give me a reply straight away.

Commander: Why not talk to your leader or the one that's hiring you? Who knows, this probably won't be the last time we meet.

Gr G11: Even if we do meet again, you'll... Oh!

Gr G11 looks down at the candy bucket sitting on her lap. Her eyes flash sharply and she jumps up from her chair.

Gr G11: Um, Commander... What if everyone who participated in this event…gets their memories wiped...because I also took part...

Commander: You are an off-duty T-Doll under Griffin while you're staying at our dormitory. You don't have to worry about that at all.

Commander: You took no part in your squad's mission, nor did the event have anything to do with confidential matters, so no memory wipe is necessary.

Gr G11: (Trembles) But that's not it... This isn't something over which...you...or I...have a say...

Gr G11: I...I scared Gr MP5... I didn't keep my promise to M1919 and Makarov and dozed off at my post...

Gr G11: What if my incompetence causes everyone...to lose their precious memories...

Commander: Okay, but even if what you say is true, and a memory wipe on you and the other T-Dolls is in order, it doesn't matter.

Commander: I won't forget that a special T-Doll called Gr G11 once took part in the Test of Courage event on Halloween at Griffin, because human memory isn't so easily deleted.

Gr G11: Uh...but isn't that gonna be weird?

Commander: How so?

Gr G11: If my neural record gets altered...and we meet again...

Gr G11: Won't there be two of me in your memory? The Gr G11 of Squad 404 and the Gr G11 of Griffin...

Gr G11: The inconsistency and contradiction...would be as if someone you know got kidnapped and replaced by aliens. That would be a disgusting feeling...

Commander: In any case, both of them would be Gr G11.

Commander: All that matters is whether you're willing to be the Gr G11 of Griffin, don't you think?

Gr G11: Me... Gr G11 of Griffin... That isn't so...

Just as Gr G11 is about to say something, she freezes. Then her eyes start blinking rapidly.

Commander: (Encrypted transmission...which means...)

(Thud!) By the time Gr G11 recovers, her candy bucket is already lying on the floor.

Gr G11: U-Um... Commander... I have to report for duty...

Gr G11: Something's happened...and they need me there.

Commander: Your teammates are looking for you?

Gr G11: (Nods) Ja. 416 is already on her way to pick me up.

Gr G11: I need...a place where I can always go home to, and it isn't here after all.

Commander: You forgot these! Don't you want to take your candies to your dorm?

Gr G11: Please give them to M1919 and Makarov!

Gr G11: And please apologize to them for me! I-I shouldn't have fallen asleep...

Gr G11: And...please look after the candies!

Gr G11 leaves behind her reward for tonight and dashes off in a rush. Her dainty figure soon disappears down the hallway.

I bend down and pick up the candy bucket lying on the floor.

Commander: The Gr G11 of Squad 404 and the Gr G11 of Griffin, huh...

Commander: I wonder when the two can become one.
