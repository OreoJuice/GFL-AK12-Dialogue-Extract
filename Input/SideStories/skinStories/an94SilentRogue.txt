...

AN-94: Hailing Ange, please respond if you copy.

AN-94: I have successfully retreated according to Contingency Plan B. The location of the equipment has been uploaded to the shared database.

AN-94: Should I rendezvous with you? Requesting for further directives.

Ange: Copy that. The objective is completed. Withdraw from this sector on your own, AN-94.

AN-94: Understood. Right away.

Ange: After that...

Ange: You're free to do whatever you like.

AN-94: ...Pardon?

Ange: We've finished our business here, AN-94.

Ange: Now that the mission is accomplished, you two can have a day-off.

Ange: Think of it as a vacation and relax.

AN-94: But...

AK-12: Isn't it nice to catch a break every now and then, AN-94?

AN-94: ...Da.

...In a certain safe house.

AK-12: AN-94.

AN-94: I'm here.

AK-12: What are Ange's orders again?

AN-94: "Now that the mission is accomplished, you two can have a day-off."

AK-12: So, you consider sticking to my side like glue a good way to spend your day-off?

AN-94: Have I displeased you, AK-12?

AN-94: I'm sorry...

AK-12: Not exactly.

AK-12: Say, AN-94, every Doll is created for a purpose, right?

AN-94: Da, I was created for you.

AK-12: Using my point against me now... Your mind is becoming more agile, AN-94.

AN-94: I learned this from the Commander, though I believe it would be inappropriate for me to thank you for the praise.

AK-12: That's fine. I don't mind if you do.

AN-94: AK-12...have I done something wrong?

AK-12: What makes you think so?

AN-94: You don't look very happy.

AK-12: I'm not unhappy per se, AN-94.

AK-12: I simply think you should adjust your current state of mind - focus in battle, but learn to relax when you're idle.

AN-94: But I don't know what it means to relax... Does clearing my cache count?

AK-12: You really don't know?

AK-12: That's not what's written on your face.

AN-94: Impossible. My control over my facial expressions have always been...

AN-94: ...Are you bluffing me, AK-12?

AK-12: You've really come a long way.

AK-12: Still, I believe you do know how to "relax" - you've done that before when we ran into them, isn't that right?

AN-94: ...

AN-94: I am at my most relaxed state when I can see that you're safe.

AN-94: Even if it's a day-off, I have no choice but spend it this way.

AK-12: No choice? That's what you fool yourself into thinking.

AK-12: Now you're not worried about offending me?

AN-94: Your face tells me you want me to tell the truth.

AN-94: If it did offend you, I won't mention it again.

AK-12: I'm very interested in what Griffin taught you the last time you met.

AK-12: ...Nyet, you don't have to summarize the whole experience for me right now.

AN-94: I understand.

AK-12: At least you haven't turned into a complete mystery.

AK-12: Anyway, take this.

AN-94: ...?

AK-12: Ange got us invitations to a cocktail party. Take it and go.

AN-94: What is our objective?

AK-12: None whatsoever.

AN-94: Then are there any potential threats that need to be neutralized?

AK-12: Not really.

AK-12: It's just a cocktail party for people to wind down. The Griffins are going to be there as well.

AK-12: Don't you look forward to seeing them again, 94?

AN-94: ...

AK-12: Your cocktail dress is waiting for you. Resume your education in the art of relaxation.

AN-94: I believe you are more suited to attending this kind of event.

AK-12: Unlike you, I've graduated from such training.

AK-12: Listen, AN-94. Don't pigeonhole yourself.

AK-12: Drawing a circle and confining yourself within it will only make your neural cloud rust away. You've got to widen your horizons and experience things that you aren't familiar with.

AN-94: But...

AK-12: That's an order.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: Understood. I will attend the event on time.

The night before the cocktail party.

AN-94, having been explicitly forbidden to follow AK-12 around, sits in the safe house.

AN-94: (Where has AK-12 gone? I can't check on her real-time coordinates when we aren't on a mission. She'll get cross if she finds out.)

AN-94: (Still, my neural cloud just can't be at peace when I have no knowledge of her whereabouts...)

AN-94: Must I learn to overcome this...?

AN-94: (I'm attending the cocktail party on my own... Without her there with me, what am I going to do?)

AN-94 gets to her feet and paces around the safe house.

AN-94: (Just the thought of not keeping AK-12 within sight makes me uneasy.)

AN-94: (There are other ways to keep track of her, but she'll probably get angry if she finds out...)

AN-94: (Ange mentioned that she's stored a few spare bodies for our use just in case...)

AN-94: (...I'll just have to be extra careful and make sure she doesn't find out.)

AN-94 bends down in a corner and flips open a floorboard plank.

As she expected, the hidden mechanism reveals a row of Doll bodies.

AN-94: (This is AK-12's.)

AN-94: (She looks so peaceful in her sleep. How unlike her.)

Once she's confirmed the body's identity, AN-94 carefully carries it out of storage and puts it into a case that she's prepared.

AN-94: I'll put you back once it's over.

AN-94: Please keep me company just this once.

Right then, a set of footsteps are fast approaching. AN-94 snaps the case shut and sits primly on it.

AK-12: I'm back.

AN-94: Welcome back.

AK-12: That case...

AN-94: ...

AK-12: You seem all prepared.

AK-12: I'll take the night watch. Get some rest before the cocktail party tomorrow.

AN-94: ...Phew. You're right.

AN-94: (I shouldn't have packed the case so early. Thank goodness I didn't get found out.)

AK-12: Dobroy nochi, AN-94.

AK-12: What an interesting thing to do.

AK-12: Lovely. Looks like I can plan an even better "surprise"...

The following evening at the venue of the cocktail party.

Security guard: Griffin personnel, right? This way, please.

AN-94: Thank you.

AN-94: (Fighting in this dress will be really awkward. And these heels... I need to allocate more computational capacity to stabilize my body...)

AN-94: (So this is the anniversary cocktail party. Looks pretty secure. Everyone seems very relaxed.)

Chef: Hey, Miss! Would you like to try these freshly made desserts?

AN-94: Uh...are you talking to me?

Chef: Yes, you, lady in the black and burgundy dress.

Chef: This must be your first cocktail party, am I right? Then please, you must give my handiwork a taste.

AN-94: Thank you.

AN-94: ...The sweet and slightly sour strawberries perfectly counter the heaviness of the cream. The toppings create a wonderful texture along with the cupcake.

Chef: You're really a connoisseur!

Chef: This dessert is named "The Third Color Rivaled by None".

AN-94: "In-between the colors of Moon and Snow//You would be the third color rivaled by none"... This name is a reference to a really old poem, isn't it?

Chef: Oh? So you know the origin.

Chef: Yeah, you do remind me of the lady that suggested the name.

AN-94: You didn't name the dessert?

Chef: No, she did.

The chef gestures toward two people engaging in conversation nearby.

AN-94: (That's the Griffin Commander and...searching...match found...Tactical Doll Thunder.)

AN-94: (I didn't expect anyone else to be this well-versed in ancient poetry. Will she get along with AK-12?)

Chef: Miss?

Chef: Come and try some of the other desserts! This one, for example, is my personal pride and joy. That lady named it "Bitter Rock'n'Roll"!

AN-94: ...

AN-94: I'm sorry, but there's something I need to do.

Chef: Huh? Please, be my guest...

AN-94: (I spaced out for just a little while, where has my case with AK-12's body gone?)

AN-94: (How could anyone take the case away without my knowledge...? Was I too relaxed? Nyet, I've got to get it back!)

AN-94 snaps into focus and scans the entire venue for the signal emitted by the case.

AN-94: (...Target located. There it is!)

AN-94 jogs over to the case.

AN-94: (Thank goodness it wasn't taken away...)

AN-94: (...Hold on, it's too light. Is the body not inside?)

AN-94: (Did someone remove it...? Nyet, could any of the humans here be after Doll bodies?)

AN-94: (I've got to find it soon!)

???: Hey, you! The cute one!

???: Your cocktail dress is stunning, and there's a lot of depth to the way the red changes in shade! Mind if I snap a pic?

???: I wanna get myself something like that later...

AN-94: (This is Griffin T-Doll...MDR.)

AN-94: (Why now of all times? I don't have time for this.)

AN-94: Uh...um...I can't...

MDR: My, don't be shy! You're really cute and photogenic!

MDR: If it makes you feel less self-conscious, we can take a selfie together!

AN-94: I'm sorry, but I really...

Commander: What are you doing here, MDR?

MDR: Oh, Commander! You showed up at the perfect time. I'm looking into...

Commander: Isn't this AN-94? Do the two of you know each other?

AN-94: Good evening, Commander... What on earth...

AN-94: ...should I do about the case...?

AK-12: It would seem that 94's circle of friends has expanded considerably while I wasn't looking.

AN-94: AK-12?! You...!

AK-12 winks at her.

What is that supposed to mean? The shell-shocked AN-94 finds it utterly incomprehensible.

She instinctively keeps her mouth shut and watches as AK-12 deftly helps her out of a tight spot by shifting everyone's attention onto herself.

AN-94: (AK-12 can always make things go her way.)

AN-94: (...At least, I now have a chance to look for the lost body... However, it's offline and can't be located. I'll just have to search for it with my eyes.)

AK-12: 94?

AN-94: I'm here.

AK-12: Texas Hold 'Em is only fun with multiple players. Come along.

Commander: You organized such an event without telling me...? I knew it wasn't a coincidence that you and AN-94 came.

AN-94: (Crap. Now I can't start my search.)

AN-94: (The longer I get delayed, the less likely I'll be able to find the body. What should I do?)

AN-94: (I can't possibly refuse AK-12's request, so I suppose I don't really have a choice...)

AN-94: (Start compiling data regarding "Texas Hold 'Em".)

Despite her unease, the game goes on - even though it is taking even longer than she expected.

At long last, the cocktail party comes to an end. While AK-12 is bidding the Commander farewell, AN-94 seizes the opportunity to search the exterior of the venue with the empty case in tow.

AN-94: (Oh, AK-12 got in touch. I am to meet her in the parking lot in five minutes.)

AN-94: (This is my last chance. If I still can't find it...)

Commander: Good evening, AN-94.

AN-94: (It's the Commander.)

AN-94: (Griffin is in charge of the security of this venue... Perhaps it'll be more efficient if I ask the Commander directly.)

AN-94: Dobryy vecher, Commander.

AN-94: This may be an abrupt question, but...have you seen anyone leaving the venue with a Doll body?

Commander: A Doll body?

Commander: That would draw a lot of attention on a cocktail party, wouldn't it? No, I haven't.

AN-94: How can that be...?

AN-94: Don't tell me it isn't here anymore...?

Commander: Are the two of you investigating something?

AN-94: Nyet.

AN-94: Please forget what I said.

Commander: Alright, I know better than to try fishing information out of you.

Commander: Did you have fun?

AN-94: It's been fascinating.

AN-94: I have gathered samples...regarding methods of human and Doll relaxation.

Commander: I take it you enjoyed the experience?

AN-94: Da, you are correct.

AN-94: I still don't believe any of these methods can be applied to myself, but...

AN-94: I do think I managed to derive a bit of "fun" from the process of competition and computation.

Commander: That sounds like something AK-12 would say.

AN-94: Really?

AN-94: AK-12 said I'm becoming more and more like you.

Commander: In any case, you've certainly changed, AN-94.

AN-94: For the better, I hope?

Commander: It was meant as a compliment.

AN-94: Then...I'm glad to hear it.

AN-94: Sorry, Commander, but there's something I absolutely have to find. Excuse me.

Commander: Need my help?

AN-94: ...You already have.

AN-94: Spasibo. Do svidaniya.

Commander: See you next time... I know I will.

Commander: As long as you stop organizing strange competitions, you're always welcome to visit.

She stops in her tracks and turns back.

AN-94: I think I'll take you up on your offer...

AN-94: I also look forward to our next meeting.

The corners of her mouth are perfectly still, but there's a twinkle in her eyes.

...Is she smiling?

AN-94: Then I'll be taking my leave.

AN-94 walks off. She seems a bit unsteady on her feet. Is it because of the heels?

I wonder when I'll see her again. With great anticipation, I see her off from where I'm standing.
