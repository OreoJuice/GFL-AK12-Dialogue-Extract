Inside the Griffin base.

This one might be a little troublesome...

As I walk through the base, I ponder the mission I have received earlier.

An internationally renowned wedding designer has requested the loan of several Dolls from Griffin to model for a fashion show.

While we've had similar missions in the past, the idea of borrowing Tactical Dolls from a PMC makes me curious as to how the artistic mind works.

Unlike before, the client has further specified that the Dolls need to have "character", that they would have to "stand out from the crowd at a glance", and other such requirements.

Still, the request needs to be met, even if the countless provisions riding on it are somewhat problematic. After all, the payment for this request is very generous.

...If I'm not careful in my choice of candidates our losses would be severe.

...Commander.

I turn back, toward the source of the voice.

The eye-catching red hair of the Doll before me leaps into my field of vision.

T-5000: Commander, I'm here to deliver the report for our team's logistics mission.

That's it!

T-5000: Huh?

...Several minutes later.

T-5000: So you want me...to be a fashion model?!

Yes.

T-5000: But...why do we have to go? Aren't we Tactical Dolls?

According to the client, Tactical Dolls better suit the design theme of this fashion show.

T-5000: But I don't have any experience with this sort of thing...

The mission itself isn't difficult. There'll be people to guide you along the way.

All you need to do is follow directions from the staff. It's much easier than normal operations!

T-5000: But...

If you take part in this mission, you'll have a chance to "transform"!

Plus, the bonus for completing the mission is very good.

T-5000: What was that, did you say I can "transform"?

T-5000: Ahem, wait...however...

T-5000 frowns slightly.

After a brief silence, she raises her head and looks me straight in the eye.

T-5000: I'm sorry, Commander.

T-5000: I don't really want to accept this mission after all.

Er...why is that?

T-5000: I look distinctive enough as it is. If people take pictures of me and they end up on TV, won't that mean the entire world will know about me?

T-5000: That would be a fatal blow to the professional career of a sniper!

Actually, it might not go as viral as you think...

T-5000: It's hard enough for me to keep a low profile as it is, so I don't really want to do something so attention-seeking.

T-5000: Please find someone else, Commander.

...

T-5000: If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

(No, I can't just give up like this!)

(That's right...since it's T-5000...)

As T-5000 is about to turn and leave, I deliberately raise my voice and sigh heavily.

Sighhhhhh...

T-5000 freezes in place.

(It seems to be working. In that case...)

Oh man, what a headache...

T-5000: Commander, why are you sighing all of a sudden?

The fashion show is drawing closer and closer, but I just can't make up the numbers... Oh, woe is me.

T-5000: Aren't there enough Dolls in the base for that?

I can't complete this mission by picking just any Doll.

There aren't many who meet the requirements to begin with, and now there's one fewer candidate...

T-5000: ...

(Sighs) I'll need to submit a list of names to the client in a couple of days. What am I going to do now...?

If we can't complete the mission, we'll end up losing out on a huge sum and we'll have to pay the penalty clause for a breach of contract...

T-5000: Ahem... Commander, please calm down and listen to me!

Hm?

T-5000: One of the messages of Crimson Soul Kamen is that you must protect the smiles of people around you!

(That's right, that's it...)

What do you mean?

T-5000: After seeing you so depressed, I just can't leave things as they are.

T-5000: So I'll take this mission!

This is wonderful! You've been a big help, T-5000!

I have something to do so I need to go now, bye!

T-5000: Wait a minute, Commander?! You haven't told me what we'll be doing next!

T-5000: Where are you rushing off to?

I'll give you the mission details later.

Right now, I need to find partners for a hero!

With that, I swiftly leave the corridor.

(I feel bad about leaving T-5000 all confused back there, but I can't give her a chance to change her mind.)

(Alright, that's another one in the bag. Now I need to think about the other candidates...)

...

......

Soon, all the models have been chosen, and the mission officially begins.

After half a month, it is finally time for the Doll models to take the stage.

Two hours before the fashion show.

T-5000 stands in front of the mirror in the dressing room and examines her appearance.

T-5000: This "transformation" is completely different from what I imagined...

What's different?

Before the person next her can finish speaking, T-5000 has already dropped her bouquet and pointed her sniper rifle in the direction of the voice.

After seeing that it is PKP, she sighs helplessly and puts her gun down.

T-5000: ...PKP, don't just suddenly pop up out of nowhere.

PKP: A sniper shouldn't be startled by this kind of thing.

T-5000: I wasn't startled, but I almost shot you on reflex.

PKP: That's fine. Besides, our guns aren't loaded, so they're nothing more than stage props.

T-5000: That's not what I mean... (Sighs)

T-5000: Forget it. Are you here for whatever reason?

PKP: Not really. It's just that the fashion show's about to begin, but one of my fellow models is still busy scowling at the mirror and muttering to herself.

PKP: I don't want anything to spoil an otherwise perfect show, so I came over to see what you're up to.

T-5000: Sigh... Something has been feeling off ever since I took the mission...

...

T-5000 briefly describes the events which led to her accepting the mission from the Commander.

PKP: I see...

PKP: It seems the commander's gone to a great deal of trouble to make us take up the job willingly.

T-5000: So, you also think the commander was faking it back then?

PKP: Does it matter?

T-5000: Well...

PKP: Even if that was true, you're here right now, aren't you?

T-5000 stares dumbly at PKP. Her mouth opens and closes a few times, as though she's about to say something.

Just then, a staff member enters the room in a rush.

Miss PKP, we need to make some adjustments to your jewelry...

PKP: Alright, I'll head over now.

PKP turns to follow the staff member. Just before she strides away, she glances around the corner.

PKP: T-5000, if this is bothering you so much, then find the person in question and get things straight.

PKP: The Commander should be happy to answer your questions in order to see this mission successfully completed.

T-5000: Right, spasibo.

PKP leaves. T-5000 picks up her discarded bouquet, then she walks toward the corner of the backstage corridor.

T-5000: Aren't you going to come out, Commander?

Haha...you spotted me after all.

I step out from around the corner and stand before T-5000.

T-5000: Honestly, since when did you pick up the habit of eavesdropping on people?

I'm sorry...it wasn't on purpose.

You were talking to PKP and I didn't want to interrupt.

T-5000: Nevermind. You've saved me the effort of looking for you.

T-5000: So...I assume...you heard me mouthing off about you, right?

Well, I don't think it's all that bad...

And to be honest, I'm the one who should be apologizing to you.

T-5000: What are you talking about, Commander...

T-5000 looks at me, then she suddenly giggles.

T-5000: I'm not here to accuse you of anything.

What? Then you were looking for me because...

T-5000: When I was talking to PKP just now, I came to a few realizations.

T-5000: I think they're pretty important, so I want to tell you about them, Commander.

So what have you come to realize?

T-5000: While this "transformation" isn't the kind of "transformation" I'm familiar with... I'm very happy that I could be of service.

T-5000: And also...

T-5000: If you really need me, you ought to be more honest about it.

T-5000: Crimson Soul Kamen will never refuse someone who's truly in need!

T-5000: I'm the same way too.

I understand, T-5000... Thank you.

T-5000: Whew... I feel much better now.

T-5000: I'll be off then. The show's about to begin.

I'm counting on you, T-5000.

T-5000: Don't worry, Commander. You can leave it all to me.

T-5000 scoops up the bouquet in her hands and flashes me a confident smile.

T-5000: Now then, sit back and watch...as I "transform" on stage!
