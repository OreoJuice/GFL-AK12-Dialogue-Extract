AK-12, do you read me? I'm picking up signals from other T-Dolls in this area.

AK-12: Received. They're Griffin signals. No need to worry.

AN-94: Understood.

AN-94: ...But if they came to recover our mission objective as well...

AK-12: Hmm...that's definitely a possibility. No need to worry, I'll take care of it.

AN-94: Alright. I'll continue searching.

AN-94: Any further instructions?

AK-12: Nyet.

AK-12: Feel free to relax and take a break. We've been given a very generous amount of time for this mission.

AN-94: I do not understand what qualifies as relaxing.

AN-94: Also, the time we have is not generous. We have other things to do.

AK-12: ...

AN-94: ...Do you not think so, AK-12?

AN-94: Then I will try to learn how to relax.

AK-12: You can make your own decisions and think independently to some extent, you know.

AK-12: What do you think relaxing is like?

AN-94: Relaxing, hmm... The definition is "becoming less tense with respect to one's mindfulness or control of a situation."

AN-94: Does that mean I should sleep? Carry out another mission? Adjust my operational tempo?

AK-12: ...A boring answer, as I expected.

AN-94: But...a T-Doll's actions all run on programmed logic.

AK-12: You're right. After all, this isn't something that can be changed just by talking about it.

AK-12: I can see the Griffin Commander.

AK-12: See you in a bit. It's your free time, AN-94.

...AK-12 ends the transmission.

AN-94: My free time? AK-12?

AN-94: ...Then what should I do now?

AN-94: In any case...I'll continue searching in the water.

AN-94: AK-12, I did not find our target on the seabed nearby. I am heading towards the shallows to continue the search...

(The shallows... Uh...that's also where those Griffin T-Dolls are moving around...)

(Judging from the nearby signals, there's a T-Doll with a human, as well as a...)

(Huh? There's something close by them... It's a...)

AN-94: ...

AN-94: (It should be okay if I just go over to look, right?)

...AN-94 tries to swim a little closer.

AN-94: (That's...)

Human voice: So it wasn't "helplessness" after all...

Female voice: Hmm? Were you saying something, Commander?

Human voice: Ah, it's nothing, it's nothing.

Human voice: On the other hand, I learned today that you're the sort of Doll who likes to explore the unknown, FAL.

AN-94: (That's..!)

...AN-94 can see a white ferret draped lazily over a swim ring through the surface of the water.

AN-94: (Is it asleep? Will I scare it if I approach it now?)

...After staring at it for a while from under the water, AN-94 decides to venture out of the water and reaches out toward the lazy ferret.

FAL: Whoaaaaa! What's this?!

AN-94: (Ah! Dang it. The T-Doll spotted me first!)

AN-94: (And I was so close to touching it—)

FAL: (Screams) W-w-w-what are you doing?!!!

...FAL reflexively raises her gun.

AN-94: (It's all my fault... This shouldn't have been necessary!)

...AN94 raises her gun as well.

The Commander sees the confrontation and immediately jumps in. FAL is pushed into the water from her swim ring.

AN-94: (Huh...? Why did the Commander...?)

FAL: Commander glub glub blub blub blub blub... (Coughs)

AN-94: (Ah, the ferret!)

AN-94: (The ferret is sinking... Huh? It can actually swim! How is it so agile?)

AN-94: (Since it's in the water...then...then I can...)

FAL: What are you doing, Commander?! I almost got water in my slushie!

FAL: And what was that just now?! Th-th-there was a hand—

Commander: —It was a sea monster!

FAL: ...Hah?

...

The next morning, in a hidden spot near the beach.

AN-94: ...It felt really soft. I wonder if they're going into the water today as well.

Commander: Do you want to touch it again?

AN-94: Nyet... AK-12 didn't give me orders to that effect.

AN-94: ...Huh? What are you doing here, Commander?

Commander: Don't underestimate me. Finding a base like this was easy as pie.

Commander: Did you like stroking Fel?

AN-94: Fel?

Commander: That's the name of FAL's ferret. At least, I think it's a ferret.

AN-94: I...was wearing gloves at the time, so I didn't feel anything special.

AN-94: But it was moderately soft, and I guess its fur must be very sleek.

Commander: I once tried to stroke it, too, but FAL wouldn't allow it, and the ferret itself also avoids me like the plague.

Commander: My... The more I talk about it, the more I envy you.

AN-94: Back then, I just wanted to make sure...

Commander: FAL was frightened by what you did.

Commander: While everything turned out alright in the end, things were really dangerous at the time. You were both about to fight and all.

AN-94: It's true that approaching the T-Doll and the ferret was not part of the mission. I've already submitted a reflection report to AK-12. I made trouble for her...

Commander: Oh, it's not that bad. All's well that ends well.

Commander: 12 should have understood. She didn't scold you, did she?

AN-94: ...She didn't.

Commander: You seem puzzled. She must have said something else to you, right?

AN-94: AK-12...

AN-94: She didn't scold me. Instead she praised me for interacting with the ferret, and said it would be even better if I came to interact more with others through the animal, but I don't understand...

Commander: She's very worried about you. What do you think?

AN-94: I don't understand what she means. Maybe that's how I'm different from AK-12.

AN-94: I was made for AK-12. She's the reason for my existence...

AN-94: Leaving her and thinking independently is akin to disobeying orders.

Commander: (Mutters) That's exactly what she is worried about.

Commander: And what did AK-12 say about this?

AN-94: AK-12 said...our future was too uncertain, and that even if we were Task Force DEFY, we couldn't let the slightest chance go by.

AN-94: But I think there's nothing AK-12 can't handle and that all I need to do is follow her plans.

Commander: If I were the one who told you that, I would very much like you to truly understand the meaning behind those words.

Commander: Have you ever thought about not looking to AK-12 for instructions and finding the best answer based on your judgment alone?

AN-94: AK-12 once asked me to do something like that...

AN-94: "You can make your own decisions and think independently to some extent, you know," was what she said. She also asked me to consider the definition of relaxation.

Commander: I didn't think she'd actually say that.

AN-94: But doesn't relaxing mean going to sleep or moving on to another mission?

Commander: It is if you think it is.

Commander: At the very least, that's a conclusion you've reached, so you should believe in it.

AN-94: But AK-12 said—

Commander: While I'm not sure why DEFY is here, I'm guessing that touching the ferret wasn't something 12 had you do. Am I right?

AN-94: ...It was not. But that does not...

Commander: Are you refuting me on her orders too?

AN-94: ...

AN-94: ...Nyet.

Commander: Then I think you've already taken your first step.

AN-94: ...There are still some things I don't understand.

AN-94: Are the things I said in keeping with basic logic?

AN-94: Don't tell me...

Commander: There's still some time. Go ahead and ask your questions.

AN-94: ...Nyet, it's nothing. Spasibo, Commander. I'm fine.

Commander: Alright, it's about time, anyway.

AN-94: ...

Gr G36: Commander? I've been searching for you for some time now. So that's where you are.

Gr G36: Everyone's gathered, so may I ask if we will be returning now?

Commander: Right, I'm heading over. Is everything alright with you, Gr G36?

Gr G36: Please do not be worried. I am in excellent condition.

Commander: Right, let's go.

After Griffin leaves, beside a huge rock on the beach.

AK-12: AN-94, how are things on your end?

AN-94: Ah, da, the retrieval is complete.

AN-94: Although, after examining the surroundings, it would seem somebody tossed it into the ocean just yesterday,

AN-94: Still, the target is in good condition, and I'm executing the storage procedure on it now.

AK-12: So this is what our higher-ups wanted us to dredge up from the bottom of the sea... This wreckage looks just as worthless as it did in the pictures. What's the point in studying it, I wonder?

AK-12: 94, is something on your mind?

AN-94: Nyet, I'm relaxing.

AK-12: Relaxing, is it? How interesting, it seems you've gotten the hang of it.

AN-94: ...Is this relaxation? It feels like it's affecting my efficiency.

AK-12: Don't just admit it...

AN-94: Since you say so, it must be true, AK-12.

AK-12: Honestly, aren't we back to where we started now?

AK-12: You're such a bore.

AN-94: ...Is that so?

AN-94: The procedure is complete. AK-12.

AK-12: Alright, now all we have to do is wait for the other team to pick us up!

AK-12: Did you run into anything interesting along the way?

AN-94: I met the Griffin Commander.

AN-94: The Commander told me roughly the same thing you did, and asked me to think for myself.

AK-12: Quite an interesting individual after all. Looks like I was right about this human.

AK-12: So, what do you think?

AN-94: I talked back at the Commander, and the Commander questioned me in turn.

AN-94: My neural cloud could not predict the logical conditions which the Commander was using. The Commander's discourse seemed logically sound, but there were also paradoxes which I could not reconcile.

AK-12: Isn't that good?

AK-12: Do more thinking, AN-94. You're a cutting edge T-Doll produced alongside me.

AN-94: ...But how should I do it?

AK-12: I don't know. Isn't that every T-Doll's own business?

AN-94: Understood.

...

AN-94: (But what is this sense of confusion that I can't quite articulate...)

AN-94: (What is this concept of independent thinking, anyway?)

AN-94: (I have no idea...but it feels like I've gained a lead towards it.)

AN-94: (Will I be able to find the answer before I meet the Commander again?)
