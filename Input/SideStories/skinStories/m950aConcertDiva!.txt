...A day before the anniversary banquet.

At the Griffin base.

Commander: Time to check on the preparations for the anniversary banquet.

Commander: Although this wasn't my responsibility in the first place...

Kalin: Ahh! I'm totally swamped!

Kalin: Besides managing the daily supplies, I also have to prepare the things for the party...

Kalin: And we have to take care of the preparations for the banquet as well! Miss Helian is expecting too much from us!

Kalin: Commander, could you do me a favor and head over to the banquet hall?

Kalin: I'm really too busy to do it myself...

Commander: Although I did agree to help, but...

I look at the two large boxes placed next to the wall. Inside are decorations with the company's logo that need to be properly arranged in the banquet hall tonight.

Commander: Looks like I'll have to get a helper after all.

Commander: Now then, the T-Doll with the most time to spare is...

A few minutes later.

M950A: Were you looking for me, Commander?

Commander: Yep, I need you to do something with me.

Commander: We need to bring these two boxes to the venue of tomorrow's banquet.

M950A: Doing some heavy-lifting then? Sure.

M950A readily agrees and walks toward the two large boxes.

She grabs the handles on the boxes and easily picks them up.

Commander: (She seems unexpectedly enthusiastic...)

M950A: What is it, Commander?

M950A: Aren't we going?

Commander: ...Ah, yes.

Commander: Let's go.

...One hour later.

At the hotel.

I finish my discussion with the hotel manager and return to the banquet hall.

Commander: Sorry to keep you waiting, 950.

Commander: Um... Where's the stuff that we brought over?

M950A: I've already handed them over to the staff. They said that they'll start decorating in a short while.

Commander: Oh?

M950A: Is something the matter?

Commander: No...it's nothing. It's just that I didn't expect you to be so ethusiastic about this.

Commander: It should be your first time coming here, right? Want to check the place out?

M950A: No need. I've already explored the place while you were away.

M950A: Besides, I'll be here again tomorrow.

Commander: Oh, that's right, I forgot that your name is on the guest list for the banquet.

M950A: By the way, Commander...

M950A hesitates for a bit. I follow her line of sight and see a small stage on one side of the hall. She seems to be particularly fixated on the microphone in the middle of the stage.

M950A: Can I ask you a question?

Commander: What is it?

M950A: Was a band hired for tomorrow's banquet?

Commander: There should be.

M950A: I see... Perhaps the banquet tomorrow will be more interesting than I thought.

Commander: Are you interested in the band?

M950A: I suppose you could say that.

M950A: If there's gonna a band, then perhaps...

Commander: Perhaps?

M950A: ...Nevermind.

M950A: Let's go, Commander.

Alright.

(M950A seems to be hiding something... I'll find a chance to ask her about it tomorrow.)

The next day.

During the anniversary banquet.

Commander: Phew... Even I'm feeling a bit tired at such an occasion.

Commander: Let me find a quiet spot to take a rest...

As I make my way across the banquet hall, I see the small stage from yesterday.

Right now, the indoor band is performing a soothing melody that complements the banquet's atmosphere.

Commander: Come to think of it...I haven't seen M950A since the banquet started.

Commander: Let me go look for her.

...Ten minutes later.

Commander: Looks like she's not in the banquet hall.

Commander: Hmm, she seemed very interested in that microphone yesterday...

I leave the banquet hall after asking a staff member a few questions.

In the hotel's storage room.

M950A: Socket... Socket...

M950A: I don't see any here... How about...

Commander: M950A, what're you doing here?

M950A: Ah! Commander... Why are you here?!

Commander: To look for you, of course.

Commander: ...What are you doing with that microphone?

M950A: Err...I-I-I'm...

M950A: I'm looking for a power socket!

Commander: Huh?

M950A: I wanted to try the microphone here...

Commander: What for?

M950A: The banquet was a bit boring, so I wanted to pass some time here...

M950A: I'll return before the banquet ends!

Commander: That's no good, you can't use the facilities in the hotel without permission.

Commander: Not to mention, the banquet is still going on...so you can't make any weird noises.

M950A: We're pretty far away from the main hall, so it should be fine, right?

Commander: That's not the problem here, 950...

Commander: This is a very important event for the company, so let's do our best ensure its success, okay?

Commander: Besides, I'm sure you know that not every T-Doll had the opportunity to be invited.

M950A: ...I understand, Commander.

M950A: I'm sorry. It's just that the banquet isn't what I expected it to be, so I...don't know what I could do there.

Commander: Did you want to...sing on that stage?

M950A: Yeah... I'm actually not very good at socializing...

M950A: To me, it's easier to get people's attention by singing.

M950A: I originally thought that I would have a chance to sing here, but I guess not...

M950A: But then again...a T-Doll wouldn't be allowed to sing at a banquet like this in the first place anyway.

Commander: Is that so...

Commander: Your wish might come true later tonight, though.

M950A: Huh?

Commander: There will be a special party after the banquet ends.

Commander: You can do whatever you want to your heart's content there tonight.

M950A: Alright...

M950A: Looks like I can't miss the party tonight.

After that, I return to the banquet hall with M950A.

...

The night of the anniversary celebration.

The party is coming to an end, and the booming caf√© is starting to quiet down.

M950A: ...It's time.

M950A rises from her seat in the corner.

She steps across several T-Dolls snoring on the floor and heads straight towards the stage that was set up just for her. At least she herself thinks so.

M950A: ...Okay, no problems with the microphone and the speakers.

M950A fiddles with the music player and the soothing melody is replaced by a dynamic rhythm.

M950A: Everyone!

M950A: This night of yours, are you calling it quits already?!

The T-Dolls turn their heads to look at M950A.

Welcoming the gazes of the crowd, she lifts her head with confidence and grabs onto the microphone in front of her.

M950A: Listen to my song!

M950A begins to sing.

Some drunken T-Dolls are awakened by her passionate singing.

Mosin-Nagant: Ugh...hit me...hit me with another one! 416!

416: Heh...you think I...I'd lose to you?

416: No matter the circumstances...I'll always...be the best!

Mosin-Nagant: Then let's continue...

416: I...I'm game...

416: Where's the booze? Get me some booze!

WA2000: ...You guys! Drink all you want, but don't start flipping tables!

M950A: That's right, just like this...

M950A: Enjoy this wondrous night with my singing!

WA2000: This is too much!

WA2000: Argh... You're being too loud!

WA2000: Someone stop them!

Skorpion: That looks like fun! I want to sing too!

Skorpion: M950A! Let me sing too!

M950A: This is MY stage, I'm not giving it away that easily!

Skorpion: So stingy... Then, I'll just have to take it by force!

In the midst of M950A's singing, the waning party came back to life.

Springfield: Should we stop them, Commander?

Commander: Let them enjoy themselves tonight...as long as they don't cause too much damage.

I look towards M950A. She is fighting for the microphone with several other T-Dolls while singing a song that belongs just to her.

Commander: Besides...

Commander: It's pretty nice to appreciate the magic brought about through singing from time to time, don't you think?
