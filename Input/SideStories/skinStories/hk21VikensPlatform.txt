...

...It's been two hours since the Christmas party ended.

Commander: Everyone should be asleep by now... (Yawns) I guess I should get some rest myself.

Commander: Things sure were rowdy tonight... I guess everyone was looking forward to an opportunity to let loose like this.

Commander: I should be grateful Christmas exists, for giving them a chance to do just that.

Commander: Hm... And that's the end of it.

Commander: Come to think of it, there was really no need for me to be in such a rush to do this... It would have been fine to take care of it tomorrow. "Work is life", as they say.

Commander: Springfield must have also turned in as well... Otherwise I could have gone in for a cup...hm?

???: ...Shhhh! Not so loud!

Suddenly, someone appears before me... It's HMG21.

HMG21: ...

Commander: You scared the hell out of me... Don't just appear out of nowhere without any warning, HMG21.

The way HMG21 suddenly emerges from the shadows of the doorway has a striking resemblance to Santa Claus.

Commander: ...Santa Claus?

Commander: Wait a minute...What are you doing here? If I remember correctly... You're in charge of delivering presents, aren't you?

Commander: CAWS should have given them to you, right?

HMG21 suddenly looks uneasy.

HMG21: I...

Commander: I...?

HMG21: ...I'm sorry.

...

Some time earlier.

HMG21: Wow... This pile of presents looks really impressive...

HMG21: Good thing each box has their recipient's name on it... I'd never be able to remember what belongs to whom in my neural cloud.

The presents HMG21 received from CAWS are piled up like a miniature mountain in HMG21's room.

HMG21: It looks like it's wobbling... It's not going to fall over, is it?

HMG21: Usually... I wouldn't even think about taking on such a troublesome job... It's just that this time...

HMG21: I won't let anyone else have the right to personally give Big Sis her Christmas presents!

HMG21: Will she praise me...or say something like, "Danke, HMG21," or something...?

HMG21: (Squeals in delight)

HMG21: ...No, I can't let my imagination run wild.

HMG21: I'll celebrate later. There's a mountain of work that still needs doing...literally.

HMG21: That's right, I'll pick out Big Sis' present first!

HMG21: I'll save it for last...or should I give it to her first?

HMG21: No, I can't, that'll wipe out my motivation to work... No matter what, I took this job, so I have to finish it.

HMG21: Ah...found it!

HMG21 looks at Gr G3's present.

HMG21: I can't believe CAWS bought this for Big Sis... No, it was probably the Commander's idea.

HMG21: There's no way CAWS would understand Sis that well.

HMG21: While it's a bit of a shame that I couldn't take part in picking out her gift myself, it turned out well, so I can't really complain about the result.

HMG21: ...Hm? Vixen?

This is the fox robot "Vixen", named after one of Santa's reindeers.

The Commander specially assigned it to HMG21 in order to help with her tasks.

HMG21: I was just wondering where you'd gotten to. I'm glad you came back in time for work.

HMG21: I wouldn't be able to move this many presents without your help.

Vixen: Beep— beep—

HMG21: Vixen! Don't run around! You'll knock down the presents!

Vixen seems very excited for some reason and keeps jumping up and down through the room.

The already unstable mound of presents looks like it's ready to collapse at any moment.

HMG21: What's gotten into you all of a sudden...huh?

HMG21: What's that present you're holding in your mouth... Wait, don't touch that!

As HMG21 freezes for a moment, Vixen bumps into a corner of the present mountain.

HMG21: Aieeee!

...

HMG21: And that's what happened...

Commander: ...

Commander: So you're saying you passed out until just now?

HMG21: ...I'm very sorry about this.

Commander: No...that's no big deal. The important thing is that you're not hurt. Besides, it's not too late yet.

Commander: While it's a shame that you missed the party, don't you think this is nice for getting the job done?

Commander: There's no need to apologize.

Commander: And it's true, I didn't see you at the Christmas party.

Commander: However, not everyone was going to come in the first place, so I was not particularly bothered by it. It's just bad luck.

HMG21: Actually...there's another, worse problem.

Commander: A worse problem?

Commander: Let me guess, are the presents damaged?

HMG21: Nonono, it's not that bad yet.

HMG21: If I really damaged the presents, I wouldn't know how to explain myself.

HMG21: Actually...

HMG21 looks away. She seems hesitant to speak.

HMG21: Can I...ask you to keep this matter a secret from Big Sis?

Commander: ...Just from Gr G3?

HMG21: I don't care what the others think.

Commander: You and that personality of yours... Forget it, I promise I won't tell her.

Commander: So, what's the matter?

HMG21: ...

HMG21: ...I checked the presents after I woke up.

HMG21: I was very lucky...none of them were damaged.

HMG21: However, their labels were a mess.

Commander: Their labels? Ah...

Commander: I see, so that's what it is. I understand.

Commander: Is that why you came looking for me?

HMG21: Ja...

HMG21: I have no idea where each present goes now...

HMG21: The only people in the whole world that can help me tell the difference are CAWS and you, Commander.

Commander: Why do you make it sound like some cloak and dagger thing...

Commander: Alright, I understand why you've come looking for me. You want me to help you send the presents, right? That was a wise decision. I know who each present goes to even without the labels.

Commander: However, why didn't you ask CAWS?

HMG21: I don't want to.

Commander: ...I guess. That's just the way you are.

HMG21: Am I being too pushy?

HMG21: Are you tired now, Commander?

Commander: No, I'm full of energy.

Commander: Also, I can't let you go back like this since you've come all this way to look for me.

HMG21: ...

HMG21: ...You're just acting cool.

Vixen: Beep— beep—

Commander: ...Oh, come on!

Commander: I'm serious about helping you, HMG21! Also, I just drank some coffee, so I AM full of energy.

HMG21: Hm...

Commander: Fine, let's go, then!

HMG21: Wait...hold on.

Commander: Hm? What's the matter?

HMG21: Actually...there's one more thing.

Commander: One more thing? What else is there besides the labels getting mixed up?

HMG21: Right... Didn't I tell you just now?

HMG21: Vixen started acting strangely after it entered my room.

Commander: Ah, now that you mention it... Vixen shouldn't be doing this sort of thing for no reason.

Vixen: Beep—

Commander: I'm not going to cover for you, you'd better give her a proper apology.

Vixen: Beep...

HMG21: Back then, Vixen ran in with a present I'd never seen before in its mouth.

HMG21: I was taken by surprise and couldn't stop it in time.

Commander: A present you've never seen before?

HMG21: That's right, so I checked that all the presents were okay first.

HMG21: And then I checked how many presents there were.

Commander: ...And some were missing?

HMG21: Quite the opposite, actually... I found that there was one extra.

Commander: ...One extra?

HMG21: That's right.

Commander: ...

HMG21: ...

Vixen: Beep?

Commander: Bad boy!

Commander: I'm guessing the person who lost the present must be really worried, no? Shall we go return it to that person first?

HMG21: No can do.

HMG21: I can't tell which present was the extra one, and there's no time to have you sift through them, Commander.

HMG21: Also, I have no idea who lost that present...

Commander: (Sighs) It can't be helped, then.

Commander: I guess all we can do is deliver all the other presents first.

Commander: That way, the last one will be the one that Vixen stole.

HMG21: You're right... Tonight, everyone's desire for presents knows no limits.

HMG21: We don't have as much time as you think we do, so let's hurry and move out!

HMG21 suddenly perks herself up with a few slaps on her own cheek, then turns away and leaves.

Commander: Oh...oh! Aren't we motivated now? It's spreading to me too!

Commander: ...But you were the one who called out to me just now, right?

Vixen: Beep!

Springfield: Hm? This present is for me? ...Thank you, Miss HMG21.

HMG21: You-you're welcome. Also, I'm Santa Claus!

Commander: So she WAS up... If I'd known, I would have gone for that cup of coffee.

AA-12: An everlasting lollipop... Thank you, HMG21.

HMG21: No problem! I'm Santa Claus, after all... Although, I have the feeling that there's no point if you keep licking it...

Commander: Hm? Did I get her the wrong thing?

AA-12: No... It's not like that, I like it a lot...

AA-12: In any case... Thank you very much for all your trouble.

AA-12: Ugh... Thanking people in such a serious and proper way... It's just so gross...

HMG21: Are you okay?!

FF FNC: (Snores)

HMG21: I can't believe there are some Dolls who are actually asleep... I thought everyone would be looking forward to it.

Commander: ...It's her, after all. Be careful, don't wake her up.

HMG21: She's sleeping like a corpse. I doubt she'll ever wake up.

Commander: But we're giving her chocolate, right?

HMG21: ...I'll be careful.

Commander: Although I personally bought each of these presents earlier today... I have to say, the amount we have here is kind of scary.

HMG21: We just delivered the last of them... Hardly anyone was asleep.

Commander: Well, everyone was looking forward to getting their presents from Santa Claus.

HMG21: ...At first, I only took the job because I wanted to personally give Big Sis her present.

HMG21: But it seems this job is more meaningful than I first imagined.

Commander: You're happy after receiving everyone's gratitude, right?

HMG21: ...A little.

Commander: In any case, it's almost over... God, I'm so tired.

HMG21: You really are exhausted, Commander.

HMG21: My apologies for making you accompany me for so long.

Commander: Haha, it's alright. I was the one who wanted to come, after all.

Commander: ...Huh? Wasn't that the last present just now?

Commander: Why are there two more presents left?

HMG21: This belongs to Big Sis.

Commander: ...I see, so you saved it for last.

HMG21: Yeah... I was worried that I'd lose my motivation if I gave it too early.

Commander: Certainly not, I'm sure you're not such an irresponsible person, HMG21.

Commander: Shall we give it to Gr G3 first? Or do you want to look for the owner of the missing present?

HMG21: I don't want to visit Big Sis while I'm still thinking of work... But I still don't know who this present belongs to.

HMG21: And Vixen's no help either.

Commander: In that case, let's go over to Gr G3's place first.

Commander: I feel bad about it, but it really is very late.

Commander: We'll just have to find the present's owner tomorrow.

HMG21: Yeah...

We arrive in front of Gr G3's dorm. HMG21 knocks on the door.

Commander: Don't tell me she's asleep...

The sound of stumbling footsteps comes from beyond the door.

Gr G3: Sorry! I was...Commander?

There is a "thud" as Gr G3 opens the door. She looks a little anxious, and she doesn't seem to have gotten a wink of sleep.

The room behind her appears messy too.

Commander: Are you busy?

Gr G3: No, I'm just looking for something... HMG21?

Just as Gr G3 is about to answer, she spots HMG21, who has taken cover behind me.

HMG21: B-Big Sis.

HMG21 calls Vixen to her side somewhat nervously.

HMG21: M-Merry Christmas! This...this is for you!

Gr G3: There it is!

Commander: Huh?

Before HMG21 can finish, Gr G3's face breaks into a delighted smile and she takes the extra present from Vixen.

It's plain to see that HMG21 doesn't know what is going on, and she has a blank look on her face as she holds the gift she is going to give Gr G3.

Commander: ...I see.

Commander: Is this present yours, Gr G3?

Gr G3: Yes, that's right... I've been searching for it all afternoon. Thankfully you brought it back.

Gr G3: ...But why is it with you?

HMG21: Huh...huh...?

Commander: What the heck, we've been running around all day and it turned out like this.

Commander: ...No wonder Vixen was so worked up, was it feeling happy on its owner's behalf?

Commander: ...

Commander: ...In that case, I ought to be heading back.

HMG21: Huh? Commander?

Gr G3: Commander...

Commander: I'm very tired and I want to go back right away to sleep...

Commander: I'll let you sisters take care of the rest between yourselves.

Commander: (Yawns) So tired..

HMG21: Commander...

HMG21: ...Danke.

Commander: Think nothing of it.

The Commander turns and leaves.

Gr G3: HMG21... It's a little late now, but could you please accept this present?

HMG21: Is...is this really for me?

Gr G3: Of course. I prepared it for you.

Gr G3: I thought I'd lost it, I was so scared.

Vixen: Beep—

HMG21: M-me too... Please accept this present!

Gr G3: Merry Christmas, HMG21.

HMG21: Merry Christmas, Big Sis!

...

Both the feeling of wanting to receive presents and wanting to give them are the same for everyone.

Those who are baptized are grateful for their baptism, while the ones who administer it bestow their prayers.

That is the meaning of Christmas.
