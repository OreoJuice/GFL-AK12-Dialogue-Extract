...

In the Griffin dorms.

【Tactical Doll Thunder, you have received a new daily schedule.】

【You are requested to attend the indicated cocktail party tomorrow. Refer to the attachments for the location.】

【Additional requirement: you must be formally dressed.】

Thunder: So it's a new mission...

Thunder: I need to complete it properly.

...A call comes through.

Thunder: (Is this the Commander? Why would the Commander contact me at a time like this...)

Thunder: Good evening, Commander.

Thunder: You ought to be off work. Are you putting in overtime?

Commander: If worrying about how you might misunderstand the invitation counts as overtime, then perhaps it is — the unpaid kind.

Thunder: Am I misunderstanding something? Isn't it work?

Commander: Of course not, it's R&R.

Commander: There'll be several other Dolls going with you, but you don't need to head there together.

Thunder: So we're going to have fun?

Thunder: Not to work, but to relax and have fun...

Thunder: Is this a holiday?

Commander: That's right.

Thunder: In that case, can I bring my friends along?

Commander: As long as they don't have any missions in progress.

Commander: Who do you have in mind?

Thunder: I was thinking of M950A, is she free?

Commander: Let me see...

Commander: Kalin, is M950A free on the day of the party?

Kalin: M950A? What a shame, she happens to be on dispatch that day.

Kalin: The party will be over by the time she gets back...

Thunder: ...You can't change her schedule?

Kalin: That would have to be done beforehand, and she's already set out.

Commander: That's how it is. I'm very sorry, Thunder. Do you have anyone else in mind?

Thunder: No.

Commander: Then go and enjoy yourself as much as you like — that said, you'll need to mind your personal image, as you will be attending as a Griffin representative, after all.

Thunder: ...Understood.

Thunder: I'll be at the party on time and I'll have a dress ready.

Commander: Are you upset because you can't bring a friend along to the party?

Thunder: That's not important.

Thunder: The schedule's been arranged, and I will go.

Commander: I see.

Commander: Then I hope you'll have a good time, Thunder.

The call from the Commander ends.

Thunder lies on her bed and opens a private comms channel, one for only two people.

Thunder: The Commander gave me a mission to attend a cocktail party.

【The user you are hailing — M950A — is currently on a mission. Switching to voicemail mode.】

Thunder: I wish I was going to the party with you.

Thunder stares at the ceiling and quietly waits for a reply.

Ten minutes go by, then twenty...

Yet the comms channel remains silent.

An hour passes.

Thunder closes her eyes.

【You have a new communications request.】

【Connecting.】

M950A: The anniversary party? That's great, too bad I can't go back early. Things here are a little prickly, but I should still be able to come back on time!

M950A: Enjoy the party, chances like these are hard to come by.

Thunder: ...

Thunder: The Commander seems very happy and wants me to enjoy the party as well.

Thunder: But I don't know what I should be doing.

M950A: It's simple. A cocktail party is where you can express yourself, so do whatever you want!

M950A: That's what I did.

Thunder: You've been to one before? But there's nothing I want to do.

M950A: Well, that can't be helped.

M950A: If there's anything you like or want to do that you can't do in the base, just go do it at the cocktail party.

M950A: Besides, nobody's going to mind much at places like that, so just go ahead and express yourself!

Thunder: I understand.

M950A: Crap, more enemies showed up.

M950A: I need to focus on the battle. See ya!

Thunder: Alright.

M950A: Oh yeah, while I might not be able to go out with you, could you tell me about your experience at the party when I get back?

M950A: That way, it'll be like you had gone with me.

【Transmission ends.】

Thunder: Yeah, I will.

【The user you are hailing — M950A — is currently on a mission. Switching to voicemail mode.】

The next evening.

After the party officially begins, even the most elegant and dignified people soon end up talking and laughing loudly in the festive atmosphere.

I had thought that given the mood in the air, finding Thunder would be difficult, but in fact it only takes a minute to track her down.

She is standing by the dessert table, discussing something with a person dressed like a chef.

How surprising. I decide against interrupting the conversation and instead wait until the chef has left.

Commander: Good evening, Thunder.

Thunder: Ah, it's you, Commander.

She is still holding a plate of desserts, and she seems very relaxed as she looks toward me.

However, her face soon reverts back to its usual impassive state, and it makes me wonder if I had imagined the look of childish excitement I just saw.

Commander: You look very beautiful in that dress.

Thunder: Thank you, Commander. You look very presentable as well.

Commander: She replied way too fast, that must have been a pre-programmed response, right?

Commander: Speaking of which, it wouldn't be strange for her to have something like that, given her previous job...

Commander: Are the desserts here good?

Thunder: This one, and this one, and this one...they're all delicious. Would you like to try some, Commander?

Thunder: It's called "Bitter Rock'n'Roll".

Commander: "Bitter Rock'n'Roll"? The chefs here sure give their work some...interesting names.

Thunder: I was the one who suggested it.

Commander: I see...then don't mind if I do.

Commander: ...

Commander: I can't believe how good this is.

Thunder: I think it's quite delicious as well.

Thunder: And this one over here, I'd like to name it "The Third Color Rivaled by None."

Thunder: As for this one, I'd like to call it "Puppy Love". I haven't figured out what to call these two round ones yet...

Commander: They're all interesting names. It looks like you're enjoying yourself, which is a weight off my shoulders.

Thunder: The person who made these came over and spoke to me. He said that they were all experimental works with no names.

Thunder: It would be a shame to let these delicious things go into the belly without a name.

Thunder: Therefore, I wanted to give them names before eating them.

Thunder: That way, when I remember this event, I can call each of them by name.

Commander: ...

Thunder: Commander?

Thunder: Did I say something bad?

Commander: Not at all.

Commander: That gesture of yours is very...romantic. Yes, that's the word for it.

Commander: I recall that M950A also did something very romantic during the anniversary party several years back.

Thunder: What did she do?

Thunder: I'd like to know.

Commander: Hm...

Commander: When the party was nearing its conclusion, she jolted all the drowsy people awake with her vigorous voice.

Commander: "Listen to my song!" she said.

Commander: Back then, the way she stood on stage, shouting with total self-confidence and reigniting the mood...it's as brilliant now when I think about it as it was then.

Thunder: I like her very much.

Commander: She's very likable when she's like that. Just like you.

Thunder: Likable...huh.

Thunder: Are you praising me, or is there some other meaning to it, Commander?

Commander: Of course I'm praising you.

Thunder: Please help yourself.

Saying so, Thunder offers her scarred arm to me.

Commander: ...Huh?

Thunder: I won't cry out in pain, so please do whatever you want.

Commander: I think you've gotten the wrong idea, Thunder.

Commander: That wasn't what I meant.... This is not your previous "workplace"

Commander: I've got a rough idea of what happened in the past, but I won't do things like that.

Thunder looks at me in confusion.

Commander: ...I admit, some humans are scum, the kind who would commit such... abuse against dolls and even their own kind.

Commander: But there's nobody like that in Griffin. You may wear a beautiful dress and taste desserts freely here and do whatever you want on your holidays.

Commander: See, even if you call it "Bitter Rock and Roll", ice cream on coffee is still sweet.

Thunder: I think I know what you're trying to say.

Thunder: You are comforting me.

Thunder: However, there is no need to comfort Dolls.

Commander: I'm telling you the truth, Thunder.

Commander: What you experienced in the past won't happen again in Griffin.

Commander: Even if I order you to do anything...

Thunder: I will obey your orders.

Commander: Then I have only one order for you—

Commander: "Seek your happiness to your heart's content, Thunder."

Thunder: ...I still don't understand why you're doing this.

Thunder: But if it's an order, then I will do my best to complete it.

Commander: If it makes you feel better, then go ahead and do so.

Thunder: Then, may I continue naming the desserts?

Commander: Of course. Like I said before, you can do what you want when you're on holiday.

Commander: Go ahead and do what you'd like.

Thunder: I understand...

Commander: ...Wait a minute, what are you doing, hold on, Thunder! Don't pull out your gun at a party—!!

...

【You have received a communication request from Thunder.】

【Connecting.】

Thunder: I've returned to the base.

M950A: Sorry, I'm not back yet.

M950A: Did you enjoy the party?

Thunder: Very much.

Thunder: The party was lively and safe, and I got to do what I wanted.

M950A: Sounds good. What did you do?

Thunder: I gave many desserts names, and I met a skilled chef.

Thunder: There were many humans and Dolls at the party. There was one who was a little like me...she was in a black and burgundy dress and she was very pretty, but I didn't know her.

M950A: Then things went well, didn't they?

M950A: Oh yes, are you back in the dorm now?

Thunder: Not yet. The chef gave me a present. He said it was to thank me for naming his desserts.

Thunder: Since it's not good to eat desserts in the dorm, I'll be waiting for you in the café.

Thunder: The Commander said I could do whatever I wanted on my holidays. Since I'm still on holiday, I want you to try them too.

Thunder: They're sweet and delicious, like a bullet through the neural cloud.

The user you are hailing — M950A — is currently on a mission. Switching to voicemail mode.】

Thunder: ...

The door to the café suddenly flies open.

A familiar figure stands in the doorway in front of Thunder. She looks a little wind-blown and dusty, but her expression looks to be quite pleased.

M950A: I'm back.

Thunder: ...Welcome back.

M950A: Let me see... Is this the box?

M950A: I can't wait to see just how delicious the desserts you named are going to be.

M950A: I'll be opening it, okay?

M950A: ...Thunder?

Thunder: ...

M950A: ...Wait a minute, Thunder! Don't shoot in the café!

That night, the gunshots that suddenly rang through the base sparked a mild panic.

However, I could not rebuke Thunder, who had used her wages to pay for the repairs.

After all, given that she was filling in the payment slips with a smile on her face, she must have had a good time.
