...

M4A1: ...

After putting on the ivy-shaped garter, M4 stands before the mirror and studies herself from head to toe.

M4A1: Hm!

M4A1: Perfect.

M4A1: (Do your best, M4!)

M4A1: (...You've got this!)

She gives herself a pep talk as if she's about to enter the battlefield.

Her gaze then falls onto the table next to the mirror, where a photograph stands. In the photo are four distinctive girls, including M4's bashful figure...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...I wish we could get a complete group photo.

...

M16A1: Oooh, this is excellent whiskey!

M16 drains her glass in one go and exhales in satisfaction.

M4A1: The ball hasn't even started yet. Don't drink it all up.

M16A1: I consider the party started the moment I got my hands on booze.

M16A1: But I thought the venue has its own beverage provider, so where did this whiskey come from?

M4A1: You seem to like it.

M16A1: Hm?

M4A1: Ahem! Right, why don't you head over to the stage during the intermission?

M16A1: What, are you going to perform?

M4A1: Uh, that's not it.

M16A1: Pity. I thought you had all kinds of surprises for me.

M4A1: More importantly, I really want all of us to get a pho...

M16A1: Pho?

M4A1: Uh, n-nothing!

M16A1: Hm?

OTs-14: M16.

The conversation is interrupted by Groza's sudden appearance. After exchanging a few words with her, M16's face darkens.

M16A1: Then let's set off.

M4A1: M16?

M4A1: Is it an enemy attack?

M16A1: Enemy attack? No, someone's just planning to down all the booze prepared for the banquet; I have to go and save it.

M4A1: But weren't you just...

M16A1: We'll continue when I'm back. Go and have some fun with SOP-II and the others.

M16 throws back the second glass of whiskey.

And thanks for this, M4.

She puts down the glass and heads off with Groza.

M4A1: ...

Looking at the empty whiskey glass, M4 can't help but feel just a little bit pleased.

M4A1: So she knew all along. I got this whiskey just for her.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: But...where's SOP-II?

M4A1: She should've already got here...

M4 looks around but finds no sign of SOP-II.

M4A1: (We agreed to attend the banquet together. It shouldn't have taken her too long to get dressed.)

M4A1: ...

M4A1: (Guess I'll just take a walk around.)

M4A1: So this is the stage?

As she strolls around casually while also being on the lookout for SOP-II, M4 notices that a stage has just been set up on one end of the venue.

She sees a group of Dolls rehearsing their dance steps before the ball begins.

M4A1: And this is where they rehearse for the performances.

M4A1: ...Performances, huh.

As she watches the flitting figures on the stage, they gradually morph into her close friends in her head.

The steady rhythm lulls her consciousness into a stupor...

RO635: But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?

RO635: It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun!

M4A1: Huh?!

RO635: She speaks.

RO635: O, speak again, bright angel!

M4A1: Wait, RO, what are you doing?

M4 SOPMOD II: Cut! Cut!

M4 SOPMOD II: M4, say your lines!

M4A1: You too, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: Call me Director SOP-II!

M4A1: So we've also put together a show?

M4A1: Come to think of it, those lines sounded like...?

ST AR-15: "Romeo and Juliet", and you've been cast as Juliet.

M4A1: H-Have I?

RO635: Pull yourself together, M4. It took me a lot of work to get over my stage fright...

M4A1: O-Okay!

M4A1: ...Uh...

M16A1: You haven't even learned your lines? Sheesh... Here, repeat after me.

M16A1: "'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."

Director SOP-II: Wow, you sound exactly like a besotted young girl.

M16A1: Any problem with my acting?

Director SOP-II: Oh, ahem!

Director SOP-II: Go on then, M4!

Um...

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a...a...

RO635: Montague!

M4A1: Oh. Thou art thyself, though not a mounted goo!

...

From what M4 knows, this kind of silence would usually be described as "awkward".

M16A1: PUAHAHAHAHAHA! What the heck does this have to do with goo?!

M4A1: Huh?

RO635: ...Pffft, looks like you need more time to memorize your lines.

ST AR-15: Humph, that's just like you, M4.

M4A1: Well... Haha, hahahaha...

Director SOP-II: Hey, focus! This is serious!

SOP-II rolls up her script and taps it against her palm, but she is unable to put a stop to the bubbling mirth.

This scene is captured by the click of a camera, preserved forever as a beautiful memory...

M4A1: The flash was pretty dazzling...

M4 raises a hand to shield her eyes from the brightness.

M4A1: With the curtains now closed on the little imaginary scene in her head, M4 finally realizes that the white glare is actually from the overhead spotlights.

M4A1: The Dolls have already finished their rehearsal.

M4A1: I wonder what the photo would have looked like...

M4A1: But why would there be a play in the first place... Hahaha.

M4A1: ...Huh?

When she glances at the stage again, she finds a few familiar Dolls standing on it.

M4A1: R-RO?

M4A1: AR-15?!

RO635: Oh, M4!

The moment their eyes meet, M4 flinches inwardly as she almost superimposes her own fantasy onto the Dolls standing on the stage.

She tries to shake it off and waves at RO before joining them.

M4A1: Hm...

ST AR-15: Why are you looking all jittery?

M4A1: J-Jittery?!

KSVK: Please try to relax. It's not good if you look tense or embarrassed at such an important moment.

M4A1: Are you about to take a picture?

RO635: Of course. We were just waiting for you to for the group photo.

M4A1: Group photo? Did you...?!

ST AR-15: Yep. Also...

ST AR-15: "I won't be gone for long, make sure you save me a good spot!"

ST AR-15: That's what M16 said.

M4A1: S-So you saw right through me...?

RO635: Well, you can never keep a secret.

M4A1: Uh, I'll do my best to correct that in the future.

ST AR-15: Can't you spend your effort on more important things?

M4A1: Huh?! I-I don't...!

RO635: Pffft!

RO635: Oh, it's almost time.

ST AR-15: That damned 16. She said it wouldn't take long, but there's still no sign of her. And where the hell is SOP-II?

RO635: Let's give them a few more minutes. We can snap a few photos first just to see how they turn out, so that the actual group photo will work out well for sure once everyone is here.

RO635: What do you think, M4?

M16A1: I heard AR-15 griping about me just as I finished talking with Groza.

M16A1: Haha, I got here right on time.

M4A1: Yeah! Then KSVK, if you'd please!

KSVK: No problem. Please stand together.

The Dolls stand at the spots allotted by KSVK.

M4 imagines how the new group photo will turn out, and her face breaks into a happy smile.

KSVK presses down on the shutter button at that wonderful moment.
