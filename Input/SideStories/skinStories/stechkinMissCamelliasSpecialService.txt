In a corner inside a certain café in a human city.

Stechkin: Uh... Err... Um...

Commander: What is it? It's not like you to be so hesitant.

Stechkin: Well... I mean... Haha...

Commander: It certainly wasn't easy to arrange for this meeting. So? Spit it out.

Commander: After all, I did pay an extra "meeting fee", isn't that right, Miss "Camellia"?

Stechkin: Alright, alright! Stop calling me that! Fine...I'll tell you, okay?!

...

Several days ago.

At the Griffin base, Stechkin kept refreshing the terminal.

Stechkin: It's already 6pm, and the Valentine's Day party starts at 8, but I still haven't received the invitation...

Stechkin: Is there a bug in the system?

An incoming transmission request.

Stechkin: Oh, here it is! Ahem, hm...

Stechkin: Hello? What's up?

M950A: Stechkin, if you're free tonight, can you do me a favor?

Stechkin: Oh I see, you haven't finished setting up the party venue, have you?

M950A: Huh? Nope, that's all done ages ago.

M950A: So are you free tonight? I mean, do you mind if we swap shifts?

Stechkin: I AM free, but what exactly am I going to get out of this arrangement~?

M950A: I will pay you Griffin's standard overtime bonus. Is that okay with you?

Stechkin: The bonus is calculated according to my current salary. That means you'll have to pay me DOUBLE the hourly rate.

M950A: Oh, sure. So you agreed, yeah? Then I'll file for the swap.

Stechkin: Of course. If there's money to be made, I'll make it.

Stechkin: ...What are you doing tonight? What's so important you're skipping work for it?

M950A: The Valentine's Day party is tonight, haven't you heard? I got an invitation, and it'd be a shame if I didn't go.

M950A: You're not going?

Stechkin: ...

Stechkin: I'm not interested in those kinds of stupid parties. It's not profitable, and I'd even have to spend money on buying something to wear. Anyone who wants to go can be my guest, but I'll pass.

M950A: Hm... I suppose it's up to you. That's it then. Please cover my shift tonight at the surveillance room.

Transmission over.

Stechkin: ...

Stechkin: ...What the hell? How dare they not invite me?! I've even prepared a new dress just to be the diva of the party!

Stechkin: How can they not invite a smart and cute Doll like me...? Never mind, I'm just gonna earn that overtime pay for now.

An hour later, Stechkin was on the way to work. As she listened to the passing Dolls' joyful chatter, she gritted her teeth and clenched her fists.

???: Oh my, if it isn't Stechkin! You don't seem to be in a very good mood.

Stechkin: ...

Stechkin: It's you, RMB-93. Why aren't you dressed up? Are you not attending the party?

Stechkin: Ohhhhh I know – you've also got work tonight, don't you?

RMB-93: That's right, I'm in charge of security outside the party venue.

RMB-93: Listening to the Commander chattering so happily with the Dolls who aren't at work tonight is really—

RMB-93: Oh? You're making an interesting face, Stechkin.

Stechkin: Yours isn't much better. What if I give you an extra commission on top of the security work? Would you be interested?

RMB-93: That depends on what kind of commission we're talking about.

Stechkin: It's pretty simple, really. I want you to...

Commander: So you hired RMB-93 to film a video of M950A while she was completely sloshed?

Stechkin: It wasn't against the rules at Griffin. It would be a waste of a good opportunity if I hadn't done it.

Commander: You have backup copies, don't you.

Stechkin: Nope, Grizzly bought the mother tape; everyone knows that.

Commander: Give me the copies.

Stechkin: I really don't have them! C'mon, you don't believe me?

Commander: RMB-93 recently received a bank transfer. You'd never make a bad bargain.

Stechkin: Urk! This will turn into a bad bargain if I hand them over! I'm not giving them to you!

Commander: ...Sheesh, what am I to do with you. I'll pay for them, but you must hand over ALL existing copies, including the ones in RMB-93's possession.

Stechkin: Alright, I get it... You know, girls would hate you if you're always so uptight.

Commander: Just carry on.

In the surveillance room while the Valentine's Day party was in full swing, Stechkin sat in front of the control panel that said "MAINTENANCE IN PROGRESS" on the monitor and scrolled through Grifchan in boredom.

Stechkin: "How to deal with my roommate, who would randomly turn into a large white mink." ...BOOOORING.

Stechkin: "Legitimate reasons to receive equestrian training at the base." ...You can tell who wrote that just from the title!

Stechkin: And this, "How to be sure you'll always win in a poker game?" Really? Just cheat, duh!

Stechkin: Gosh, all these idiots.

System: Maintenance complete. Rebooting system...

Stechkin: Aha, here it comes! The surveillance system is back online, now I can see who's messing around at such a time.

Stechkin: Library... Training ground... Tsk, they're all pretty empty.

Stechkin: Hold on, what was that?!

Something "unusual" was captured in the footage. Stechkin immediately rewound the timeline.

Stechkin: Strange, was it just a trick of the eye...? Oh, that's it! There it was!

Stechkin: That shadow inside the Commander's window... That couldn't be the Commander!

Stechkin: Someone was in the Commander's room at such an hour... Heheh. As if I could pass up this opportunity!

Commander: So that was your reason for uploading the video onto Grifchan anonymously and even sending a notification to all the Griffin Dolls?

Stechkin: Hey, the notification wasn't my doing! That's just Grifchan's algorithm! If a thread gets a lot of clicks within a short period of time, it automatically sends out a notif, so how was that my fault?!

Commander: But you're still the one who started it... Whatever, I'll let that pass.

Commander: So what happened afterwards was basically what we went through together, right?

Commander: I saw you in the wedding dress the moment I came through the door.

Stechkin: Humph, Makarov put one over on me, but I looked great in it, didn't I?

Commander: You did.

...Two days ago.

Carcano M1891: Alright! Since it's all water under the bridge, let's start preparing for the remedial event!

Makarov: What do you mean, "it's all water under the bridge"...? Don't go misusing idioms.

Makarov: And what's the deal with this "remedial event"? I'm just a detective, so why do I have to get involved?

Carcano M1891: Because this is a historic moment that you must bear witness to.

Carcano M1891: This remedial event is called "Operation Matchmaking for the Commander"!

Zas M21: ...I'd like to leave right now.

Carcano M1891: Not a chance! C'mon, Zas! Please be the first to pick your wedding dress!

Makarov: Why are there so many wedding dresses anyway?

Zas M21: Apparently, Gr G36c and some of the others went on a mission before and ran into some kind of ghost. They came back with a huge collection of wedding dresses as their spoils... Wait, so these are the spoils?

Carcano M1891: It'd be a complete waste if these gorgeous pieces are never worn.

Carcano M1891: Someone HAS to show off their beauty! Go on then, pretty ladies, take your pick! If it doesn't fit you well, I can make alterations on the spot!

Makarov: You have a point, but I don't want to.

Carcano M1891: Aw c'mon! You deserve this as a reward for your great service!

Carcano M1891: Zas, don't run! You'll get your fair share too!

Zas M21: Why? Wait, Cano, don't push me into the dresses!

Carcano M1891: If you don't pick one, I'll do it for you! I already have something in mind that'll suit you perfectly. You'll look drop dead gorgeous in this.

Zas M21: You're not listening, are you...?

Zas M21: Fine, I suppose it doesn't hurt to take part in such tomfoolery every now and then.

Makarov: I'll have no part in this.

Stechkin: So does that mean I can pick one too?

Carcano M1891: Would you like to? Go right ahead!

Stechkin: Hm... Let me see.

Stechkin: I'll try this.

Carcano M1891: Oh, you've got great taste! A style that's both cute and bold. But since this is more like a coat dress, you'll need something to go inside.

Stechkin: Then I'll take it back to my dorm and find something to...

Makarov: Stop right there.

Stechkin: Huh?

Stechkin felt a firm grip on her sleeve. She turned around and was met with Makarov's incredulous gaze.

Makarov: What are you planning to do with the dress?

Stechkin: What do you mean? Weren't you paying attention?

Stechkin: I'm going to try it on, duh.

Makarov: Oh? You can do that right here; why are you taking it away?

Stechkin: I need to find something to go under the dress! Listen to what Cano said, Makarov.

Makarov: Cano has something that'll work and she's gone to fetch it for you.

Makarov: Or do you have something else in mind?

Stechkin: I have no idea what you're talking about!

Carcano M1891: Aha, got it! This black skin-tight bodysuit would look great under the dress. Come and try it on, Stechkin!

Makarov: See? It's all sorted out, so just put on the dress right here.

Stechkin: ...

Carcano M1891: What is it?

Carcano M1891: Is something wrong with the bodysuit?

Stechkin: No way! It feels so soft and smooth, it must be very expensive! I like it – I'll put it on right now.

Watching as Stechkin makes a hasty retreat, Cano turns toward Makarov in confusion.

Makarov: Don't worry about it. Just prevented a little rat from making off with some cheese.

Makarov: It's about time the Commander showed up, right? How did you spin this to the Commander?

Carcano M1891: I told the Commander there'd be a wedding dress photoshoot later and invited them along to look at the dresses.

Makarov: Will there be a photoshoot?

Carcano M1891: There will if we want there to be! I've even invited Gr G36c and Desert Eagle to be the coaches.

Makarov: Desert Eagle makes sense, but are you sure Gr G36c won't turn this into some kind of "3021: A Space Wedding"?

Carcano M1891: She might, but there's nothing wrong with that, don't you think?

Carcano M1891: Ah, Stechkin is done!

That was the first thing I heard when I arrived at the venue.

Stechkin's Voice: I've just got to hand it to me. I picked the perfect dress for myself.

Stechkin's Voice: Are you ready, guys?!

Carcano M1891: Ooooh! Let us behold your radiant figure, Signorina Stechkin!

Stechkin: That's exactly what I'm going to do!

Cano clapped very indulgently. Makarov shot me a glance and joined in on the applause.

Stechkin: Well, Commander? Don't I look good?

She raised her skirts and gave me a twirl, and a shower of petals danced in a flurry along with her flowing dress.

Commander: You look lovely.

Carcano M1891: Fantastic! You've chosen a dress that suits you perfectly!

Makarov: Hm, not bad.

Makarov: Now then... Commander, tell us about what happened last night in greater detail.

Commander: ...What?

I stop replaying the events of that day in my mind and set my eyes once again on Stechkin, who's sitting across the table in front of me at the moment.

Commander: But Makarov dragged me away before I could get a good look at you...

Stechkin: See? Makarov never knows when to give up, does she?

Stechkin: She obsesses over the weirdest things. So what if a girl was in your room in the middle of the night? That's hardly surprising for someone like you!

Commander: Hey, that came out wrong.

Commander: And don't try to change the subject. Where is the item, Miss Camellia?

Stechkin: I told you to stop calling me by that embarrassing name! That's just a sock puppet... For goodness' sake.

Stechkin: You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?!

Commander: Well, I didn't expect I'd catch you red-handed on that reseller website.

Stechkin: It's been given to me... Isn't it my business what I do with it?

Stechkin: I wore the dress, and the photo shoot was done, so now it's just sitting there, collecting dust.

Commander: But you look good in it, don't you?

Stechkin: It's not like I can wear it all the time. If I fought in that white dress, I'd just make myself the perfect target for the enemy.

Stechkin: Since it's just taking up space, I might as well sell it in exchange for some credits. If anything goes wrong, at least I'll still be able to manage for a while.

Commander: You seem very concerned about your future.

Stechkin: That's only natural, right?! Who can NOT be concerned after waking up with a chunk of missing memory?

Stechkin: Imagine – one second you're still preparing for battle on the train, then the next second, you wake up in a Griffin repair bay, and everyone tells you that the battle is over... Wouldn't you also find that disturbing?

Commander: ...

Stechkin: So it's only right that I do what I can to prepare for the future.

Commander: Still, if you're that worried, you can simply resign right now... Or even run away the next time you find yourself in danger.

Stechkin: My primary command is to protect you, so I can't really do that.

Stechkin: No matter how money-minded I am, your safety still comes first.

Commander: ...You told me as much just before you went down in battle.

Stechkin: Sorry? What did you just say?

Commander: Nothing. I was just thinking... If that's true, then what's the point in hoarding your wealth?

Commander: If you end up getting completely destroyed...

Stechkin: ...

Stechkin: Crap, you cornered me into a logical fallacy – my neural cloud is crashing!

Stechkin: Just kidding. Well, you just see through everything, don't you? None of my excuses would work on you...

Commander: So have you brought the wedding dress?

Stechkin: No way... Are you really seizing it?!

Stechkin: I won't let you! It's my personal property!

Commander: Cano holds no ownership over these wedding dresses. Griffin is the official donee.

Stechkin: Ack... But even so, it now belongs to me.

Commander: I don't plan on taking it by force.

Commander: But you love that dress, don't you?

Stechkin: I do. It's really pretty, and I got a lot of compliments for it...

Commander: Won't you consider keeping it?

Stechkin: ...Beautiful memories don't last, but wealth is a different story.

Stechkin: I've worn it, I've had my moment, and that's enough.

Commander: What if I say it's NOT enough?

Stechkin: Not enough?

Commander: I'm offering to buy the wedding dress at the listed price, but the dress will belong to me. If you want to get the sum, you'll have to wear the dress for me on your days off.

Stechkin: ...What?

Commander: You really do look great in the dress. I want to see you in it more often.

Stechkin: Uh... Why are you so...forthright all of a sudden?!

Stechkin: Gosh, of course...of course I look great in that dress!

Commander: So do we have a deal?

Stechkin: I can make a profit AND wear the pretty dress? We have a deal!

Stechkin: But don't you dare change your mind!

Commander: I won't. How about you put it on right now?

After a while, I can hear footsteps coming from behind. Is it her? I wonder as I turn around.

Stechkin: ...Huh, you heard me. Well? What do you think?

Commander: Yep, you do look beautiful in it.

Stechkin: Humph... It's a bit of a pain to let so many people see me like this for free, but I'm enjoying the compliments.

Stechkin: Now...close your eyes.

Commander: You're not going to run away, are you?

Stechkin: As if I would! How hurtful. I haven't even received the payment, there's no way I'd run off just like that.

Stechkin: So why don't you just close your eyes?

I do as she says and close my eyes – everything goes dark.

Something closes in on me, then I feel something warm and soft on my cheek.

"Smooch."

Stechkin: A special gift that comes with your purchase.

Stechkin: Thank you, Commander...

Stechkin: From now on, I'll always be by your side. Both on and off the battlefield... Here's to our shared future together.
