...

...In the command room.

Kalin: Commander, here is the confirmed roster of the investigation team.

Kalin: You've really got yourself a huge assignment this time – no mermaids have been sighted in almost half a century.

Kalin: And the latest sighting just so happened to be near the sector under your jurisdiction.

Commander: Yeah, it's a perfect chance for us to investigate.

Kalin: "Perfect", huh.

Commander: Get everyone here for the briefing.

Kalin: Alright, I'll summon them now.

I'm in luck! I got picked!!

I knew the Goddess of Luck wouldn't desert me!

A Doll is muttering to herself in the corner of the command room.

R93: Heeheehee... Looks like even I have my moments of good fortune.

Lewis: Um...hi!

R93: Maybe I should gamble a bit while this streak of good luck is still with me... In my purse, I still have 1...2...3...

Lewis: ...Hello!

Lewis: Do you hear me...?

R93: Oh!

R93: You're...Lewis, right?

Lewis: That's right, I'm Lewis...

Lewis: We'll be on the same team for this operation.

R93: So you're going to be my teammate! Nice to meet you!

Lewis: Likewise.

R93: Yay!

R93: Such a pretty girl! I'm drowning in good fortune today!

R93: (Wait...maybe I'm way too lucky?)

R93: ...

R93: (No, the more I think about it, the more fishy this feels... This isn't a dream, is it?)

R93: (...I had a nightmare about failing my neural upgrade not too long ago.)

Lewis: W...what's the matter?

Lewis: R93?

R93: Lewis, please hit me!

Lewis: ...Pardon?

R93: I'll explain later. Just hit me.

Lewis: Then...don't blame me afterwards.

R93: Uh, you don't have to hit me too hard either...

Lewis punches R93 in the abdomen, and R93 passes out immediately.

...In the Griffin dorms.

Hugging her belly, R93 slowly sits up in bed.

R93: It hurts...so this really isn't a dream...

Lewis: Sorry, I don't really know how to control my strength.

R93 gives Lewis a nonchalant wave, indicating that she's fine.

Lewis: Why did you think you're dreaming? Being chosen to be part of the investigation isn't that big of a deal...

R93: That's because...my luck has always been rotten. It feels really odd how things have been going so smoothly today.

Lewis: You don't have to worry too much. There's this law, right? I believe it's called the law of conservation of luck?

R93: The law of conservation of luck? I don't believe in such a thing!

R93: Lewis, do you know about Helian?

Lewis: Yeah...what about her?

R93: Let me tell you a secret. Come closer.

Lewis: ...

Lewis: ......!

Lewis: She's failed so many times?!

R93: If the law of conservation of luck was valid...she'd have met a good guy long ago.

Lewis: You know how they say it all comes down to luck and physical appeal in terms of love. With luck, you will run into the right person; with physical appeal, this person will be attracted enough to find out more about your personality...

R93: Wait! Hold it, hold it.

R93: Let's end the discussion right there. I have a feeling we shouldn't say any more on the subject.

Lewis: Yeah, I suppose that's enough chit-chat.

Lewis: I'm going to change into my battle gear. I'll see you later at the beach!

R93: Sure, see ya!

...An hour later, R93 arrives at the location where the mermaid sighting was reported.

R93: Lewis isn't here yet... Guess I'll wait for a bit.

15 minutes later...

R93: If Lewis doesn't show up soon, I'll have to execute Plan B...

Another 15 minutes passed...

R93 fishes out a coin from her storage case and tosses it into the air.

R93: I'll let the Goddess of Luck decide. Heads, I keep waiting for Lewis; tails...I initiate Plan B and carry out the mission on my own!

The coin's spin starts slowing down.

Suddenly, a strong gust blows it into the ocean.

R93: ...That...doesn't bode too well.

R93: Though it may be the Goddess' intention.

R93: Now that I've been chosen by the Commander, I must repay the favor by returning with outstanding results.

With a splash of glittering water, R93 dives into the sea without even shutting her case.

R93: R93 – commencing operation.

After searching along the coasts for two hours...

R93: ...Nothing.

R93: Do mermaids actually exist?

R93: There have been sighting reports for centuries, but no one has left behind any conclusive photographic evidence.

All of a sudden, a glowing object drifts past R93.

She snatches it out of the water with great agility.

R93: This is...

R93: A round object with the Griffin insignia. It's reflecting the brilliant sunlight...

R93: ...This must be one of those tokens that the Commander is always obsessed about. I'd better hand it over.

Suddenly, another glimmering object drifts past R93. She catches it as well.

R93: A purple triangular disk? Could be a Doll's memory fragment. Guess I'll give this to the Commander too.

R93 has just put the fragment into her case when she plucks out another silvery item from the water.

R93: ...!!

R93: Oh my gosh, it's a brand new, unused Oath ring!

R93: ...More and more shiny objects come drifting towards me. Looks like my treasure hunt is just starting.

After a while, R93 prepares to return to shore with a case full of loot.

R93: Can't believe I found so many valuables. My good fortune today might beat the Goddess of Luck herself.

R93: But...I still haven't gathered any intelligence on the mermaid. Is it really okay if I just go back empty-handed?

R93 tilts her head in deliberation...

R93: I can't go back just yet. I haven't completed my mission...

R93: I can't betray the Commander's trust in me. I'd better keep—

R93: Huh, what's that buoy...? Whoaaa!

The rescue team from not far away hears R93's scream.

QJY-88: Did you hear that, Serdyukov?

Serdyukov: Hear what?

QJY-88: I think someone's shouting for help over there...

Serdyukov: A scream coming from 10 o'clock. It sounds like...R93.

Serdyukov: QJY-88, R93 might be in trouble, we'd better hurry—

Serdyukov: Wait, QJY-88, don't just rush out by yourself!

(Forgive me, Serdyukov. I want to change...because...)

(I...I'm always making trouble for everyone...but no one ever blames me...)

(So this time, let me do something...)

QJY-88: I'm going to save her with my anti-drowning device!

QJY-88's half-rim glasses flash under the bright sun.

She seems to have found her sense of direction.

Serdyukov: -88 is on fire! Looks like my work here is done.

Serdyukov: ...ADS, I made a nice friend today.

Two hours later.

Serdyukov: QJY-88! QJY-88!

QJY-88: Cough...cough...

QJY-88: ...Ser...dyukov.

Serdyukov: Don't push yourself to talk.

QJY-88: But...R93...

Serdyukov: Calm down. I've already notified the Commander.

Serdyukov: Let's make our full report later.

...When they finally find the Commander, the rescue team members both lower their heads in shame.

Serdyukov: ...That's all for our report.

QJY-88: I'm sorry...Commander... It was all my...

Serdyukov: No, I didn't do my duty to protect everyone.

...

It wasn't either of your fault... I'll try to think of something.

Serdyukov: Dammit!

Serdyukov: I didn't expect interference to our comms.

Commander: (We haven't been able to contact R93 ever since she went into the water. Could it be...)

Commander: There might be a possibility of a Sangvis invasion...

At the sound of the word "Sangvis", QJY-88 and Serdyukov look up with widened eyes at the same time.

It's just a possibility... But don't worry, I'll provide all the support I can.

You're dismissed for now. Let me handle this.

...

The two Dolls turn to leave. Their footsteps gradually fade into the distance, where the sun is about to sink beneath the horizon.

Just as the Commander is also about to take off, Lewis suddenly runs over and carefully reveals an object from behind her back.

Lewis: Commander! I don't have any news regarding R93, but I've made a huge discovery!

Lewis: Please look...!

The Commander takes a good look at this "huge discovery".

Commander: This is...

Lewis: I fished this up from the sea. Doesn't it look like a mermaid top?

Lewis: R93 must've been captured by a mermaid!

Commander: ...

Commander: I see.

The Commander then walks along the beach for a while.

According to Lewis' report, it should be around here.

The Commander finally stops and shouts toward the ocean.

R93! R93⁠—

As expected, there is no answer.

But the Commander sees a figure appear behind a large reef.

Looks like I was right.

Then the Commander places the bag given by Lewis on the coast near the reef.

R93, I've put your top here!

The Commander shouts toward the sea again.

Then a tiny, tiny voice comes through the comms.

R93: ...Cough.

I knew you didn't go missing.

R93: Sorry, Commander... I turned off my comms without permission.

It's alright. I can guess why you did that.

You weren't actually in any trouble... You only screamed because your bikini top got snatched away.

R93: I knew you'd understand, Commander.

R93: ...Ugh... I I-I can't believe I made such a stupid mistake during the operation. How could I let my top slip off because of a fishing hook?

It's okay now.

You must've been terrified.

R93: ...

After a short while...

R93, now with her "mermaid top" back on, walks out from behind the reef.

But her head hangs dejectedly and she won't look up from her feet, sinking in the sand.

R93: I'm sorry, Commander... I didn't complete the mission.

R93: I even lost all the bounties that I found... Ahaha, looks like I've got really bad luck today.

(R93...)

The Commander gazes into the distance while thinking of a way to cheer her up.

Commander: (Ah, got it.)

Commander: R93, how about a bet?

R93: Huh?

R93: ...On what?

Commander: Let's bet if a mermaid will actually appear here.

R93: ...You still haven't given up, Commander?

R93: Mermaids aren't real...

R93: And even if they are...a clumsy Doll like me won't be of any help...

Commander: What are you talking about? I know how you truly feel.

Commander: You only kept on searching for so long because you haven't given up.

Commander: I saw the records. You hadn't reported back for a long time – you must've been looking for clues.

R93: ...

R93: You saw right through me. Indeed, I only stayed for so long because I wanted to gather intelligence on the mermaid...

R93: Still...as you can see, I'm not at all outstanding.

R93: My luck might've occasionally made me useful on the battlefield, but I ended up slowing you down on this mission.

Commander: No, R93.

Commander: Luck isn't something so objective.

Commander: To me, I count myself lucky being able to go on a vacation with a lucky star like you.

R93: C-Commander...what are you talking about...

R93: How can someone like me be a lucky star...?

R93: A-and what's the deal with this v-vacation?

Commander: I'll tell you what this is all about.

Commander: All of you have been fighting tough battle after tough battle for a long time.

Commander: So I've been trying to find a chance for you to relax.

Commander: Then I just so happened to have received a commission to investigate a mermaid sighting in the area, so I brought you girls here.

R93: Oh, and there "just so happened" to have been a mermaid sighting...?

Commander: That hardly matters anymore.

Commander: I just want to make a bet with you, R93.

Commander: Because I'll bring you all here some other time and keep looking for the mermaid.

R93: ...Are you serious, Commander?

Commander: Of course.

The girl inhales deeply.

R93: Fine, I can't possibly pass up a wager so heavily tilted in my favor.

A light sea breeze blows as the Commander and R93 exchange a smile. They then start walking back shoulder-to-shoulder.

(I don't know...where our fate will take us.)

(But I won't let some random goddess play dice with our destiny...)

(I'm going to take the dice in my own hands with this lucky star next to me...and roll boxcars.)
