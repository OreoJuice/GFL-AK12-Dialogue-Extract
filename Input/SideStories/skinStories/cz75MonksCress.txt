At the Griffin base, during the changing of shifts.

Spitfire: Sure thing, 75.

CZ75: Huh? Are you really okay with it?

CZ75: I feel bad just asking this of you.

Spitfire: We're just swapping shifts. It's no big deal.

Spitfire: After all, I didn't prepare any new clothes for Lunar New Year...

Spitfire: Have fun making your New Year visits, and don't forget to take some pictures.

CZ75: Then I'll leave this to you, Spitfire!

CZ75: I'll tell you all about it when I'm back!

CZ75 waves happily at Spitfire and dashes off.

CZ75: Thank goodness Spitfire agreed to help me out, or all the careful preparations I've made for the New Year visits would have gone to waste...

CZ75: Let me take a rest back in the dorm, get changed, then gather everyone who's ready—

In CZ75's room at the Griffin dormitories.

CZ75: ...What?! Why would it be you?!

NZ75: What are you talking about, CZ75? Didn't you have a night shift today? Of course I'll be leading the group.

NZ75: Wait, why are you here now?

NZ75: Don't tell me you're ditching work!

CZ75: I just swapped shifts with someone else!

CZ75: And didn't we agree that I'll be leading the group?!

NZ75: Why are you so inflexible? Since you had a shift, of course there had to be a change of plans.

NZ75: Now that everything's settled, you just have to deal with it!

CZ75: As if I'd give in so easily to a rip-off of myself!

NZ75: Can we stop with this kind of unconstructive argument? Even if I'm your copy, I'm still a proper leader here!

CZ75: ...

CZ75: You're right, there's no point in having this kind of pointless argument.

NZ75: How unusual for you to yield.

NZ75: In that case, just...

CZ75: But I don't plan on giving in so easily.

CZ75: Let's have a duel, NZ75. We'll settle the issue on who will lead the New Year visits that way.

NZ75: Ha...

NZ75: Say, have you been hanging around SAA a bit too much lately?

CZ75: As if I'd associate myself with a frivolous soda addict like her!

CZ75: What, too scared to accept the challenge?

NZ75: You think I'm scared?! I've wanted to settle the score with you for a long time, CZ75... Then let's find out which of us is superior today!

NZ75: The leader position may have been decided, but it's not set in stone! If you beat me, I'll tell the others you'll be leading the procession tonight!

CZ75: So you're not a complete wuss.

CZ75: Then we have an agreement. I'll be seeing you at 2000 at the base entrance.

NZ75: In the courtyard? Phew...

NZ75: Alright, 8pm it is.

NZ75: If you're so eager to humiliate yourself in public, I'll humor you.

NZ75: NZ75 ends the call.

NZ75: CZ75 glares at her new outfit hanging in her wardrobe and clenches her fist.

NZ75: I'll show you, NZ75... that there's the reason why I'm the original, and more outstanding than you'll ever be!

Later, at the main entrance of the Griffin base.

CZ75: You showed up on time and didn't run away... Not bad, NZ75.

NZ75: I won't back down, CZ75. I'll show you I'm the stronger one!

NZ75: So how are we going to do this?

CZ75: I intend to beat you fair and square so I won't exploit your weaknesses.

CZ75: Let's do the thing that you performed for the Commander last Spring Festival.

CZ75: W-What? You—

CZ75: You're quite proud of your great sense of balance and coordination, aren't you?

CZ75: Then that's where I'll beat you head-on and win back what I deserve!

Type 97: Things are looking lively here. What's going on?

Type 97: Can I join in?

NZ75: Hmph... I suppose you're not deliberately trying to embarrass me... Fine, I accept.

NZ75: And you arrived at the perfect time, Type 97.

NZ75: CZ75 and I are about to have a duel. Mind being the referee for us?

Type 95: Don't stick your nose into things that don't concern you, 97.

Type 97: But this sounds fun, doesn't it? We've still got some time till we have to meet up with CZ52 anyway. Why not give them a hand?

Type 97: I wanna try posing as a pheasant standing on one leg too, and I don't mind being the referee! Then let's begin in five, four—

Type 95: Oh dear... alright. I'll wait for you.

Type 97: Three, two, one! GAME START!

30 minutes later.

Type 95: We still don't have a winner, 97?

Type 97: My leg is getting sore... Standing on one leg isn't as easy as you'd think, but it isn't over yet...

CZ75: I can do this all day.

NZ75: Hmph, don't get cocky. The same goes for me!

Another 25 minutes went by.

Type 97: Ugh...hnggg...

Type 97: N-No! I can't do it anymore... I give up!

Type 97: Look at that, NZ75 and CZ75 are still going strong.

Type 95: (Sighs) You've had your fun. Haven't you had enough, 97?

Type 97: Hmm... I know, sis...

Type 97: But the duel isn't over yet, and I agreed to be the referee.

Type 95: You're right - a promise is a promise. You can't just break your word.

Type 95: Then I'll start preparing without you. Come find me when you're done.

Type 97: Alright, alright!

CZ75: No... you can go with Type 95. We don't mind.

Type 97: Huh?? But don't you need a referee?

Type 97: Shouldn't I be keeping an eye on you?

NZ75: I agree with CZ75. I can keep going for a long time, and she doesn't seem to be giving up any time soon either.

NZ75: Hey, CZ75, you aren't jamming your foot firmly into the ground with some secret contraption, are you?

CZ75: You think I'd resort to such shoddy tricks?

CZ75 does a little hop.

CZ75: See? That was all smooth sailing, and there's nothing underneath my shoe.

CZ75: Just admit defeat, NZ75.

NZ75: Sorry for making a false accusation. My bad. But that doesn't mean I'm admitting defeat! We'll see who can last till the very end!

Type 97: Then I'll be going, okay?

Type 97: See you later at the New Year visits. Bye... Wait for me, sis!

Type 97 takes off running after Type 95.

The time is 2235.

IWS 2000: Hailing NZ75. Most of the participants of the New Year visits are ready. Where are you?

NZ75: Hmph... I can still go on.

NZ75: IWS 2000, sorry but you'll have to wait a bit. I have to win this duel!

IWS 2000: ...Duel?

IWS 2000: What are you doing? Are you in danger, NZ75?

IWS 2000: Give me your location!

NZ75: No, I'm at the base. Don't worry, IWS 2000... I'm just having a showdown with CZ75.

CZ75: The call is distracting you. Your body is swaying, you know?

NZ75: ...Crap! Anyway, please give me some time. I need to focus! Bye!

The time is 2305.

IWS 2000: I heard you were having a duel... So this is how you're dueling?

CZ75: Sure. Got a problem with that?

IWS 2000: Not at all. I find it a bit puzzling, but it's none of my business.

IWS 2000: New Year's is only 55 minutes away. I'm here to see if NZ75 can make it on time.

NZ75: ...If I put my foot down and go, I'll lose to CZ75. That's unacceptable.

IWS 2000: Then the alternative is...

CZ75: Same here. If I give up now, I'll lose to her!

CZ75: This is no longer just a fight to decide who gets to lead the activity tonight. It has turned into a showdown to determine who is superior.

IWS 2000: But someone has to organize the whole thing... Can't you continue the duel some other time?

IWS 2000: We should prioritize the group activity...

NZ75: ...

NZ75: IWS 2000, we're counting on you.

IWS 2000: ...Huh?

NZ75: You'll have to organize it.

NZ75: Neither CZ75 nor I will admit defeat for any reason, so someone has to take charge... It's in your hands, IWS 2000.

IWS 2000: But...

IWS 2000: ...I understand. Leave it to me.

Midnight. As the New Year bell starts ringing, the base grows lively.

CZ75 is distracted by the hubbub coming from inside the base.

CZ75: They're making their visits.

NZ75: Do you regret not going?

CZ75: A bit.

CZ75: But I can't go back on my promise.

NZ75: Yeah...? That's what I think too.

NZ75: ...

NZ75: Happy New Year, CZ75.

CZ75: You beat me to saying that!

CZ75: ...Happy New Year to you too, NZ75.

NZ75: That's because you let down your guard. You can't be complacent even when it comes to making well wishes. That's what it takes to be a good leader, don't you think?

CZ75: What kind of nonsense is that?!

CZ75: Whatever. I can't be bothered to argue with you... It's New Year after all. We'll continue this discussion after I beat you!

The time is 0300. The New Year visits are over. New figures appear at the base entrance.

Spitfire: Is it this way?

Gr HK45: I only heard that they're somewhere around here, but I can't get in touch with them at all... I'm a bit worried.

Spitfire: ...What on earth... Oh, I see them! They're over there! 75, answer me! Are you two alright?

CZ75: ...

NZ75: ...

Gr HK45: No hostile signals in the vicinity. I'm going in!

Gr HK45: ...

Spitfire: What is it, Gr HK45?

Spitfire: ...

Spitfire: What...

Gr HK45: They've completely drained their own batteries...

Gr HK45: What the hell have they been doing here?

Spitfire: I don't know either...

Spitfire: In any case, I'll bring CZ75 back. Can you carry NZ75, Gr HK45?

Gr HK45: Of course! Piece of cake for an Idol!

The time is 0500.

CZ75: ...Hmm...

CZ75: How did I get back to the dorm...?

Spitfire: Good morning, 75. The New Year visits were a great success.

CZ75: ...What? Is it over already?!

CZ75: Where's NZ75?

Spitfire: Like you, her battery ran out, so she must also be charging up back in her own dorm.

Spitfire: So, what exactly were the two of you doing?

CZ75: We were having a duel... Damn! Now we can't tell who won!

NZ75: What are you talking about, CZ75?

NZ75: So you're all charged up already.

CZ75: ...Humph.

CZ75: We'll have another duel. I won't settle for a draw.

NZ75 grins. She obviously has no intention of giving up either.

NZ75: In that case, let's prepare for a second round.

NZ75: At 0700, when QJY-88 leads the morning visits. We'll see if you are any match for me!

CZ75: My thoughts precisely! Just you wait, NZ75!

Spitfire: Jeez, it's the first day of a new year.

Spitfire: But I'll admit... 75 looks pretty cool...

NZ75: New year, new look, new battles! It all starts now!
