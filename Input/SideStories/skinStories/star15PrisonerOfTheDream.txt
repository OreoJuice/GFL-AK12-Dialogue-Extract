...

...Shortly before the banquet.

ST AR-15 leans against the doorway and watches silently as the other Dolls chatter with each other.

ST AR-15: This dress is really restricting.

ST AR-15: Tsk, 16 said anyone would enjoy themselves as soon as they arrive... Totally just speaking for herself.

She gives her dress another tug.

ST AR-15: How can any Doll move around freely wearing something like this?

???: NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!

A momentary silence follows the bellow at the bustling venue.

ST AR-15: Hm? Isn't that SOP-II?

ST AR-15: ...Why is she yelling at thin air?

ST AR-15 walks towards SOP-II and drags her aside.

ST AR-15: SOP-II, what—

SOP-II grabs ST AR-15 by the collar and shouts into her face.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm not letting you go this time!

ST AR-15: ...What's gotten into you, SOP-II?

ST AR-15 frees herself from SOP-II's grip anxiously. SOP-II's vacant eyes gradually focus on her.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Sobs) 15...

ST AR-15: A-Are you okay?

ST AR-15: What happened? Did someone bully you?

SOP-II suddenly bursts into tears, leaving ST AR-15 completely baffled.

M4 SOPMOD II: You were leaving me behind again...

ST AR-15: No, I wasn't.

M4 SOPMOD II: I saw you!

ST AR-15: ...

She is reluctant to revisit that memory, but she knows exactly what SOP-II is talking about.

ST AR-15: Your memory is all jumbled. Here, have a drink to cool your head.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

SOP-II looks straight into her eyes, as if to probe her thoughts.

Then she passes her bottle to ST AR-15.

ST AR-15: Let's drink together and chase away the bad memories.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then be prepared to down a few glasses. I was devastated...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Alright, alright, I'll drink a few with you.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, M4 bought this! It tastes really good!

ST AR-15: What? You opened M4's—

ST AR-15 remembers that M4 has mentioned buying liquor for M16. But the moment her thoughts stray, SOP-II manages to pour the contents of the bottle into her mouth.

M4 SOPMOD II: Good, drink up!

ST AR-15: (Gargles)

She tries to break free, but she can't so much as wriggle under SOP-II's freakish strength.

The bottle is soon empty.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15 slumps onto the floor, the world spinning wildly.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe... Now have a pastry! RO saved them for me!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll let you have two... No, I'll let you have one!

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: (Did SOP-II change into a different dress?)

She stares dumbly at SOP-II and struggles to voice her confusion.

M4 SOPMOD II: You don't want it? Then they're all mine!

M4 SOPMOD II: (Munches)

M4 SOPMOD II: How refreshing... I-I'm floating again!

SOP-II turns around and readies herself for a sprint.

ST AR-15: Wait, SOP-II!

SOP-II has already disappeared from her sight.

ST AR-15 gets back on her feet unsteadily and stumbles after her, but her vision is blurry and patchy.

ST AR-15: Hold on, SOP-II! Stop running!

She pushes open the door in front of her...

The moment the door swings open, the banquet hall around her falls away, leaving only a sea of flowers.

ST AR-15: What's going on?! Where am I?

ST AR-15: I was just at the banquet hall...

ST AR-15 looks around in confusion. The door has completely vanished.

ST AR-15: Has my neural cloud been hacked?

ST AR-15: ...Dammit, I've got to find SOP-II.

ST AR-15: SOP-II! SOP-II, stay put!

She pushes through the bushes of flowers, searching for SOP-II.

Her distressed calls have attracted the attention of several other Dolls.

ST AR-15: SOP-II, where are you?!

???: 15...

ST AR-15 feels her dress snag on something and turns around sharply with her gun raised.

ST AR-15: M-M4?

M4A1: 15, are you looking for SOP-II?

ST AR-15: Yes, I...

ST AR-15: Hold on, what are YOU doing here? And why are you wearing a different dress?

M4A1: What are you talking about? I've been here the whole time, wearing the same thing.

ST AR-15: You...

M4 looks down at her dress and fiddles with the hem. As ST AR-15 watches her, an idea occurs to her.

ST AR-15: M4, what exactly are you wearing?

M4A1: The evening dress that we ordered together.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15 gawks silently at M4's bunny ears and huge bunch of balloons.

M4A1: What's the matter, 15?

M4A1: You say such weird things. And why did you run out of the banquet hall all of a sudden?

ST AR-15: I'm fine...

ST AR-15: I probably drank a bit too much...

ST AR-15: Damn SOP-II, where the heck has she run off to?

M4A1: SOP-II has been acting very strangely. She just said I'd told her I was going somewhere far away...

ST AR-15: She also said I was going on a solo mission and leaving her behind.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Why is she thinking of such unhappy things on this day of all days?

ST AR-15: She's probably experiencing some kind of neural dissonance caused by excessive alcohol consumption.

M4 takes in ST AR-15's bright red face.

M4A1: She made you drink quite a bit, didn't she? Good thing you seem to be alright.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15 stares at this space filled with absurdity and can only smile helplessly.

ST AR-15: (Send me back to reality, dammit...)

ST AR-15: I'm going after SOP-II. We'd better track her down before she causes any big trouble.

M4A1: Right, I'll also ask around.

M4 tugs on her balloons, which inflate rapidly and lift her high into the sky.

ST AR-15 stares into the distance in stunned silence for a good long while.

ST AR-15: ...I'm hallucinating. This must all be a hallucination!

ST AR-15: Pull yourself together!!!

...She keeps searching through the sweeping sea of flowers for a long time.

ST AR-15: ...With the banquet hall looking like this, I can't tell where I'm going at all.

ST AR-15: Even if someone else shows me the way, I'm seeing something different.

ST AR-15: Where on earth did SOP-II go?

RO635's Voice: 15, what are you doing running all over the place on your own?

RO walks over with concern all over her face and a pair of bunny ears on her head.

ST AR-15: You too, RO?

ST AR-15: Pfft, it suits you.

RO635: Thanks. But what you do mean, me "too"?

ST AR-15: Nothing...

ST AR-15: I'm looking for SOP-II, but I keep losing track of her.

RO635: Same here. I haven't seen her the whole day. Who knows what kind of trouble she's getting herself into.

RO635: She hasn't been answering her calls either...

ST AR-15: Don't worry, M4 has flown...uh... She's been asking around about her.

RO635: Flown? Are you sure you're alright, 15?

ST AR-15: I'm fine...

RO635: Why do you reek of boo—

???: HAAAAAAAAGH!

That familiar shout of exertion catches RO's attention.

RO635: That's SOP-II!

ST AR-15: We'd better head over and see what she's up to.

ST AR-15 and RO follow SOP-II's voice and eventually run into M16 and M4.

ST AR-15: We just heard—

ST AR-15: Pfft, never thought I'd see you with bunny ears, 16.

M16A1: Hm? What bunny ears?

M16A1: M16's bunny ears twitch in confusion.

ST AR-15: Hahahahaha...

RO635: Have you seen SOP-II?

M4A1: She suddenly charged at 16 and lifted her up.

M4A1: SOP-II has always been mischievous, but something doesn't seem right with her today.

ST AR-15: She lifted you up? That's pretty impressive...

M16A1: Haha, she's just drunk. You don't have to be so worried.

RO's face darkens.

RO635: ...

RO635: Which way did she go?

M16A1: Well...

M4A1: 16?

M16 grins, and her ears twitch playfully.

M16A1: Let's dance, 15.

ST AR-15: This isn't the time for jokes, is it?

M16A1: I'm not joking. We can count on RO to hunt down the plastered SOP-II.

M4A1: You do need to relax, 15.

Though M4 tries not to show it, ST AR-15 can still see the concern in her eyes.

Is she causing the others as much worry as SOP-II?

RO635: Indeed. I can handle this on my own.

ST AR-15: ...

M16A1: She just ran out through the door.

RO635: Thanks, I'll catch up with her.

RO rushes out of the banquet hall immediately.

M16A1: Now, it's just you and I.

M16 holds out her hand gracefully in invitation.

M16A1: Miss AR-15, may I have this dance?

ST AR-15: ...

M4A1: Go and have some fun, 15. I'll get you two some pastries.

M4 smiles and pushes her towards M16.

ST AR-15 is left with no choice but to take M16's hand.

M16A1: Here. Can you keep up with the tempo?

ST AR-15: Yeah.

With M16 in the lead, the two Dolls dance among the flowers.

Their dresses rustle against the delicate blooms, causing them to whisper.

ST AR-15 looks up. Through the flurry of petals swirling through the sky, she sees a few clouds gilded by sunlight.

M16A1: Would you rather stare at the ceiling than look at me?

ST AR-15: What you call a ceiling may look like something else entirely to me.

M16A1: Whatever you say, as long as you have fun.

ST AR-15: ...

She sighs lightly. She tears her eyes off the sky and focuses properly on the dance.

In her peripheral vision, she sees M4 beaming at her with a plate of pastries in her hands.

M16A1: Don't worry about SOP-II. RO just sent an update saying that she's already captured her and is about to escort her back to the dorm.

M16A1: Pack up some food for them afterwards.

ST AR-15: Right.

ST AR-15 nods expressionlessly, but deep down, she is starting to get attached to this fantasy world.

ST AR-15: It's not so bad even if things stay this way forever...
