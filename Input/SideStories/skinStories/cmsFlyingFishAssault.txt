...

...In the command room.

The Commander is reading the latest combat report.

A Doll comes barging in.

C-MS: Commander, come and have a water gun battle with me!

Commander: Oh, C-MS. What's this sudden interest in water guns?

C-MS: Gee, summer is almost over! You know what that means?

C-MS: If we don't play with water guns now we'll have to wait till next year!

Commander: Oh right, summer is almost over...

Commander: You have a point, C-MS.

C-MS: Heheh, then—

Z-62: Commander, may I come in?

Commander: You already did...

Commander: What is it?

Z-62: I would like your help in choosing a swimsuit. What do you think about this one?

C-MS: (...I came first, you know.)

C-MS: (...!)

C-MS: (I never paid attention, but damn, she's got things to show off...)

Serdyukov: Is anybody in? I'm coming in!

Serdyukov: Hmm? Things look quite lively in here.

Serdyukov: Commander, I've just sent you the security plans for the location.

C-MS: (...How do they just keep coming? I was here first!)

C-MS: (This one's got a nice figure too... I also want to... Never mind.)

C-MS: Hey, how come you're in a swimsuit as well?

Serdyukov: Didn't Kalina tell you? We're about to go searching for mermaids.

C-MS: Oh, that... I thought it was a scam.

C-MS: After all, that woman is always eyeing my bonus pay...

Commander: Don't let Kalina hear that...

Commander: Z-62, I'll help you with your swimsuit when I have time.

Commander: And thanks for the security plan, Serdyukov.

Commander: I looked through it briefly and it seemed okay. I'll give you more detailed feedback later.

C-MS glowers at the other two Dolls.

Commander: C-MS, I like your idea about the water gun battle. Maybe you can organize it on the beach.

C-MS: ...

C-MS: Right.

Commander: Why are you so indifferent all of a sudden...?

C-MS: ...

C-MS: ...Humph, I'm going!

Huh...?

The Commander addressed the girls in the swimsuits first!

Even though I outrank them and had been waiting for an answer before they were even there...!

Those bastards...with their dirty tricks...

Fine, I'm gonna drop the pretense as a pure and chaste Doll! I also have a swimsuit!

...

N-no, this is way too embarrassing...

Dammit! I can't wear this!

...The mermaid investigation has commenced.

C-MS: (Darn, I ended up wearing it...)

Commander: That swimsuit really suits you.

Commander: But the jacket seems a bit oversized. Should I come with you to pick one that fits you better?

Commander: That'll make it easier to move around.

C-MS: ...N-none of your business!

C-MS: More importantly, how dare you put me on the reserve team?!

C-MS: I'm the boss, so shouldn't I be giving out orders on the beach chair?!

Z-62: Um, C-MS...

C-MS: Whatever. Since you're my trusty subordinate, I guess I'll humor you for now.

The Commander chuckles helplessly and hands C-MS and Z-62 a set of commands.

C-MS: What's this...?

Commander: Your job is to help out the other teams.

Commander: Unexpected things tend to happen very often in investigations, which makes the reserve team the most indispensable.

Commander: If you two run into any trouble, feel free and come to me.

Z-62: R-right...

C-MS: Fine, I suppose I'm the only one who can handle such an important job.

C-MS: Wait, you said "you two"...? There's someone else on the team?

Commander: ...She's standing right next to you.

C-MS looks around and finally notices the dainty Doll standing next to her.

C-MS: Oh...

Z-62: ...Hello, C-MS.

C-MS: Nice to meet you, new subordinate of mine.

Commander: C-MS, you met Z-62 back in the command room.

C-MS: Did I?

Commander: If you think of her as your subordinate, at least remember her face...

Z-62: It's okay, we have time to get to know each other...

Z-62: After all, I know I don't make much of an impression...

Then the arrangement is settled.

Commander: C-MS, take Z-62 around and keep an eye out for anyone who needs help.

Commander: That's it, now start your mission.

C-MS: Tsk, ordering me around as if I were the subordinate... How presumptuous.

C-MS: You'd better give me a shoulder massage when I'm back!

Z-62: Um...the Commander is already gone...

C-MS: What?!

C-MS: The Commander asked us to help people out, but nobody seems to need any help.

C-MS: So why don't we have a water gun battle instead, New Subordinate?

Z-62: ...

Z-62: "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to..."

C-MS: Hello?

Curious, C-MS leans over to take a closer look at Z-62's book.

C-MS: You have the habit of reading novels out loud?

Z-62: No, it's just that I never managed to finish this one, so I thought if I...

Z-62: Whoa!

Z-62 snaps the book shut in panic.

Z-62: C...C-MS, is something the matter?

C-MS: Don't tell me you're slacking off...?

Z-62: No...I'm not...

Z-62: I just want to finish this book soon...

C-MS: This won't do. If the Commander finds out you're slacking...

Z-62: ...Eep!

C-MS: You don't want that, do you?

C-MS: Then from now on, do exactly as I say.

Z-62: But...

C-MS: Where's your answer?

Z-62: YES, SIR!

C-MS: (Heheh, easy-peasy... Free labor, acquired!)

...

An hour later...

Z-62 is about to return to C-MS.

C-MS: Well?

Z-62: The mint-flavored ones are sold out...

C-MS: How...could that be?!

C-MS: So this one I'm having is the last one they had?

Z-62: Surely you've had enough... It's already the 20th...

Z-62: The shop owner probably recognizes me already...

C-MS: Alright, alright.

C-MS: Take a break for now and prepare for your next job.

Z-62: I have a question...

Z-62: Um...well... Does what I've been doing...help in the search for mermaids?

C-MS: Of course. Buying popsicles was a test to see how good you are at conducting searches.

C-MS: Now...the investigation truly begins.

Z-62: S-so...the thing from before...

C-MS: What thing?

Z-62: You know...the thing...about me slacking off...?

C-MS: You slacked off?

Z-62: So it's already deleted from her neural cloud...

C-MS: No idea what you're talking about.

C-MS: Keep up the good work and you'll become an outstanding subordinate. As your next task...bring me a local watermelon.

Z-62: R-roger that!

Z-62: (This is the first time someone's had such high hopes for me... I have to work hard!)

C-MS: (Come to think of it, what's her name again...?)

C-MS: (Phew...never mind, I'm getting sleepy.)

...

Soon afterwards, a groggy C-MS receives a transmission from Z-62.

Z-62: Um...I've bought the watermelon.

Z-62: Is there anything else you'd like me to do?

C-MS: Zzz...

Z-62: C-MS?

C-MS: The watermelon...zzz...is only good...zzz...if it's chilled...zzz...

Z-62: Huh? Ch-chilled watermelon? Okay... Um, C-MS, where are you now?

Z-62: Huh? Hello? C-MS...?

...ZzzzZzzz...

...

Why, you...

C-MS: ...

C-MS: Ugh...five more minutes...

C-MS: ...Commander?

C-MS: Commander, what are you doing here?!

Commander: So you're finally awake.

Commander: I can't believe the capable C-MS I know would actually abandon her mission and snooze here on her own.

C-MS: ...N-no, that's not true!

C-MS: It's just really boring here!

Commander: ...Didn't you say you wanted a water gun battle? If you're done with your job, then go and have some fun with the others.

C-MS: Humph, I was just about to do that.

Click, click, click.

A message comes through the Commander's communicator.

Commander: Actually, I just received a request for help from another team.

Commander: Why don't you go in my place?

C-MS: No, I want to play with water guns.

Commander: You can play all you want after the mission...

Commander: Right, take Z-62 along with you as well.

C-MS: (How dare a mere subordinate give me orders... Just you watch as I complete this mission in flying colors...)

Commander: C-MS?

C-MS: Alright!

C-MS: I'm going!

Commander: I was going to come with you too, but there's something else I must attend to right now.

Commander: I'll spend some time with you when I'm back.

C-MS: Humph, don't forget the shoulder massage...

C-MS: ...

C-MS: Gone again!

C-MS: Never mind. I'll see what the others want first.

C-MS: Say, who's Z-62 again?

4 Shiki: It's over! It's all over.

4 Shiki: Oh dearie... Our manuscript...

C-MS: Hey, did you send the message?

4 Shiki: Help is here!

4 Shiki: C-MS! Let me explain the situation...

...4 Shiki spends ten minutes ranting non-stop.

C-MS: Your drafts all got soaked? That's a shame.

4 Shiki: What am I going to do now...?

C-MS: (Slowly draws her water gun) Yeah, I wonder.

4 Shiki: What...what's wrong? Why art thou taking out thy gun? Did we do something wrong?

C-MS: You kept talking about your manga, which means...you haven't been searching for the mermaid, have you?

4 Shiki: Huh? Well...

C-MS: You've gone astray, 4 Shiki.

C-MS: ...It is my duty to put you back on track.

A gunshot.

4 Shiki collapses in a puddle of water.

C-MS squats down and smacks her softly on the face but gets no reaction.

C-MS: It actually scared this Doll so much she just passed out.

C-MS: This gunshot simulator MDR recommended is pretty good.

Lewis: What do you think about this sunscreen?

C-MS: It works pretty well.

C-MS: But you asked me to come all this way to put sunscreen on you?

Lewis: Yeah, actually, I was going to ask the Commander.

Lewis: After all, there are so many spots I can't reach on my own.

C-MS: You want the Commander to do such things...? What about your mission?

Lewis: Physical appeal is a Doll's best advantage, you know?

Lewis: The mermaid can wait.

Bang, another gunshot.

Lewis also collapses in a puddle of water. C-MS blows lightly at the muzzle of her water gun.

C-MS: Even Lewis has fallen to depravity.

C-MS: Now let me see, who's next?

Serdyukov: QJY-88, hang in there! The Commander will be here soon!

QJY-88: Hmm...

C-MS: The Commander isn't coming.

Serdyukov: Wha—!

Bang, the gunshot...didn't happen.

Only a squirt of droplets hit Serdyukov in the face.

C-MS: Huh? Is it out of battery?

Serdyukov: C-MS...you're the one that's been causing trouble, aren't you?

C-MS: N-no, I just want to play...I mean, help you guys.

Serdyukov: Didn't you just say you wanted to play?

Serdyukov: Madam Sakamoto, get her!

C-MS: Madam what? Who's that?

C-MS: Whoaaaaaaaa what's going on?! Ahhhhh!

A crow lunges at C-MS's face.

Serdyukov: I can always count on my capable partner, Madam Sakamoto.

C-MS: I'm sorry, okay? Please let me go?

Serdyukov: Nope, you're coming with me to apologize to everyone.

C-MS: ...

C-MS: Humph, now's the time—

C-MS throws out her unfinished popsicle, drawing Madam Sakamoto's attention away.

Serdyukov: Hey!

C-MS: Smell ya lateeer!

4 Shiki: No sign of thee in the west.

Lewis: No sign of her in the east either.

Serdyukov: She must be hiding from me. Just you wait...

Serdyukov: I'm going to catch you.

...In a small villa by the sea.

C-MS: Finally, a place to hide...

C-MS: How did things turn out like this?

C-MS: I just wanted to help them correct their disobedient ways, gee...

All of a sudden, C-MS hears a set of fast-approaching footsteps.

C-MS: Who's there?!

Z-62: It's me, C-MS.

C-MS: You are...?

C-MS: Never mind, whoever you are, just help me look outside and see if Serdyukov is gone.

Z-62 sighs.

Z-62: Fine...

Z-62: Give me the water gun.

C-MS: Hmm? Why?

Z-62: That's your "murder weapon", isn't it?

Z-62: I'm going to draw Serdyukov away with it.

Z-62 pushes her glasses up her nose at the end of that sentence.

C-MS: I see, I see!

C-MS: Take it. But the gunshot simulator seems to be out of battery, so it's just a regular water gun now.

Z-62 takes the water gun. She considers what C-MS just said for a second, and her lips curl up into a faint smile.

Z-62: In other words... No one would find out even if I shoot you with it, right?

C-MS: Yeah.

C-MS: ...

C-MS: Huh?

Z-62: Remember my name! I am Z-62!

Z-62: You keep calling me your subordinate, but what kind of good-for-nothing boss would leave their subordinate in the sea for an entire day?!

Z-62: Stupid C-MS!

Squirt, squirt, squirt. Z-62 keeps shooting at C-MS, each drizzle of water hitting her smack in between her eyes.

C-MS: H...help...!

C-MS runs out from the villa and right into⁠—

Serdyukov: Finally, gotcha.

C-MS: Eep...!

C-MS cowers on the ground with her head buried in her arms.

Commander: C-MS, you really shouldn't have done that.

Commander: You could've simply helped everyone.

C-MS: They all looked like they were playing around! And they all have such nice figures!

Commander: Why, you...

Serdyukov: Commander, just leave her here to reflect on her own behavior.

4 Shiki: We agree with Serdyukov.

4 Shiki: Oh yes, Commander... There are only a few slices of watermelon left...so...

Commander: Yeah, I'll go cut some more.

4 Shiki: How shameful. We wouldn't have to trouble you if our hands were as nimble as a human's.

Commander: It's fine, I brought you all here to wind down and relax anyways.

Commander: Besides, you have your own mission.

Commander: C-MS, think long and hard about what you have done.

Commander: If you behave, I might give you some watermelon later.

C-MS: ...Humph!

Once the Commander and the others have left, Z-62 sneaks over with two slices of watermelon.

Z-62: C-MS...

C-MS: What now?

Z-62: I have some watermelon here. Want a slice?

C-MS mumbles a ‘yes' and takes it.

Z-62: Are you angry, C-MS?

C-MS: Huh? Why would I be angry?

Z-62 smiles at her reply.

Z-62: Well...

Z-62: I only did that because I want you to remember me...

Z-62: After all, as you said, I'm your subordinate.

C-MS: Pff. Pfft...

C-MS spits out a few watermelon seeds by her feet.

C-MS: This watermelon has a lot of seeds.

C-MS: But it tastes pretty good. Thanks.

Z-62: So...

Z-62: You don't mind at all...? I suppose I worry too much...

Z-62: Actually, I'm very happy to be on the same team as you today.

Z-62: Because...no one has ever given me so many orders...

Z-62: I'll go get you more watermelon.

C-MS: Hmm... What did you say?

C-MS: Hmm? She's gone already?

Commander: C-MS, have you been reflecting on your behavior? I've brought you some watermelon.

Commander: Hmm? All these seeds on the ground... Did someone sneak you some?

C-MS: It's that girl. What's her name again...?

Commander: ...

Z-62: C-MS...what did you just say...?

Clang... The pearly white fruit platter and the crimson watermelon slide off Z-62's hands.

Everything falls onto the ground with a crash.

C-MS: ...W-what is it? Did I say something wrong?

A sudden breeze blows past, rustling the leaves in the trees.

Commander: I was going to tell you to treasure this day...

Commander: But it looks like I don't need to.

C-MS: Hey, w-why are you taking out your gun?!

Z-62: My name is Z-62... My name is Z-62... My name is Z-62...

C-MS: Commander, save me! She's making a scary face!

Z-62: Listen well – I am Z! Sixty! Two!

Z-62: Can you still not remember my name?!

C-MS: My bad, my bad...!

In the clear moonlight, the sound of C-MS and Z-62's bickering fills the entire beach.

The Commander gazes upon this precious scene...

Commander: I just hope they can always be happy like this, although such peaceful days...

The Commander silently makes a promise...

Even though it is uncertain when they will get to experience this summertime bliss again...

If they will ever get to experience it again at all.
