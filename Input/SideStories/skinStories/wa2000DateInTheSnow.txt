Griffin base.

Commander: Decorations, presents, venue preparations... All checked.

Commander: Alright, next on the list is food and beverages.

Outside the wine cellar, I run into WA2000,

Who, according to Springfield's arrangement, is in charge of beverages for this event.

WA2000: What are you doing here, Commander?

Commander: Springfield asked me to check the prep work on the resources needed for Christmas.

WA2000: That's hardly necessary...

WA2000: My preparation is naturally impeccable!

Commander: I believe you, of course, but I still need to do what has to be done.

Commander: Just think of it as a routine inspection and let me take a look.

WA2000: V-Very well.

WA2000: No sneaking drinks even for you, Commander!

Commander: ...For some reason, WA seems a bit strange today.

Commander: So I'm nothing but an alcoholic to you...

WA2000: ...No! It's just a reminder!

WA2000: A-Anyway, get to work already! I've still got things to do.

I check the purchased beverages in the cellar according to the stock list and quickly notice a mismatch.

Commander: WA, I just checked the list. We seem to be missing five bottles of champagne.

WA2000: Oh, that...I broke them by accident when I was moving the crates.

Commander: Why didn't you tell me before?

WA2000: There's no need to report something so trivial, is there?

WA2000: I was just about to head out and buy some new ones, but then you came.

Commander: I see...

Commander: Sorry for keeping you from your work.

WA2000: Humph. If you get it, then move along already. I need to lock up.

Commander: How about I go with you as an apology? It's not easy for you to carry five bottles of champagne on your own, is it?

WA2000: It's a piece of cake for T-Dolls.

WA2000: But if you absolutely have to come...it's not like I won't let you.

Commander: Then without further ado, let's be off.

WA2000 and I walk together along the street.

She's in casual dress today, looking no different than the chattering girls on the street...

If not for the enormous travel bag on her shoulders.

Commander: Why are you carrying such a big bag, WA?

WA2000: We T-Dolls always carry our firearms with us even on normal occasions.

WA2000: That's common sense, Commander!

Commander: I know that, but your rifle isn't the only thing in that bag, is it?

Commander: These furry things are...plush toys?

WA2000: ...Don't touch them! Th-They're just ordinary presents.

Commander: Alright, alright... But aren't they heavy?

WA2000: That's none of your business!

WA2000: Let's hurry and buy what we need to buy. If we can't make it, it'll be entirely your fault when we get scolded by Springfield!

Commander: Okay, okay. Milady's word is my command.

WA2000: ...Humph.

WA2000 and I arrive at the alcohol section of the supermarket. We put the champagne into our cart.

Just as we're about to check out, WA2000 stops at the wine shelves.

Commander: What is it, WA? Have we forgotten something?

WA2000: ...Glühwein.

WA2000: We drink this at Christmas where I'm from.

Commander: Really? Then here.

I put the bottle that WA has been staring at into our cart.

WA2000: But it's not on the stock list, Commander.

Commander: I just want to try it.

Commander: Mind sharing it with me tonight?

WA2000: Gosh... If you want to try it so much...

WA2000: I guess it doesn't hurt to have a drink with you.

WA turns away and pushes the cart toward the checkout section.

She might have agreed a bit grudgingly, but I'm sure I saw a smile.

Back in the cellar at Griffin base.

WA picks up the bottle of Glühwein that she bought with the commander and sighs.

WA2000: Goodness... Everyone is such a handful.

WA2000 recalls what happened earlier in the day...

Griffin T-Dolls: Please, WA! This is a crucial part of our plan!

Griffin T-Dolls: These are electronic pets that we modified ourselves... Take them as gifts of thanks.

Griffin T-Dolls: Yeah! We beg you, WA! Just let us have five bottles!

Griffin T-Dolls: And don't tell anyone!

WA2000 looks at the bag full of bribes.

She finds herself in the toughest dilemma ever.

WA2000: What to do? Should I tell Commander?

WA2000: ...Humph. Why should I worry about that idiot?

WA2000: Surely the commander can neutralize such a tiny threat.

WA2000 stands up and puts the mulled wine carefully on the table.

WA2000: Besides, I've been toiling away the entire day...

WA2000: This wine will make up for it nicely.

WA2000: But...when should I open it?

WA2000: ...Guess I'll do it 'then'.

After the Christmas Eve celebration kicked off, the T-Dolls' little plot was naturally foiled.

The clamorous interlude has not ruined anyone's festive mood. The T-Dolls keep up the joyous buzz late into the night.

WA2000: What are you doing skulking in the corner, Commander?

WA stands before me, holding two glasses filled with dark crimson liquid.

Commander: Hello, WA. I'm taking a rest here after a day of work.

Commander: Aren't you gonna drink with them?

WA2000: I've taken pity on you sitting here all alone, so I'll keep you company.

WA2000: It's not like you've got anything to do at the moment, right?

WA places one of the glasses in front of me. I can immediately smell the aromatic wine.

Commander: Yeah, thanks.

Commander: What's this?

WA2000: Glühwein.

WA2000: ...I'm just keeping my word from this morning.

WA2000 mutters and sits down next to me.

Commander: Merry Christmas, WA.

I raise my glass toward WA. She purses her lips, then clinks her glass lightly against mine.

WA2000: ...Merry Christmas.

The heated wine warms me up from head to toe.

I look at WA's profile and spy a rare smile on her lips.
