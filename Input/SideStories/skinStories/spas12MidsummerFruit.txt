SPAS-12: The seaside...the seaside... We're finally at the seaside...

On the beach, SPAS-12 hums an off-key tune of her own invention as she fiddles with her shield...

...Or at least, what had once been a shield.

Commander: Er, SP... I mean, Sabrina...

SPAS-12: What is it, Commander?

SPAS-12 is already in her swimsuit and she's looking intently at me, eager to enjoy the beach...with that former shield in hand?

Commander: Is that...your riot shield?

SPAS-12: Oh, this? It was a training tool I used once. Ah, that brings back memories...

Commander: And so you brought it today for...surfing?

SPAS-12: Surfing!

Commander: So you can surf? That would need excellent balance and control.

SPAS-12: What's with that look of yours? I've practiced this countless times in the VR simulator!

Commander: So you've never done it for real, huh...

Commander: Also, who put that stuff in the simulator?!

Commander: And back to my point, is it really okay to go surfing on this riot shield?

SPAS-12: Hehe, I specially modified it into a surfboard for this beach operation! How is it, pretty neat, huh?

Commander: It looks cool. I didn't think you knew how to modify these things.

SPAS-12: (Shakes head) Hehe, there's a lot of things you can only enjoy if you do them with your own hands, Commander!

SPAS-12: Also, I'm capable of a lot more than this. Looks like you haven't been paying enough attention to me.

Commander: Sorry about that. I'll do better in the future.

SPAS-12: In the future?! You'd best start paying attention to me now!

SPAS-12: Commander, please carefully observe my wave-riding skills.

SPAS-12 dumps the modified surfboard onto the beach with a dull thunk.

SPAS-12: By the time I come back to the beach, you'll be begging me to teach you how to surf!

Commander: Alright, alright, hurry up and go while the beach isn't crowded yet, Sabrina.

SPAS-12: Hehe, well, at least you remembered my name.

SPAS-12 clutches her surfboard to herself, then hops and skips and runs to the water's edge.

Come to think of it, she's been asking me to call her Sabrina all this time, and I don't remember when exactly I started humoring her.

Was it to make her seem more human? Or was there a special meaning to that name...?

Still, today isn't a day for thinking about such things. Today ought to be spent on relaxing, so I shouldn't let any accidents interrupt us—

??: Good day, Griffin T-Doll.

SPAS-12: Huh? You're...

SPAS-12: ...Who are you?

AK-12: I am a T-Doll, just like you.

SPAS-12: Hmm... I could tell.

AK-12: My, you're more wary than I expected. I was simply curious...

SPAS-12: That's just a surfboard. There's nothing special about it.

AK-12: You noticed the direction of my gaze?

SPAS-12: Who exactly are you, anyway?

AK-12: Don't worry, I'm a friend. Your Commander will vouch for that. Oh yes, do you like beach volleyball?

SPAS-12: Hah?

AK-12: We're planning to organize a beach volleyball match. Would you like to join us?

SPAS-12: A volleyball match? What's that?

AK-12: It's a game where people volley the ball back and forth. The winner gets a prize.

SPAS-12: Sorry, but I'm not interested in prizes. Now, I intend to have fun here for a while, so if there's nothing else...

AK-12: Ah, but if we win, we'll be taking the prize from you. Do you know what it is?

SPAS-12: W-what is it...

AK-12: Hehe, I haven't decided yet.

SPAS-12: Eh?! But how can you make that decision by yourself?

AK-12: Your Commander agreed to it.

SPAS-12: The Commander... Why?

AK-12: Aw, it's just a game anyway. If you don't want to play, I can always ask your other friends.

SPAS-12: I'm in!

SPAS-12 raises a hand up high.

SPAS-12: I don't know what this volleying ball stuff is about, but I won't lose to you!

SPAS-12: That T-Doll with the closed eyes was peering at my surfboard the whole time...

SPAS-12: Does she know what it is? Is she going to name that as the stakes? Why did the Commander agree to this...?

SPAS-12: No matter what, she's being too curious. I won't lose to that squinty-eye, whoever she is!

...Bang!

AK-12: AN-94 scores!

AK-12: My... Does that mean we win again?

Commander: If...if this keeps up, it won't end well...

Commander: The two of them only LOOK like they're playing around — they're actually dead serious!

AK-12: I'm up next.

AK-12: And my opponent will be...

SPAS-12: Me. I'm the last one.

AK-12: Ah... Miss SPAS-12, hmm? I've been looking forward to this.

Commander: Did SPAS-12 run into Task Force DEFY before this? The look in her eyes is a little different from the usual.

Commander: She looks pretty serious, you don't see that often. Don't tell me—

...Bang!

AN-94: AK-12 scores.

SPAS-12: B-but why?!

AK-12: SPAS-12, when this sort of thing happens, the point goes to the opposition.

SPAS-12: R-really?

SPAS-12 looks back to me, but all I can do is smile sadly and shrug.

As I thought... However motivated SPAS-12 is, she's going to lose out if she doesn't know the rules well enough.

Even so—

...Bang!

AN-94: SPAS-12 scores.

AK-12: Oh my...

SPAS-12: Humph! I already know what to do!

SPAS-12...is surprisingly strong.

Ah, no, it's not that surprising.

Now that I think about it, she really is suited for simple, rough physical labor.

It's not like she's stupid, but rather...

...Bang!

AN-94: AK-12 scores.

SPAS-12: Dammit...

SPAS-12...doesn't really want to give things too much thought.

She has a different approach to many things compared to most other T-Dolls.

...Bang!

What does she care about?

A name? A surfboard? Or a match?

She's always smiling, but the truth is...I don't really understand her...

...Bang!

AN-94: SPAS-12 scores.

AK-12: You seem quite serious. That's somewhat different from my initial impression of you.

SPAS-12: (Pants) And how much...do you know about me?

AK-12: You like eating.

...Bang!

AN-94: AK-12 scores.

AK-12: You're worried about your weight.

...Bang!

AN-94: AK-12 scores.

AK-12: So, am I right about those?

SPAS-12: Haha... Well, you're not wrong...

AK-12: What are you laughing about?

SPAS-12: Well...

...Bang!

AN-94: SPAS-12 scores.

SPAS-12: ...I'm glad that you know only so much about me.

AK-12: What else should I know, then?

SPAS-12: What you should know is...I've already got this game figured out.

Though it's the final set, SPAS-12 looks surprisingly relaxed.

AK-12: ..Oh?

SPAS-12: All you need...is brute force!

BANG!

...

AN-94: ...

SPAS-12: Er...

AK-12: Oh dear...

AK-12: What should we do? I didn't expect this at all...

Frankly speaking, it's not like I didn't see this coming...

SPAS-12: Commander...

SPAS-12: Who gets the point if you burst the ball?

AN-94: My neural cloud doesn't have anything about such a rule, but in theory... Where did it fall, anyway?

SPAS-12: But, but! If the ball hadn't burst, it would have fallen on your side, going by its path!

SPAS-12: That was my super move, you'd never have been able to stop it!

Why are you talking about super moves after just one game?!

Commander: S-say, the ball isn't entirely on our side, is it?

Commander: See? It's more like it's fallen in the middle!

AN-94: But...it already touched the net...

SPAS-12: That doesn't prove anything, the ball's corpse fell straight down!

Commander: (Great work, Sabrina!)

AN-94: In that case, we ought to see how much of the ball's carcass is on each side.

Commander: (Very good, that's the outcome we want!)

I catch SPAS-12's eye and tap my foot. She immediately gets the message.

Commander: Ah...Then why don't we take a break first before we calculate the area on both sides?

Commander: Oh, P38, you came too?

SPAS-12 surreptitiously sidles over. All she needs to do is stick out her foot to nudge the corpse of the ball to the other side.

Our plan will soon grant us victory...

P38: Hey, what's everyone arguing over? Let me be the judge!

Commander: Why did you come back?

P38: I thought...it would probably be more fun to come back and help you guys out...

AK-12: What do you think, Miss Witch?

P38: Hehe, it's obvious enough!

P38: You see that ball?

SPAS-12: Huh?

P38: There's more of it on our side, so doesn't that make us the winners?

...

In the end, we were a moment too slow, and thus we failed.

I guess karma just wouldn't let us cheat. I glance at SPAS-12 and she sticks her tongue out at me...in a way that only I can see.

At dusk, we sit on the beach for some rest before the bonfire is ready...

I see SPAS-12 discussing something with AK-12, and then she comes running back with her surfboard in hand.

Commander: What did you talk to AK-12 about?

SPAS-12: She was interested in my surfboard, so I let her check it out.

Commander: You really gave it to her?

SPAS-12: It couldn't be helped... We did lose, after all, and I saw no reason to refuse either...

SPAS-12 puts her surfboard aside and sits next to me.

SPAS-12: Besides, she just took a look at it.

Commander: That really was a quick look.

SPAS-12: Hmm... It looks like she didn't find anything special, so she returned it to me.

Commander: That surfboard...or rather, that shield... Is it very important to you?

SPAS-12: Sort of. It's just that it's been with me for a long time, but it won't be of much use in the future so I thought I'd modify it and bring it along on this trip.

Commander: Can you call that...thriftiness? What a surprise.

SPAS-12: Not really... I just don't like throwing old things away.

SPAS-12: If only my things...could stay with me forever...

Commander: So that you can step on them and grind their faces into the seawater?

SPAS-12: Meh, its better than taking bullets, right?

Commander: Indeed. No one can even tell it's a riot shield, right?

SPAS-12: No one except that AK-12. She stared at it for a long time the first time she saw it, but when I finally let her study it, she just looked for a few seconds before giving it back.

SPAS-12: Is it because I didn't modify it well enough? It felt like she was looking down on me.

Commander: No, no, she's curious about everything. It's just that her curiosity only lasts a few seconds.

SPAS-12: So you do know them.

Commander: I met them once during a previous operation. Whether that counts as knowing them... Well, I'm not too sure myself.

SPAS-12: Then don't just let them talk you into doing stuff that we're not good at.

Commander: You girls ought to encounter new things from time to time. It helps you to learn. Why, didn't you enjoy it?

SPAS-12: Alright, it was pretty fun... It was a proper workout...

Plop.

SPAS-12 leans back and sprawls on the sand.

SPAS-12: Although...it would've been better if we'd won...

Commander: Are you still bothered by the outcome of the match? I mean, you did very well for your first time.

SPAS-12: Hmm... Still, if I'd tried even harder, then maybe...

Commander: Sabrina...

Commander: Do you want to get serious?

SPAS: I don't know. I'm always lazy, and I'm happy with how things are now...

Commander: Well, I don't have an opinion about it either way, and work-wise...

SPAS-12: Although, Commander...

Commander: Hmm?

SPAS-12: Do you really like how I am now?

Commander: ...

I look down at SPAS-12, her expression completely obscured by the dark.

Commander: Can you be any different?

SPAS-12: Maybe I can... I don't know...

SPAS-12: Will you...need me to change in the future?

Commander: Well, if this is your top form, then there's no need to change, is there?

SPAS-12: That's true...

SPAS-12: My... How did the conversation end up like this?

SPAS-12 laughs, but it sounds hollow. Perhaps it's from her neural cloud, or her heart, or...

SPAS-12: I know! It must be because I'm hungry!

Commander: That takes you a whole process of deduction to figure out...?

SPAS-12: That's because my heart's more sensitive than my tummy! Take me to a burger place now, Commander! There must be one nearby!

Commander: Maybe not today, the reviews for that burger place are horrible. Besides, you ought to eat something healthy from time to time.

SPAS-12: How bad can a burger get! Besides, T-Dolls don't get blocked arteries from eating junk food, so it doesn't matter if I eat a little more!

Commander: You won't eat anything else?

SPAS-12: Hehe, my policy is to never eat food I don't like!

Commander: Goodness, what a fussy eater you are...

SPAS-12: Hehe, what's wrong with a T-Doll who's satisfied with junk food?

Commander: What about roast meat, then?

SPAS-12: Roast...meat?!

SPAS-12 bounces up with a sproing!

Commander: Once we get the bonfire going, we can start roasting it.

SPAS-12: Ehhh?! You never said anything about that!

Commander: That's because I didn't know if you liked it. I guess I should take you to the burger place after all.

...Just kidding. How could I not know?

SPAS-12: Then you obviously have much to learn about me!

SPAS-12: So that burger place has bad ratings, huh? Well, I've got more faith in your roasting skills, Commander! Hurry, hurry, let's get the fire started!

Commander: We'll begin once Ameli and P38 come back!

Commander: Hey, stop shaking me, Sabrinaaaaa~!

As SPAS-12 shakes me, I see Ameli and P38 coming back with their hands full of firewood. It seems that our conversation is about to come to an end... After all, SPAS-12 probably won't talk too much once we start roasting the meat.

In the end, I didn't manage to ask about the name "Sabrina"...

Still, it's not too bad. I've learned enough for today.

Besides, this is good too. No matter what implications the past or future hold for her, the present SPAS-12 is the girl before my eyes...

And I hope the present will last a long, long time...
