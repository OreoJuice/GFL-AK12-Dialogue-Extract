At the expo venue.

JS9 and T91 are going through a list of tasks to be completed.

JS9: In that case... I'll take care of organizing everyone.

JS9: That means I'll have to trouble you with the logistics side.

T91: Mm, don't worry, I'll make sure we get all the support we need.

T91: My job is to make sure everyone is fed and supplied.

JS9: Uh, that's not what I meant.

JS9: I'm not worried about that part at all; after all, you're very trustworthy, T91.

JS9: What worries me is...can you keep PA-15 under control?

T91: I see... I'll do my best.

PA-15: Oho? What are you talking about?

PA-15: What does she need to do her best in?

T91: Nothing whatsoever.

T91: How come you make no noise when you walk, PA-15?

PA-15: Ehhh...? But I just walked up normally to you.

PA-15: Or are you troubled by a guilty conscience, hm?

T91: A guilty conscience?

T91: It's not like I've done you wrong or anything, don't be ridiculous.

JS9: Let's leave the chatter aside for now.

JS9: You came just in time, PA-15.

JS9: T91 will manage the logistics resources with you.

JS9: Move our supplies to the temporary warehouse, then distribute our rations.

T91: Mm, got it.

T91: Work hard, PA-15.

T91: Do it for the Commander's sake.

PA-15: When you put it that way, I don't really have a choice, do I?

PA-15: So all I need to do is mind our stores, right? Sounds really simple and boring.

JS9: You won't know if it's simple or not until you try your hand at it.

JS9: I'll be heading off first; I still have a lot of things to do all over the place.

JS9: I trust this work should be well within your capabilities.

JS9: Do your best.

PA-15: I have the feeling she doesn't quite trust us.

PA-15: Could it be me? Does she not trust me?

T91: Alright, we should be going too, PA-15.

T91: We've got lots to do as well.

PA-15: Ooooh, playing deaf now, aren't we?

PA-15: Alright, I understand. In any case, I just need to do the job, right?

PA-15: We've sure done a lot.

PA-15: So, can I go now?

T91: ...We haven't even started yet, have we?

T91: Your motivation vanished way too fast.

T91: That's why we don't trust you.

PA-15: Aw, don't be so mad. I totally understand.

PA-15: I was just wondering.

T91: ...Look, I know you don't like this sort of work and find it boring.

T91: But work is work. Your personal preference is irrelevant.

T91: So please be responsible, alright?

PA-15: I know, I know.

PA-15: If I wasn't planning to do a good job, I'd have slipped away to have some fun already.

T91: You're too restless, PA-15.

PA-15: That's why I'm saying there must be something wrong with the person who gave us our assignments, right?

PA-15: Having me do this despite knowing how I am...

PA-15: I mean, ration resupply, fireworks... Anyone could do this. Why does it have to be me?

T91: That's because we're critically short-handed and have no choice.

T91: Now quit complaining, I'm going to distribute our rations.

T91: Be good and keep an eye on this place.

PA-15: Yes, yes.

PA-15: Alright, I got it.

PA-15: (Sighs)

T91: I'm not going to go soft on you just because you're deliberately sighing so loudly.

PA-15: You really are an annoying little devil, aren't you, T91?

T91: I never imagined the day would come when YOU would say that.

T91: I'm off, keep an eye on the place!

PA-15: Yes, ma'am— In any case, I just need to make sure this stuff doesn't get stolen, right?

T91: Well, you're not wrong.

T91: In any case, don't let anything happen to it.

T91: PA-15 should be fine, right...? I'm worried about her.

T91: It's odd though... When you think about it, PA-15 always completes her missions flawlessly whenever she's deployed.

T91: She hardly ever shirks her work either.

T91: But I just can't bring myself to trust her. I wonder why...

Though she feels a little uneasy, T91 doesn't have the time to worry about others right now.

She feels the weight of the big and small bags hanging off her hands, as well as the responsibility placed on her.

T91: Forget it, there's no point overthinking this.

T91: Since I've entrusted the matter to her, it's too late for me to worry about what's going to happen on her end.

T91: Rather, I should put my trust in her and just do my own job.

T91: Let's see, my first stop is...

Gr MG36: Just a little more over here... Alright, go ahead, HAL 9002.

Gr MG36: It might be hard to believe, but I must tell you the truth...

Gr MG36: I am your father.

HAL 9002?: ?

Gr MG36: Still doesn't have enough impact?

Gr MG36: Alright then, let me think about it again...

Gr MG36: Okay, one more time!

T91: Gr MG36 looks like she's in a good mood. But what's with that hamster?

T91: She looks like she's playing, but she's probably pretty busy, so I guess I shouldn't disturb her.

T91: I don't think the packaging team have started yet...huh?

T91: SPP-1 and PKP are already here? They sure are early...

T91: I didn't think the two of them would be so motivated.

PKP: ...

SPP-1: ...

PKP: You're early, SPP-1.

SPP-1: ...Yeah.

T91: For some reason, the mood in the air seems a little strange. Am I imagining things?

T91: They look like they're making preparations, so I probably shouldn't disturb them either.

T91: Hopefully they'll notice I've put their stuff over here...

A bubble tea store suddenly comes within T91's line of sight.

It seems to glow in her eyes, and the fragrance of the different flavors of bubble tea wafts out of the front door.

As a connoisseur of bubble tea, T91 knows it's of superior quality.

T91: ...

Milk Tea Store: ...

T91: No... I can't, I'm still working.

A delicious smell comes from the bubble tea store.

T91: ...

T91: Maybe just a little... That should be okay, right?

T91: Really just a little bit...and it's not alcoholic anyway...

T91: It...it won't interfere with my work!

T91: Ahhh— That is fantastic!

T91: The tea itself is really tasty, and even the pearls have just the right consistency.

T91: Looks like I found a pretty good place, I guess I'll try the other flavors next time I come here...

T91: ...Erk. Oh no, how long have I been gone?

T91: Ah, this is bad! I need to hurry up and head back!

T91 rushes back to the furniture expo and heads to the temporary warehouse.

T91: Come to think of it, I've left PA-15 alone for a long time. I feel bad for her.

T91: Maybe I'll give her some of my bubble tea... No, I'll take her to the store with me next time.

Feeling a slightly bit guilty, T91 walks up to the temporary warehouse and pushes the door open.

T91: PA-15, I'm back—

T91: —What the hell are you doing?!

PA-15: Oh, you're back, T91.

PA-15: What am I doing...? Isn't it obvious?

PA-15: I'm entertaining myself.

PA-15 is still sitting on her chair.

What's different now is that...

For some reason, PA-15 has tied a huge bundle of fireworks and firecrackers to the chair and she has the fuse in one hand...

And an open flame in the other. It looks like she's going to ignite the fuse.

T91: Alright, I get it.

T91: You can have all the bubble tea, please just calm down.

PA-15: Why are you being so polite to me all of a sudden?

PA-15: Is what I'm doing really dangerous or something?

T91: ...OF COURSE it is! Please, stop, I'm begging you!

T91: I only stepped out for a bit, how did things escalate so quickly?!

Granted, it wasn't just for a little while...

But when she thinks that all this might have happened because she wasted all that time at a bubble tea store, T91's head begins to ache.

PA-15: I see, so it IS pretty dangerous.

T91: ...Forget it, the important thing is that you understand.

Still with a pensive look on her face, PA-15 lights the fuse without any hesitation..

T91: NO!

T91: Why are you doing this?!

PA-15: Well, isn't it natural to want to do something when other people tell you it's dangerous?

T91: How is that natural...ah.

PA-15: Oh dear.

...

The burning fuse vanishes into the body of the fireworks. There is a moment of silence.

Then...

Snap! Crackle! Pop!

T91: Uwaaaahhhhh!

PA-15: Oho... This is a little...ahaha.

PA-15: Not just a little, it's SUPER exciting!

T91: Quit laughing! If you pile this many fireworks and light them all at once, they're going to explode—

As soon as she realizes that, T91's outstanding reflexes immediately spring into action.

She reaches behind herself and closes the door to the provisional warehouse.

Then...

—Boom!

...A scene of utter devastation.

PA-15: Ow ow ow... Hm, that WAS pretty dangerous after all.

T91: If...

PA-15: Ah?

T91: If you knew that, then you shouldn't have done it!

PA-15: Aw... Alright, I shouldn't have done that, don't be mad.

PA-15: You've got such a pretty face, it's already enough of a shame that it's all coated in soot and dust.

PA-15: Let's not make it worse by scrunching it up with that frown.

T91: And whose fault is it that my face is covered in soot?!

T91: Honestly... I'm so mad I don't even know what I should say.

T91: ...Oh.

PA-15: ...Hm?

T91: ...Doesn't this debris look a little familiar?

PA-15: That's my chair, right?

T91: You mean they USED TO BE your chair!

T91: Ah... This is terrible...

PA-15: Relax, relax...

T91: Why are YOU comforting me instead...?!

T91: You should be the one panicking now.

PA-15: That's why I'm sucking up to you.

T91: I just...

T91: I just don't know what to do with you...

PA-15: That bang just now was pretty loud. If we draw the other Dolls over, it'll only add to everyone's workload.

PA-15: Even if I say I want to take responsibility for it myself, they'll definitely try to pitch in.

T91: ...

T91: ...I'll help you divert their attention.

T91: During that time, make sure you clean everything up!

T91: Also! Make sure you piece that chair back together!

PA-15: For real? What a taskmaster.

T91: No ifs or buts!

PA-15: Fine, then I'll leave the other matter to you.

PA-15: Miss Accomplice.

T91: Shut up!

T91: If you say one more word, you can take care of everything by yourself!

T91 leaves the warehouse in a huff.

...When she thinks about how she's partially responsible for this as well, she just can't stand back and pretend to be an innocent bystander.

T91: I need to find a way to buy time...

T91: It would be one thing if the Dolls on the other teams found out, but if the Commander saw that mess...

A chill runs down T91's spine.

T91: Business is bad to begin with, but if word of this got out...

T91: The Commander would probably faint on the spot...

T91: In any case, let's try to turn the furniture expo around!

T91: Once things get busy, nobody will notice what's going on in the warehouse!

With that thought in mind, she spurs herself into motion and strides rapidly over to the main door.

T91 slowly approaches the exhibition hall's entrance, then takes a deep breath to perk herself up.

T91: I can't just give up like this.

T91: If I surrender now, the Commander will truly be disappointed in me.

T91: Griffin's motto is "Never surrender!"

T91: At most...I'll just join the reception team and help them out!

T91: That's right, that's what I'll do!

A commotion can be heard from beyond the main entrance.

T91: Hm?

T91: What's happening...? Are people making a fuss?

Amidst the clamor, more and more people are congregated just outside the expo venue, waiting to go in.

T91: Things got so lively all of a sudden...

T91: Looks like the reception team has succeeded in their task...

...

T91: ...In that case, the problem's been solved, hasn't it?

T91 breathes a sigh of relief.

T91: That should do.

T91: With this many visitors, not just the reception team, but everyone else is going to be busy.

T91: I hope PA-15 can tidy things up during this time...

As she watches the two Dolls throw themselves into their work, T91's anxiety gradually subsides, and she even finds herself humming a tune.

Now that she thinks about it... Why was she even so worried in the first place? She's not alone, after all.

All she has to do is give everyone a bubble tea.
