...

In the Repair Bay.

QBU-88: I'm...in the Repair Bay?

QBU-88: Why am I here...?

QBU-88: Oh, I showed M200 around the theater, then we ran into some mechs...

QBU-88's neural cloud starts churning as the relevant memories resurface.

QBU-88: H...Help!!

M200: Crap...

M200 puts down her camera and starts firing at the mech.

But her rushed attacks merely leave dents on its armor and cause no significant damage.

M200: No, this isn't something I can handle...

M200: Hailing Groza! Come in, Groza!!

M200: We've encountered numerous abandoned mechs in Theater No. 3, some of them still have intact firing modules, and they've captured QBU-88!

M200: I've sent you our coordinates... Please get here ASAP! Thank you very much!

QBU-88: Ugh... Arghhh...

M200: Oh no... Keeping it on edge only makes it tighten its grip...

QBU-88: It-it's leaving... Help! Where is it taking me?

M200: I'm going to shoot its joint again... Crap... I'm out of ammo!

M200: Are there really no other alternatives...?

OTs-14's Voice: I see it! M200, close your eyes!

QBU-88: Huh?

QBU-88: It felt as if I looked straight at the sun, then I passed out.

You have unread mail.

QBU-88: Unread mail? Is it an assignment? Let me see.

QBU-88: "...Prepare proper attire for the banquet..."

QBU-88: ...And I only have two days for this?! What the hell was the Commander thinking?! I haven't even paid for my repairs... Huh? The repair bill has been taken care of?

QBU-88: The payee was M200... Oh, it's her.

Having no time to ponder that any further, QBU-88 leaves the Repair Bay. She rubs her newly attached shoulder joint components as she walks back to her dorm.

She still hasn't fully recovered from the accident on the battlefield, now she is burdened with a new assignment.

QBU-88: I hope M200 isn't overthinking again, but I honestly can't spare the time to check on her right now...

QBU-88: Jeez, I know I'm capable, but the Commander is too much of a slave driver!

She keeps on griping, but she still makes her way to the dorm promptly.

As she expected, there is a pile of packages in front of her door.

QBU-88: (Sighs) What a pain.

QBU-88: Never mind, I'm the only one who can sort this out at such short notice.

QBU-88: I am an expert in this, after all.

She bends down and hauls all the packages into her room one after the other and begins the process of cutting out patterns.

QBU-88: The AR Team... The design for M4A1 should be kept simple and classy.

QBU-88: SOP-II is pretty quirky, so she should get a bold design.

QBU-88: RO's dress should reflect her understated elegance, and AR-15's dress could use some grunge elements... M16A1? Who's that?

QBU-88: Let me find her from the database... Oh, she looks really dependable. Black hair. Strong big-sis vibes. She'll be perfect in a chic maxi dress.

QBU-88: Next up is KSVK. Special remarks, "Tailor to her post-neural upgrade specifications. Details are as follows..." I see.

...

......

QBU-88: All done! In only 36 hours too...

QBU-88: Oh, I'm feeling a bit dizzy... Gotta charge myself...

She plugs herself to the charger and hums a tune while she writes a reply to the email. Then she waits for the logistics team to come and collect the finished dresses.

Knock knock.

Zas M76: Good afternoon. Is QBU-88 in?

Zas M76: I'm here on behalf of the Combined Services Department to collect the ordered dresses.

QBU-88: Yes, please enter. They may get wrinkled if you move them all by yourself. Why don't I come with you?

Zas M76: Thank you, but I can handle it on my own.

Zas M76: Oh... Is this for me?

QBU-88: Yes, I saw from your profile that this is your preferred style, so I made it with that in mind.

Zas M76: This is exquisite. I can't believe you can make such beautiful dresses.

Zas M76: Were the patterns prepared ahead of time?

QBU-88: Ahaha... Kind of?

QBU-88: It was still quite a rushed job though. It worked out well mostly thanks to the high-quality materials and lovely accessories that the Commander provided.

Zas M76: The silhouettes of your designs are really unique.

Zas M76: Being in motion of a graceful dance will further enhance a dress. Even though M1911's dress is as pretty as mine, I'm sure I'll still outshine her...

QBU-88: ...Is that really the point of the banquet?

Zas M76: Oh, I accidentally blurted out my thoughts.

Zas M76: The primary objective of organizing the banquet is to provide relaxation and entertainment, but that's not the point for me.

Zas M76: Actually, I think it's fair to say that everyone will be attending the banquet for different reasons.

QBU-88: Well, let me help you carry the dresses. That'll give you more time to practice your moves.

Zas M76: ...Alright, thanks.

QBU-88: Where were we?

QBU-88: Oh right, reasons for attending the banquet. Isn't there only one reason – social interaction?

Zas M76: The answer is obvious!

Zas M76: Some Dolls will be going to make new friends or to deepen existing friendships.

Zas M76: Some will be attending to dazzle others.

Zas M76: We spend most of our time fighting; this banquet will give us a chance to show off qualities other than our prowess in battle.

QBU-88: Deepen friendships, you say...?

Zas M76: As I was saying, we are instruments of war. Our identity as a Doll is secondary to our weapon...or more specifically, our fire output.

Zas M76: But at the banquet, we can be ourselves – the Doll will be at the forefront. So if you want to make new friends, this will be the perfect opportunity.

Zas M76: Put down your gun and meet someone else as a Doll. Show them the kind of Doll that you are.

QBU-88: In other words, the point of going to the banquet could be something more than just eating and drinking – like making new friends?

Zas M76: If you share that belief, then I look forward to meeting you at the banquet.

Zas M76: Still, I suppose we're already friends now, aren't we?

QBU-88: Yes, we are.

QBU-88: ...We're here.

Zas M76: Thanks for helping. It'd have taken me several trips to move all the dresses alone.

Zas M76: Now I have more time to rehearse!

QBU-88: Don't mention it.

...After bidding Zas M76 farewell, QBU-88 heads back to her dorm on her own.

She stares at the fabric scraps and discarded packaging scattered around her dorm and is suddenly overcome by a sense of restlessness.

QBU-88: Strange, I wasn't too interested in the banquet...

QBU-88: (But now... I feel kinda lonely.)

QBU-88: (The silence in the dorm feels heavy...)

QBU-88: (I don't like this feeling.)

Zas M76: We are instruments of war. Our identity as a Doll is secondary to our weapon...or more specifically, our fire output.

Zas M76: But at the banquet, we can be ourselves – the Doll will be at the forefront. So if you want to make new friends, this will be the perfect opportunity.

Zas M76: Put down your gun and meet someone else as a Doll. Show them the kind of Doll that you are.

QBU-88: I didn't think too much of it, but now I realize I'm feeling lonely, which is why I need to be more honest with myself...

QBU-88: ...I DO want to attend the banquet, and I don't want to go alone.

QBU-88: If I invite M200 along...

QBU-88: ...She'll definitely say no, and she'll use the lack of proper attire as an excuse! I'm having none of that!

QBU-88 picks up another roll of fabric while picturing M200's frail figure facing off the mechs in her mind.

Her uniform was stained and tattered in the brutal fight, a far cry from her usual tidy self.

QBU-88: ...Five hours until the deadline.

QBU-88 contemplates the girl who fought to protect her in spite of her incredulity of war...and takes up her needle and thread.

Ring, ring, ring!

Five hours later, the alarm she has set goes off.

She puts down her needle and beholds the two evening dresses displayed side-by-side with great satisfaction.

QBU-88: I had the designs beforehand, but still, kudos to me for making two dresses out of the remaining fabric in such a short amount of time!

She scoops up the dresses and calls M200 as she runs toward her dorm.

M200: Hm? Hello, M200 speaking.

QBU-88: M200, come to the banquet with me!

M200: ..."Banquet"?

QBU-88: I've sewn a dress for you. Try it on!

M200: But...

QBU-88: I'm outside your door already. Open up!
