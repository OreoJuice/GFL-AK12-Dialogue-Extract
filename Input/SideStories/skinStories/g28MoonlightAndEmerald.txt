...

???: Still struggling?

???: If you have an ace-in-the-hole to play, by all means, play it.

Gr G28: Ugh...

???: If not, then you should just give up.

???: The final throes of your defeat are of no interest to me.

Gr G28: You were just lucky!

Gr G28: N-Next time... I'll definitely...!

???: While there's a saying that goes "luck is the whole of your strength", are you truly that naive to truly believe that?

???: Still, you're a Griffin Doll, so it's only expected that some of you would think in such a way.

Gr G28: Ugh...

...

Gr G28: Honestly...

Gr G28: How did things end up like this?!

...

...Half an hour ago.

Gr G28: Huh?

Gr G28: This isn't what we agreed on, Commander!

Gr G28: Back in the base, didn't you say that the only thing we had to do was eat?

Commander: Er...that was the original plan, yes.

Commander: However, something came up at the last minute, so please lend me a hand.

Gr G28: And you were saying that this was a banquet sponsored by food suppliers so we could relax and all... you're a big fat liar, Commander.

Commander: The best laid plans of mice and men and all that. It's really hard on me too...

Gr G28: What on earth is going on? How is it that you couldn't anticipate it, Commander?

Commander: Explaining this part is going to be a little tricky...

Commander: Think of it as a bunch of troublemakers taking the opportunity to observe Griffin...or to be precise, what you're made of.

Gr G28: Hah? Shouldn't you just beat them up and throw them out? ...I'm just kidding.

Commander: I wasn't going to take it seriously.

Commander: After all, there's no telling who'd get thrown out if it actually came to a fight...

Gr G28: Who are these people?

Gr G28: Are they Dolls too?

Commander: Explaining this part is also going to be a little tricky...

Commander: All you need to know is that one of them is called AK-12 and the other is called AN-94.

Gr G28: Why is explaining everything so tricky?

Gr G28: You're not trying to pull a fast one over me, are you?

Commander: The less you know about the two of them, the better. That's the truth.

Gr G28: But I remember those names...

Gr G28: The people who came back from the beach last time said that they encountered some weird Dolls.

Commander: ...Much as I hate to admit it, they are, in fact, the same duo from back then.

Gr G28: Why does it sound like they keep showing up when we're having fun...

Commander: (Yeah, why is that... all I can say is that it was a good thing I arranged for insurance beforehand this time round...)

Commander: It doesn't matter why they're here. The important thing is that they finally picked something to do where nobody's going to get hurt!

Gr G28: That sounds terrible...

Commander: So... are you any good at Texas Hold 'Em?

Commander: If not, I'll just have to find someone else.

Gr G28: I've never played it before...but since you asked me first, how could I pass up this chance to others?

Gr G28: Will you reward me if I win, Commander?

Commander: Ah...

Commander: About that...we can carefully explore the details of each and every possibility.

Gr G28: It's a deal, then. If I win...

Gr G28: ...

Commander: Huh? Why are you covering your face all of a sudden?

Commander: Also, please don't pluck the flowers in the venue.

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: There are some things you shouldn't make a girl say!

Commander: Ahem, we can carefully explore the details of each and every possibility.

Gr G28: We're going to explore them, all right.

Gr G28: It's just a game of cards! Watch me master it!

Commander: I suppose having such confidence is a good thing.

Commander: ...

Commander: Oh yes, Gr G28...if you need an extra helper, she's over...

Gr G28: Huh? What? Who?

Commander: ...

Commander: No, it's nothing. Pretend that I never said anything.

Commander: Just think of it as I believe in you to the point where I think of assistance as unnecessary.

Gr G28: Hm?

Gr G28: Well, if you say so, Commander. I'll go and prepare now!

Commander: ...

Commander: If they really end up meeting...she'll probably find out on her own...

...

AK-12: What's the matter? It's your turn again.

AK-12: I hope you don't disappoint me, considering you said you'd turn the tables next time.

Gr G28: (Whimpers)

Gr G28: I... I'll check.

AK-12: Don't mind if I do, then.

AK-12: I raise 1000.

AN-94: I call.

Gr G28: 1000?!

Gr G28: (That's...more chips than I have on hand...)

Gr G28: (Is K2 our only hope for this round?)

K2: ...I fold.

Gr G28: (Huh?)

AK-12: You're the only one left, my adorable green-haired devochka in the white dress.

AK-12: Do you want to call or raise...but you can't do anything besides fold or go all in, can you?

Gr G28: Don't call me a green-haired little girl! I've got a name of my own, you know!

Gr G28: (What should I do... I can only make three nines with the cards I have on hand... Should I play along?)

Gr G28: (But if I lose...all my chips will be gone!)

...

Gr G28: I... I fold.

AK-12: Giving up so soon? How boring.

AK-12: Show your hand, AN-94.

AN-94: A pair of 9s.

AK-12: I only have a pair of 5s.

AK-12: You win this round, AN-94.

Gr G28: So the two of you...only had a pair each?

Gr G28: Then if I hadn't folded just now...

AK-12: If you had been willing to bet everything you had, you would have won this round.

AK-12: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. That's perfectly normal, isn't it?

Gr G28: ...You're cruel!

Gr G28: You leverage on your huge stack of chips and place huge bets every round, how are we supposed to fight back against that?

AK-12: Isn't it only natural to make full use of any advantage you have?

AK-12: It doesn't matter to me one bit that you have no assets worth fighting for on the table.

K2: Ughh... If only MDR hadn't messed up the game earlier...

Gr G28: The worst part is that she spoiled the game and ran off, leaving us with a huge mess to clean up.

Gr G28: Honestly...how can we end up losing to them because of this!

K2: But now we have no choice.

K2: Even if we don't count the round where MDR cheated, M99 was forced to retire in the end.

K2: And now the stakes have risen again...we'll probably dig ourselves further into the hole if it's just the two of us...

Gr G28: Should we cheat too?

K2: How could we?! What are you thinking!

Gr G28: (Groans) The Commander must've thought up a lavish reward for us, how could we be such disappointments?!

K2: If only we could find another person, we might have a chance...

K2: But where are we going to find someone who's willing to stand up against those two...

Gr G28: Watch me. We've got lots of people here tonight, so surely we'll be able to find someone.

Gr G28: You two don't mind, right?

AK-12: Not at all.

AN-94: The difference between us is such that it doesn't matter who Griffin adds.

Gr G28: Hmph! Just you wait!

Gr G28: Urgh...

Gr G28: After ruling out the kids, the ones you can't communicate with, and the sarcastic ones...

Gr G28: There really isn't anyone left!

Gr G28: Why wasn't Springfield here for this...

Gr G28: ...

Commander: Oh yes, Gr G28... if you need an extra helper, she's over...

Gr G28: Huh? What? Who?

Commander: ...

Commander: No, it's nothing. Pretend that I never said anything.

Commander: Just think of it as I believe in you to the point where I think of assistance as unnecessary.

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Ahhhhhh!

Gr G28: Why didn't you finish your sentence back then, Commander!

Gr G28: You big dummy!

Click...

K2: Miss Gr G28...we should just give up if you can't find anyone...

K2: I secretly asked Miss Sabrina about AK-12 and AN-94 just now, and she says that they're in a completely different league from us.

K2: So it's perfectly reasonable that we can't beat them...

Gr G28: Admitting defeat before you start is the same as being defeated!

Gr G28: You need to fight until the end with whatever cards you have on hand, that's the way to win Texas Hold 'Em.

K2: Ah...she's gotten into it now...

Gr G28: I'll make sure I come back with someone amazing!

Gr G28: And then we'll turn everything around together!

...

Gr G28: That said...there's nobody who can help us at all...

...Gr G28 paces around inside the venue and eventually ends up leaning on a nearby wall.

Gr G28: If I go back like this, K2 and I are going to lose all our chips...

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Ahhhh, I don't care anymore...anyone will do as long as they can work with us!

Click...

Gr G28 activates the Imprint Recognition System.

Gr G28: I need a Doll whose Imprint is similar to mine...even if it's just a little...

Gr G28: But in a place like this...

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Huh?

...

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Excuse me...

???: ...Is something the matter?

Gr G28: Please allow me to apologize if I have disturbed you in any way.

Gr G28: It's like this...I have an unreasonable request to make...

???: If you know it's unreasonable, why even bother making it?

Gr G28: We...need your help.

Gr G28: It also counts as a request from the Commander—

???: So what if the Commander needs help? What does that have to do with me?

Gr G28: But—

AK-12: Are you happy to just stand by and watch?

AK-12: It's not often that you get a chance to put your gun down. Why not take full advantage of it?

???: ...

Gr G28: Huh?

Gr G28: Do the two of you...know each other?

???: We don't.

AK-12: ...Yes, we don't.

AK-12: And the truth is, there's no need for us to know each other, is there?

???: What are you trying to say, AK-12?

???: The way you abandoned the person you ought to be watching and popped up in a place like this tells me that you haven't changed at all.

AK-12: Strenuous work is bad for both humans and Dolls.

AK-12: Hasn't what we've done given you a chance to catch a breather as well?

Gr G28: (Huh? Didn't the two of them say they didn't know each other just now?)

???: A mission is a mission.

AK-12: Since it's all a mission, then wouldn't it be better to get a little closer?

AK-12: Being able to bring back some bonus observations would make things easier on your end too, no?

???: ...

Gr G28: Ladies... I sincerely apologize for any awkwardness which my actions may have caused.

Gr G28: Fräulein AK-12, let's head back. Fräulein AN-94 and Fräulein K2 are waiting for us.

Gr G28: As for the extra person, we'll...

AK-12: Don't worry, we've found her.

AK-12: This "stranger" is going to take good care of her sister and defeat AN-94 and myself, isn't that right?

???: ...That's enough, AK-12.

???: I'm not interested in your lame little jokes.

...At the card table.

K2: ...

Gr G28: ...

AN-94: I previously said that it did not matter which Griffin Doll came over. Allow me to take those words back.

???: Cut the crap.

AK-12: So we're starting at 20000 chips?

AK-12: Then let's continue. Deal.

K2: Gr G28...who's this?

Gr G28: I don't know... She didn't want to come at first, but after AK-12 whispered something into her ear...

Gr G28: She feels really familiar to me, but I just can't remember anything about her...

K2: Huh? But if you don't even know who she is, then how did you meet her?

Gr G28: Our Imprints are very similar.

Gr G28: I want to say that she's a Doll whose neural cloud is related to mine, so...

K2: Is...is this alright?

Gr G28: I don't know... She wouldn't even tell me her name...

AK-12: When it comes to forms of address, you can call her "HKM—"

...Gr G28 hears the person beside her taking a deep breath.

Gr G28: Uh...can I call you "Miss Edelweiss"?

Gr G28: Your dress is very pretty...so...

???: ...I don't give a damn.

AK-12: "Miss 4" would work too, if she doesn't mind.

Miss Edelweiss: Drop dead, AK-12.

Miss Edelweiss: All in.

AK-12: You're betting all your chips with only three cards showing? Finally, something interesting.

K2: Gr G28... I have the feeling we've gotten involved in some kind of incredible conflict...

Gr G28: I think so too...

...

Gr G28: Hmm...although having Miss Edelweiss around kept the game from becoming a one-sided slaughter...

Gr G28: If we keep losing money as quickly as she wins it...there's no way we can beat the two of them...

K2: I'm out of chips again...

K2: I guess we can only watch the gods fight from the side, huh?

Gr G28: We can't do that!

Gr G28: If you mean we can't collect our reward from the Commander AND have to perform on stage, then I don't want to do that.

K2: Then what should we do...

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: ...Miss Edelweiss?

...

Gr G28: Miss Edelweiss, I have something to ask you...

Miss Edelweiss: What is it?

Miss Edelweiss: Why are you using a comm channel at the table? Don't you have a mouth?

Gr G28: Miss Edelweiss, it isn't just because of luck that those two Dolls keep winning, right?

Miss Edelweiss: Do you actually believe that nonsense the Commander was saying about "luck being the whole of your strength"?

Gr G28: As if.

Gr G28: But as representatives of Griffin in this game, we don't want to lose, so we want to know what to do.

K2: ...

Miss Edelweiss: There's nothing you can do. This game relies on calculating probabilities by counting cards and having a firm grasp of your opponent's situation.

Miss Edelweiss: In terms of calculation accuracy and processing speed, the two of you never stood a chance to begin with.

K2: If it's just calculations...I won't lose!

Miss Edelweiss: Nobody asked you.

Gr G28: AN-94 just raised her bet by 5000, why is that?

Miss Edelweiss: She's got a good hand. Don't call.

Miss Edelweiss: AN-94 has no facial expressions, but she hasn't learned how to lie, and she follows AK-12 in everything.

Miss Edelweiss: She only takes action when AK-12's hole cards have no chance of winning.

K2: Huh? Why didn't you say that earlier—

Miss Edelweiss: There is no need for me to take responsibility for your idiocy.

K2: Damn...she's cold...

Gr G28: That's amazing...you just sat down but you already saw so many things...

Miss Edelweiss: It's just experience.

Miss Edelweiss: Compared to AN-94, if AK-12 immediately raises the stakes in the first round, the odds that she's bluffing are 85%. Go think about it yourself.

Gr G28: Understood. Danke, Miss Edelweiss.

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Miss Edelweiss, I have a 4 of Diamonds and a 7 of Hearts.

Miss Edelweiss: ...

K2: Gr G28, that's cheating!

Gr G28: So what!

Gr G28: Odds are, the Dolls on the other side are already cheating, so we need to even the playing field!

Miss Edelweiss: Don't push it.

Gr G28: ...Okay.

...

AK-12: This is the last round, so isn't it about time we settled things once and for all?

AK-12: Right now, the people with the fewest chips are...the adorable little green-haired girl in the white dress and her good friend, Miss Sweet Tooth.

Gr G28: Ughh...

AK-12: Now that you mention it, neither of you has gone all-in tonight. Why not give it a try right at the end?

AK-12: Maybe that might turn things around.

K2: We won't fall for that!

AK-12: Very good. I'm starting to look forward to the final result.

AK-12: Then let's begin the final round.

...

Gr G28: Haha...the cards I drew at the end are...a 2 of Spades and an 8 of Spades...

Gr G28: (Why did it have to be these two numbers...)

Gr G28: (If these are my last two cards...then there's no chance of me turning the tables!)

AN-94: Flop.

Three cards are revealed in order.

A 4 of Hearts.

A 4 of Hearts and a 9 of Spades.

A 4 of Hearts, a 9 of Spades and a Jack of Spades.

K2: Hehe... I've got a pair of Jacks on hand, I'm bound to win the final set!

Gr G28: (As I thought... there's no hope for me after all...)

AK-12: I'll raise by 7000.

K2: Eh?

K2: Ehhhhhh—?

AN-94: I fold.

Miss Edelweiss: I call.

Gr G28: (She doesn't even care about K2's Jacks...that must mean she has a hole card that can win...)

K2: I...fold.

Gr G28: (Maybe I should fold too...)

Miss Edelweiss: Why are you hesitating, Gr G28?

Gr G28: (Even Miss Edelweiss is urging me to fold...)

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: (Nein, that's not right...)

Gr G28: ("If AK-12 immediately raises the stakes in the first round, the odds that she's bluffing are—")

Gr G28: I call.

AK-12: Oh?

AN-94: Flop.

The 4th card is flipped up.

...It is a Queen of Spades.

This makes a 4 of Hearts, a 9 of Spades, a Jack of Spades and a Queen of Spades.

Gr G28: (Is this...a straight flush?)

AK-12: ...I'll raise by 8000.

Miss Edelweiss: I call.

Gr G28: I... I...

Miss Edelweiss: It's nothing.

Gr G28: (I knew it!)

Gr G28: I call.

AK-12: ...

Gr G28: (This is the 4th card, if the last one is a 10 of Spades...)

AN-94: We'll open the river, this is the last card.

And the fifth card—

Is a 10 of Spades.

That makes a 4 of Hearts, a 9 of Spades, a 10 of Spades, a Jack of Spades and a Queen of Spades.

Gr G28: ...ARGHHHH!

AK-12: ...Pffft.

AK-12: Cards like these are very suitable for a showdown.

AK-12: Let me guess, given that you've hung in there until the very end, that means you've got four to five cards of the same suit.

AK-12: Or perhaps...a straight flush?

Gr G28: So what about it? Are you going to admit I won?

AK-12: Then I'll level with you. I have a King of Spades in the hole.

Gr G28: That's...a bigger flush than mine...

Gr G28: Ugh...

AK-12: I'm going all in, devochka in the white dress...and Miss Edelweiss.

Miss Edelweiss: I fold.

Gr G28: Huh? Even Miss Edelweiss is—

AK-12: It's down to the two of us.

AK-12: If you think your odds are better than those of Miss Edelweiss, then go ahead and bet.

AK-12: What happens tonight is up to you, devochka.

Gr G28: (What should I do...? It took so long for me to get into a situation like this...)

Gr G28: (But if even Miss Edelweiss is folding...then what chance do I have...?)

Gr G28: I...I fo—

Click.

Miss Edelweiss: She's bluffing.

Gr G28: ...Huh?

K2: But we don't know what cards AK-12 has... How can we tell—

Miss Edelweiss: Don't make me repeat myself.

Miss Edelweiss: She's bluffing, Gr G28.

Miss Edelweiss: That's because—

Miss Edelweiss: The King of Spades was in the hand that I discarded.

Gr G28: W-wait a minute!

Miss Edelweiss: ...Why are you leaving the hall to look for me at a time like this?

Miss Edelweiss: Your friend's still on stage, isn't she?

Gr G28: I don't get it, Miss Edelweiss...

Gr G28: You could have won if you had kept that card!

Miss Edelweiss: There's no why to it. I discarded it because I felt like it.

Miss Edelweiss: Putting your friend on the bottom was just an unexpected consequence.

Gr G28: But AK-12 was bluffing that she had the card. If you had chosen not to fold back then—

Miss Edelweiss: Then it would have been simply because AK-12 guessed that I would fold.

Miss Edelweiss: And that's the end of the matter.

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Are you going back?

Miss Edelweiss: I've done what I came to do.

Miss Edelweiss: According to what she said, the time for relaxation should be over now.

Gr G28: Before you go...could you please hear me out one last time?

Miss Edelweiss: ...Make it snappy.

Gr G28: While I don't know why I can't remember if I've ever seen you before...you feel very familiar to me, Miss Edelweiss...

Gr G28: I don't know why, but I keep thinking of my stubborn big sister...

Gr G28: Ah, I'm not saying you're stubborn or anything, Miss Edelweiss!

Gr G28: And you're much prettier than my memories of her in my neural cloud!

Miss Edelweiss: I will take that as a compliment for the time being.

Miss Edelweiss: ...

Miss Edelweiss: Where's your big sister, then?

Gr G28: I don't know either...

Gr G28: One day, a long time ago, she suddenly said that she needed to carry out a very important mission, and she never came back to the base again.

Gr G28: Maybe she's still being a Tactical Doll somewhere out there... I think.

Miss Edelweiss: Is that all you remember?

Gr G28: Mm...it sounds strange. I'm clearly a Doll, but when I think back about her, it feels like I've gotten amnesia.

Gr G28: Even when I want to find out where she went, I can't find her in the archives or the neural cloud records.

Miss Edelweiss: That's good.

Gr G28: That's not good!

Gr G28: If I hadn't met you by chance here tonight, I feel like I could have forgotten that I even had a sister.

Miss Edelweiss: Do you miss her?

Miss Edelweiss: She might have hurt you in many immature ways, and yet you still miss the idealized image of her in your imagination.

Gr G28: If all that's left of her are good memories, then doesn't that mean the time I spent with my sister were good times?

Miss Edelweiss: You should keep that to yourself. It's not up to me to supply my opinion.

Gr G28: ...

Gr G28: Miss Edelweiss.

Miss Edelweiss: You said "one last time".

Gr G28: If, in the future...

Gr G28: You happen to run into someone who looks like my big sister, or a stubborn Doll whose Imprint is similar to ours, could you pass on a message?

Miss Edelweiss: ...

Miss Edelweiss: What message?

Gr G28: Nein...it's fine. Forget I asked.

Gr G28: Just take it that neither of us will ever meet her again.

Gr G28: Maybe that's best for all of us.

Miss Edelweiss: Then I'll take that as an "I'm doing fine, I hope you are too."

Miss Edelweiss: I'll tell her that if I run into her.

...

Commander: Gr G28?

Commander: Are you alright? Why are you standing here by yourself?

Commander: Don't be that way just because you lost a card game, it's scary.

Gr G28: Commander?

Gr G28: Oh...that's right...

Gr G28: I didn't win in the end...so there's no reward for me.

Commander: Who says that you need to come in first in order to get a reward?

Commander: Ahem...the proposals I researched aren't that limited!

Commander: There's a few that I'd like to recommend to you too, want to hear them?

Gr G28: Mm...never mind.

Commander: Huh?

Commander: I thought you'd want me to praise your dress tonight or something...

Gr G28: I don't need that anymore.

Gr G28: But in exchange, could you tell me some things about the past?

Commander: I might have to make things up if my memory's unclear, you know.

Gr G28: That's fine too. I just want to know a little more about what I didn't know before.

Commander: So what do you want to know?

Commander: I can tell you anything that isn't classified.

Gr G28: Commander, do you know a Doll called "Miss HKM" and "Miss 4"?

Commander: HKM...4?

Commander: 416?

Commander: ...

Commander: Ah...

Commander: Ah! I know nothing! I don't know anything.

...Gr G28 plucks a flower from a nearby shrub and hides her expression with it.

Gr G28: If you don't know, then never mind.

Gr G28: But at least...knowing that someone remembers her is enough for me.
