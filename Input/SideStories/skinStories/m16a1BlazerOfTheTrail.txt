...

The gunshots that have been resounding over the empty field finally stop. Once the echo fades away, the battlefield is once again silent.

M16A1 puts down her weapon and looks toward Groza.

Groza gestures at M16A1 that all is clear.

M16A1: This has dragged on for longer than I thought.

OTs-14: Who would've thought this would take days? I didn't expect we'd have to run so far after these mechs.

M16 follows Groza's gaze and looks back in the direction of the base.

OTs-14: Good thing we had informed the Commander before we set off, but by now...the party has probably started without us.

M16A1: Were you looking forward to the party?

OTs-14: Sure. Everyone having fun eating, chatting, and enjoying the peace and quiet...

OTs-14: Doesn't that beat firing a gun?

M16A1: You're right. I hope they have booze at the party... Come. If we hurry, we might still make it before they wrap things up.

M16A1: M16A1 hailing HQ. Mission accomplished. There is quite some distance between us and the base. Requesting a chopper for pickup at Heliport 9 in Theater No. 3.

Kalina: Copy that. We'll be there in no time~

M16A1: Thanks.

Kalina's jovial tone has helped M16A1 relax a little.

Other than herself and Groza, nothing else moves on the battlefield. She closes her eyes and slowly tries to unwind from the tension of the previous battle.

OTs-14: The chopper is here. Let's go.

The two Dolls embark on the journey home amidst the sound of the helicopter's rotary blades.

M16A1: The banquet is most probably already in full swing. RO is hopefully keeping a tight leash on SOP-II so that she stays out of trouble. AR-15 would be enjoying herself.

M16A1: What about M4? What could she be doing?

M16A1: Is she also having a good time? Or...

M16A1: ...Oh crap.

OTs-14: Hm? What's wrong?

M16A1: I...promised M4 I'd attend the banquet with her. She even said she had a surprise for me.

Groza checks the time and falls silent.

OTs-14: Uh, sorry.

M16A1: We're colleagues. I don't blame you.

OTs-14: But breaking a promise with your family is a grave offense.

M16A1: So...

OTs-14: I will bring flowers to your grave tomorrow.

M16A1: Be serious, don't you have any proper advice for me?

M16A1: I don't want to show up at the banquet in my battle gear, but nothing else would save me from M4's attacks.

OTs-14: Like I said, I will bring flowers to your grave tomorrow.

M16A1: Then I'll crawl out of hell and grab you by the ankle.

OTs-14: Right, enough jokes.

OTs-14: Since you'll inevitably be late, why don't you get her a gift to apologize?

M16A1: That could work... I'll see what I can do.

M16A1 lets out a long sigh.

Groza chuckles and pats her on the shoulder.

OTs-14: We're home.

Kalina: Welcome back, Groza and M16!

Kalina: The banquet is almost over, please put on the evening dresses that the Commander has prepared for you before you make your entrance~

M16A1: This dress?

M16A1: Doesn't my white hair clash with the black?

OTs-14: The design must have been based on your ID picture in the Griffin staff roster. It does look a bit odd on you now.

M16A1: But I can't not go. If we dye it white...

OTs-14: There's no time for that.

OTs-14: Hold on... We can't dye the dress white, but here's a perfect surprise for M4, don't you see?

M16A1: You mean...

OTs-14: It's a lot easier for Dolls to change our hair color.

Groza winks at M16.

M16 understands immediately. She enters the dressing room with the dress thoughtfully.

Half an hour later, at the banquet venue.

The banquet is already near its end. M16A1 and Groza slip in quietly through the side door. She scans the hall, looking for the Doll that has been on her mind.

SOP-II: M16!

M16A1: SOP-II, what are you doing here?

SOP-II: Where are you going?

M16A1: Uh... I was just grabbing something for M4.

SOP-II doesn't seem to have noticed that she was late.

M16A1 sighs inwardly in relief as she turns away.

SOP-II: ...Don't go.

M16A1: What?

M16 suddenly feels a strong grip around her waist.

SOP-II has thrown her arms tightly around M16 and lifts her right up.

M16A1: What the hell?!

After the initial shock, M16 is amused by her friend's erratic behavior.

The truth is revealed by the sharp smell of liquor coming from SOP-II – she is utterly smashed.

M16 can even tell from the faint cherry scent that SOP-II is probably drunk on cherry brandy.

M16A1: SOP-II, what are you doing?

M4A1: SOP-II what are you doing?!

SOP-II: I won't let you— Huh? You're back...

Just as M16 is feeling puzzled, SOP-II suddenly chomps on a green cookie and runs off.

M4A1: SOP-II!

M4A1: Uh, there's no catching her.

M16A1: Don't worry M4. Someone will stop her.

M16A1 gives M4A1 a reassuring pat on the shoulder. M4 looks up and glares at her.

Her delicate brow is furrowed, and her gentle eyes are now shooting daggers at her. M16 realizes that her little sister is about to unleash her wrath.

M16A1: Good evening, you look absolutely ravishing in this dress.

M4A1: Thank you.

M16A1: ... What a curt response. She must be livid.

M16A1: I can explain. Will you let me?

M4A1: ...

Much to M16A1's surprise, M4 does not start barraging her with what she has done wrong.

M16A1 stares at her and finds her old self reflected in M4's eyes.

It's as though nothing had ever changed, but they both know perfectly well that they have come a long way. There is no going back, nor should there be.

M16A1: ...M4?

M4A1: It...it feels as if I hadn't seen you in ages.

M4A1: But I saw you just days ago, didn't I?

M16A1: Ah...haha.

M16A1: I suppose you find this more familiar?

M4A1: It sure brings back memories.

M16A1: So you're not angry anymore?

M4A1: If you bring it up again, I'll lecture you for being late.

Soft dance music starts playing.

M16 offers a hand to M4 and bats her eyelashes at her.

M16A1: See, I'm not that late, after all.

M16A1: Shall we dance?

M4A1: Certainly.

M4 takes her hand and the two Dolls glide onto the dance floor.

When the song is over, M4 spins away and M16 extends her hand to AR-15.

ST AR-15: Is this an invitation?

M16A1: It's been a while.

Twirls and pivots. Skirts flutter and fall.

M16A1 shares a dance with every member of the AR Team before finally offering her hand to the Commander.

M16A1: Come, Commander.

M16A1: Let's celebrate our reunion. Will you also join me for a drink later?

Commander: ...

M16A1: Why do you hesitate? We hardly have to stand on ceremony with each other.

But she grasps the Commander's hand without waiting for an answer and they flow onto the dance floor when a new song starts playing.

M16A1: Still, I never imagined I would see you again under these circumstances, let alone dance with you.

M16A1: I'm quite a good dancer, aren't I?

M16A1: I'm not sure how you usually dance with the other Dolls, but I only know the men's steps, so bear with me.

She leads the Commander into the center of the dance floor. The spotlight shines on her tender smile.

M16A1: I'm very glad that we get to fight side-by-side in wartime and share a dance together in peacetime.

The song comes to an end. M16 lets go of the Commander and strolls casually away from the dance floor.

M16A1: Why aren't you dancing?

OTs-14: I quite enjoy watching here.

M16A1: How about a dance with me?

OTs-14: No, thank you. I'm content just being a bystander.

M16A1 doesn't force the issue. Instead, she leans against the wall and joins Groza in watching the others dance.

M16A1: What are you looking at?

OTs-14: What do you see?

M16A1: I see peace and happiness. You?

OTs-14: Something along that line.

M16A1: We should be seeing different things.

M16A1: We have different analytical modules, different character presets, different experiences...

OTs-14: True, but there are things that we both share.

OTs-14: Dancing happily with friends and family, eating delicious snacks, drinking good wine.

OTs-14: Just watching them is enough proof that all the fighting we've done was worthwhile, don't you agree?

M16A1: You're quite empathetic.

OTs-14: It's what makes me a team leader.

M16A1: But you're right... What else could matter more than peace and the smiles of those you care about?

M16A1: I would gladly suffer anything for the sake of protecting them.

OTs-14: Though a little more self-preservation would do you good.

OTs-14: Still, it's rather unlike you to be so sentimental. Aren't tactics all you ever talk about?

M16A1: I think you've confused me with AR-15.

The two Dolls burst out laughing.

M16A1: To peace.

OTs-14: To peace.

Clink. They clink glasses lightly and drain the contents.

Kalina: Now, may I have everyone's attention, please?

Kalina: Did you have fun tonight?

T-Dolls: Yes!

Kalina: Then let's begin the final activity for our celebration – a photography exhibition just for tonight!

Kalina: Our photographers KSVK and M200 have documented many special moments throughout this event with their camera lenses, from preparation to present! Will you be able to spot yourselves in the photos?

Kalina: While you admire their work, don't forget to vote for your favorite picture~

OTs-14: What an interesting activity they've come up with.

M16A1: ...

OTs-14: M16?

M16A1: There's a photo that I want to keep. I'm going to ask for a copy!

Before Groza can react, M16 rushes to locate the photographer who took that picture – KSVK.

She seems to have just come in from outside the venue. M16 strides over quickly and intercepts her.

KSVK: M16...?

M16A1: May I have a copy of the AR Team's photo?

KSVK: Sure, such precious memories are meant to be shared.

KSVK: I'm sure they'll also agree?

M16A1: ...

M16 turns around and finds the other four members of the AR Team standing behind her.

The five Dolls stare at each other wordlessly. ST AR-15 looks away while the rest of them and KSVK are all smiles.

KSVK: Right, since everyone is here, let's take a group photo.

ST AR-15: I...

SOP-II: Yay!

After a moment of shuffling, the five Dolls of the AR Team finally find their respective positions.

M16A1 has her arm around M4's shoulders. She seems almost stunned as she finds herself sandwiched among her old friends.

M16A1: M4 was right. It's almost like a dream to be here again with everyone...

M16A1: Yeah, I would gladly pay the price, whatever it may be, just to have more moments like this...

KSVK: Good. Now one, two—

KSVK's voice drags M16A1 back to the present. She looks straight at the camera and smiles genuinely from the heart.

M16A1: Three.
