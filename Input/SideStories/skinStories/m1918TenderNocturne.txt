In front of the event hall on the day before the anniversary...

Commander: I should speak with M1918 about this first...

M1918: Commander?

A voice calls out in front of me. Raising my head, I see M1918 standing there with her head tilted slightly and her eyes half-closed.

Commander: Ah, perfect timing, M1918. I have something I want to discuss with you.

Commander: By the way, are you heading to the event hall?

M1918 nods with a puzzled look on her face.

Commander: Well, SR-3MP went and changed the decorations in the event hall...

Commander: I questioned her as you were the one that was assigned the job, after all.

Commander: ...Huh? Could it be that you already knew about this?

M1918 doesn't seem bothered, and it seems like she has no intention of interrupting me.

I stop speaking and give her an apologetic look.

M1918: No, this is the first time I'm hearing about it, Commander.

Commander: ...You're not angry?

M1918: Why would I be angry?

Commander: That's, uh, well, because you worked so hard to decorate it...

Commander: Eh?

M1918: It doesn't really matter. I didn't put that much effort into it anyways.

Commander: Not that much effort...huh...

M1918: If SR-3MP wants to change the decorations then let her do it. It's rare for her to have any interest in doing this sort of thing.

Commander: I'll leave it to her then, since you don't mind.

Commander: But is it really okay, though? I thought you were heading to the event hall.

M1918: It's no problem. Someone as high up as you shouldn't have to worry about something so trivial, Commander.

M1918: Since the problem is solved now, I'm going to go take a nap... (Yawn)

Commander: Just how long have you been awake...?

M1918: Quite a while, but I'm alright.

M1918: Well then, Commander, I'll be on my way. I'll see you at the banquet.

M1918 waves at me and turns around to leave, yawning as she does so.

...At the company banquet.

M1918 dressed elegantly in an evening gown inspired by the latest trends exudes a completely different aura compared to her usual lethargic self.

She gives off the impression of a mature lady as she sips from her wine glass every now and then.

Commander: Hey. You're looking very different today, M1918.

M1918: (Chuckling) This is my "moment of truth", you know?

Commander: "Moment of truth"?

M1918: There are situations that even I won't treat so carelessly.

M1918: After all, for your sake, I will not let Griffin's reputation be sullied in front of outsiders.

Commander: You are reliable indeed, M1918!

M1918: You flatter me, Commander. This is what a T-Doll should do.

Commander: I didn't think much of it from looking at the guest list, but now that I'm here, the pressure from being around all these VIPs is starting to get to me...

M1918: Oh ~ ~, so the Commander isn't good with this kind of thing?

Commander: (Whispering) Please don't tell anyone.

M1918: Hehe, sure, Commander.

M1918: I'm feeling a little tired, though...

M1918: At an event like this, you can't just dress up and stand in the corner, you know~?

Commander: Yeah. I hope you'll be able to relax at the internal party later.

M1918: Yes, if I'm with everyone else, I'll be able to act like my usual carefree self...

M1918: I'm looking forward to it, Commander.

Commander: Me too. Keep up the mature adult act for just a while longer, I know you can do it.

...At the party that night.

Skorpion and SR-3MP, both dressed gorgeously, seem to be arguing about something while the Commander is sandwiched between the two, smiling helplessly.

Skorpion: I will never hand the title of “The Party's Most Dazzling T-Doll” over to you!

SR-3MP: Hmph! It belongs to me in the first place! You must be out of your mind trying to take something that isn't yours!

As I open my mouth to say something, a T-Doll claps her hands and leisurely strolls over.

M1918: Okay, okay... Both of you are being really noisy...

M1918: Are you two competing to be the noisiest T-Doll here tonight?

M1918 winks at me with a relaxed expression on her face.

Skorpion: M1918! Perfect timing!

Skorpion: You're old and know better, so tell us if I'm prettier, or if this lewd bunny is!

Skorpion: Quick, tell us!

M1918: Ah, well...

M1918: Both of you are very pretty.

SR-3MP: Aaaaaaah no, no, no! You can't just say both are pretty!

SR-3MP: I refuse to be put together with this tomboy!

Skorpion: Oh? Looks like you really want to get rid of that frizzy hair, huh?

M1918: You're forbidden from using your grenade here, okay?

M1918: It'll be a big mess and a hassle to clean up.

SR-3MP: Then, who do you think is prettier?

M1918: Both of you are very pretty.

SR-3MP: Th-th-then let's change the question! Who's the prettiest?

M1918: Both of you are the prettiest.

Skorpion: I thought we said you're not allowed to say both!!!

Skorpion: We want a comparison! A comparison!

M1918: Well, you're the noisiest right now.

Skorpion: ...Uwaaaaaaah! You beast-eared people! You're teaming up to bully me!

M1918: I will still say that both of you are equally pretty~

M1918: Also, I've said this many times already, but I don't have beast ears.

Skorpion: But...

M1918: Also, SR-3MP's bunny ears can be taken off. Haven't you known that since last year?

M1918: You should check if someone has normal ears before jumping to conclusions, okay?

SR-3MP: Hey, stop pinching my cheeks! You'll ruin my makeup!

Skorpion: Wait wait wait wait, ears or whatever, that's not the point, okay?

M1918: Oh, really? Your hair accessories are even weirder than beast ears, aren't they?

Skorpion: Is...it actually weird...?

M1918: (With a stern expression) That reminds me, did you call me old earlier?

Skorpion: Ah...!

M1918: Do you two want me to join in on this battle?

Skorpion: N-no...

SR-3MP: (Her cheeks being pinched) Wo.... W-wo... (N-no...)

...M1918 smiles again.

M1918: Then, let's stop arguing.

Skorpion&SR-3MP: ...

Skorpion&SR-3MP: (For some reason, they felt really tired and stopped arguing.)

M1918: All right, kids who don't fight are good kids.

M1918: Let's enjoy ourselves as much as we can before the party ends.

Skorpion&SR-3MP: (Silence)......

M1918: Oh, by the way, when I was coming over here, I saw many people that wanted to take pictures with you two.

Skorpion and SR-3MP look at each other, seemingly wanting to say something, but couldn't after being lectured by M1918.

With a big huff, both of them turn around to leave.

I look at M1918 and see that she still has the same relaxed expression on her face, sipping on her wine as she watches the two leave.

Commander: That was unexpected.

M1918: That those two children are so stubborn over who is the prettiest?

Commander: No, not that. I didn't think you would step in to deal with something like this.

M1918: Even though you may think it is a trivial issue, I consider this to be a "moment of truth" as well.

Commander: Just like what you said during the banquet earlier!

M1918: A party should be relaxing and enjoyable, right? I just didn't want the atmosphere to be ruined.

M1918: Look, everything's all good now.

Commander: You're pretty reliable when it comes to crucial moments.

M1918: Not at all. I just want to be able to thoroughly enjoy the rest of the party.

Commander: Looks like I've learned about something else that you'll take extra care in dealing with.

Commander: As expect of the big sister T-Doll. I must thank you for tonight.

M1918: (Chuckling) Is that so... Looks like I've surprised the Commander yet again.

M1918: Though... (Whispering) I really don't want to be thought of as the big sister...
