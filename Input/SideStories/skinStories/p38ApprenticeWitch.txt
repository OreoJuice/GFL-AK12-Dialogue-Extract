Gr G41: Uwah! Come look, everyone! The sea! It's the sea!

SPAS-12: Whatwhat? The sea's in sight already?

Ameli: We're finally here at the seaside!

Commander: While the dolls all know what the sea was, this should be their first time seeing it with their own eyes.

Commander: Seeing their excited faces makes me happy that I could bring them here.

Commander: —Of course, not everyone feels the same way.

AA-12: Urgh... shut up already...

Commander: Still, the most excited one of them all has her voice drowned out by the racket on the bus... and as usual, she doesn't realize it.

P38: Hehe...

P38: Watch me, great ocean...

P38: My time has come at last!

Commander: P38's friends aren't around today, so I'm hoping she won't go around making a ruckus...

We arrive several minutes later. The other dolls run to the seaside, but P38 runs up to me instead.

P38: Ta-dahhh! Commander, Commander, do you like how I look today?

Commander: Ah... it's not bad, not bad at all.

P38: Hah? How about being more specific in your praise?

Commander: Er... that shawl's pretty good, but wouldn't it be best saved for Halloween?

P38: What the heck! Commander, at least look at me when you're talking!

Commander: Even if you let me look at you... I'm not sure where I should put my eyes...

P38: Hah? Don't tell me you still haven't been infected by the romantic atmosphere of the beach yet, Commander?

P38: Then I'll sing you a song so you can lose yourself in a true summer vacation!

Commander: Huh? ...Ah? Hang on—

With that, P38 whips a mike out of her shawl and holds it high!

P38: Get ready, everyone—

Commander: Hold, hold on a minute! Do you carry a mike with you wherever you go!?

P38: Of course I do. As an idol, I have to be ready to give a performance anytime and anywhere!

Commander: Er, no, I mean...

Commander: (So she has an idol persona in her neural cloud? That detail doesn't stand out at all, just like herself!)

Commander: (But I can't possibly ask her about that, especially not now...)

P38: Commander? You were saying?

Commander: Ah, I was saying... look, now's not the time for this, is it?

Commander: We've come all this way; don't you think you ought to enjoy the beach and the sea with the others first?

P38: Hm... that does make sense...

P38: But I don't know who I should hang out with...

Commander: （P38 doesn't have many friends to begin with, and none of them came on this trip...)

P38: Rather than that... I think hanging around you would be better instead, right, Commander?

Commander: (She can't always be like this, I need to let P38 find new friends...)

Commander: P38, I have things of my own to do as well. Why don't you take this opportunity to make some new friends?

P38: Are you saying that.... I'm making trouble for you?

Commander: No, no, but if you're aspiring to be an idol, you'll need to be popular with a lot of people, right?

Commander: Why don't you use this opportunity to train yourself? Let me know if you run into any problems. How about it?

P38: Mm, that makes sense! Then I'll give it a try!

P38: As an idol, I need to challenge myself!

...After cheering herself up, P38 runs off towards the other Dolls.

Commander: Being obsessed with being an idol but never taking the initiative to approach others isn't good... although, can P38 really get along with the others...

Commander: Ah, forget it, I'll just take this opportunity to relax first...

However, a mere 10 minutes after sprawling onto a beach chair and carrying out that plan...

P38: Com—man—der—!

Commander: What, what's going on!?

P38 comes running back in a panic. Her body is covered in water and sand, as though she had rolled around on the beach several times.

P38: Commander, I, I just...

Commander: You just...?

I look nervously at P38's face. Something must have happened!

P38: W-while I was diving...

Commander: When you were diving...?

P38: I encountered a sea monster!

Commander: ...

Commander: Er... a sea monster?

P38: Yes! A sea monster!

Commander: ...What kind of sea monster are we talking about here?

P38: I don't know! I just saw something as tall as a Doll, as skinny as a Doll, and with four limbs like a Doll, swimming around in the ocean!

Commander: Something that was as tall as a Doll, as skinny as a Doll, and with four limbs like a Doll...

Commander: Isn't that just a Doll!?

P38: No, no it wasn't! It was all black! No Doll would show up on the beach wearing all black!

P38: And it was hidden under the water, it was super scary!

Commander: Er... So is that sea monster still in the sea?

P38: No... it was very fast, and it swam away in an instant...

Commander: Did anyone else see it?

P38: No, I was diving by myself...

Commander: Diving by yourself... P38, didn't I tell you to stay with the others?

P38: But I don't know how to approach the others, so I thought of relaxing by myself first...

Commander: Hm... why don't we go ask the other Dolls?

P38: Commander, you don't believe I saw a sea monster, do you?

Commander: No, that's not what I meant, I'm just saying that this stretch of beach ought to be very safe, and as for sea monsters... there shouldn't be any left in this day and age, so I need more proof...

P38: Which just means you don't believe me, right? Forget it, I'll go find it by myself!

P38 storms off by herself, in a direction where there's nobody around.

Commander: Hey! I'm just—

P38: Don't follow me, Commander! I'm going to personally find proof that the sea monster exists and and show it to you!

Commander: Be careful! Don't run around on your own!

Commander: (Honestly, what's she throwing that tantrum for...)

...Some time later, we end up having a beach volleyball game with DEFY, while P38 is probably still searching for evidence of the sea monster.

In the end, the game is stalemated by SPAS-12's final strike. As the destroyed volleyball falls at SPAS-12's feet, everyone's eyes wander around in silence...

SPAS-12: Uh...

AK-12: Now that the ball's broken, how should we determine the final victor, Commander?

Commander: ...

Commander: (How did things end up like this... we can't lose the match here...)

Commander: (There must be some blind spot in the rules that we can exploit! Now behold mankind's ability to make up complete nonsense!)

Commander: Ahhh, P38, you're here!

P38: Hey, what's everyone arguing about? Let me be the judge!

Commander: How come you're back?

P38: I thought that... it would be better if I came back to help everyone do something for the time being...

Commander: (Which means she failed to find any proof...)

AK-12: Miss Witch, what do you make of this?

P38: Hehe, it's obvious enough!

P38: There's more of it on our side, so doesn't that mean we won?

...

Commander: ...P38.

P38: Hm?

Commander: We're playing volleyball.

P38: Volleyball? What's that?

Commander: It's a game where you lose if the ball touches down in your area.

P38: Ehhhhhhhhhh!?

P38: No, no way, since when was there a game like this...

AK-12: Commander, even you've admitted that you've lost now...

P38: What...

Commander: In any case, well... we lost.

P38: We lost...

P38: And it was because of me!?

Commander: Ah no, it's got nothing to do with you...

Commander: Wait, P38, where are you going now!?

P38: There wouldn't be any sea monster here if it wasn't for me! And we wouldn't have lost either!

P38: Besides, nobody wants to hear me sing and nobody here needs me, right?

Commander: It's not that we don't need you! We...

P38: Then tell me, what can I do!?

P38 is on the verge of tears. She knows what her situation is like, both on the beach and back in the company...

Commander: P38...

Commander: How about this. I have a job for you. It's a very important job.

P38: What...kind of job...

...Evening, at the beach.

P38: In the end... I just ended up collecting firewood...

P38: Honestly... isn't this the same as what I do in Griffin? Doing pointless stuff every day...

P38: Is this really all I'm good for? ...The design settings in my neural cloud are just a burden on me...

Ameli: Ah, excuse me... P38?

P38: Are you... Ameli?

Ameli: Ah! You remembered my name.

P38: It's not a very difficult name to remember, is it? What are you doing here?

Ameli: I'm gathering wood for tonight's bonfire.

Ameli: The Commander said there'd be a helper. Is that you?

P38: Ah...I guess... Do you need help?

Ameli: Well, in terms of workload... not really.

P38: (quietly) As I thought... you don't need me after all.

Ameli: But... I'm glad you came.

Ameli: Doing this alone is a little...

P38: Do you want to hear me sing?

Ameli: Right now...?

P38: I'm sorry, my request was too absurd. Nobody would want to listen to me.

Ameli: Maybe tonight, at the bonfire.

P38: No, I'm sure everyone hates me.

P38: If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't have lost the volleyball match today.

Ameli: They won't hate you.

Ameli: After all... we lost a lot of times before that, not just that particular match...

P38: Should I think of it that way...

Ameli: Plus, we had already lost. No matter how much the Commander tried to cover it up, it was no use. All you did was... point out what was already there.

P38: So the Commander doesn't hate me? I'm really not sure...

Ameli: Why would he do that?

P38: I told the Commander I saw a sea monster, but I haven't found any proof of it so far.

Ameli: A sea monster?

P38: When I was diving by myself, I saw a black figure on the seabed, and then it swam off right away.

P38 describes what she saw.

Ameli: Huh?

Ameli: P38, is that true!? That really does sound like a sea monster!

P38 looks at Ameli's eyes, which are suddenly gleaming — she's definitely not just humoring P38.

P38: Ameli, do you believe what I'm saying?

Ameli: Yes, I do! That's because you're not a Doll who likes telling lies, P38! Those aren't your factory settings!

P38: Ameli...

P38: You really are a good person! You're a million times better than the Commander!

Ameli: If you ask me... it's not like the Commander doesn't believe you, the Commander just wants to know the truth...

P38: But... the Commander won't believe me if I don't find proof of the sea monster, ...

P38: Ahhhhhh! I want to find the sea monster! I don't care if it's really a sea monster or not, I just want a chance to clear my name!

Ameli: Ah, speaking of which...

Ameli: I found this on the seashore...

Ameli runs to the side and pulls out something weird from the pile of wood.

Ameli: P38, wanna see?

P38: Eh!?

P38: What... what is this!? It's filthy and gross!

Ameli: It looks like some kind of wreckage... I thought of it when you mentioned a sea monster...

Ameli: I don't know if this reminds you of anything...

P38: Hmm...it doesn't seem related...

P38: This thing... it looks pretty old, doesn't it? That sea monster was black, but it looked pretty fresh...

Ameli: Fresh, huh...

P38: Yeah, it wasn't sticky and stuff...

Ameli: So... was it a sea monster or not...

P38: You know, when you put it like that, even I don't know any more...

P38: What exactly was it that I saw...

Ameli: I think we've collected enough firewood. It's time to build the bonfire. Why don't you take the opportunity to show this to the Commander?

P38: Hm...

Ameli: Shall we go, P38?

Ameli: Er... P38?

P38: Ameli...

P38: Is it really alright to leave everything to the Commander?

Ameli: What do you mean?

P38: I suddenly feel that...

P38: This time, I ought to decide for myself.

Ameli: What do you want to do, P38?

P38 thinks, and then she suddenly pivots—

P38: Eeeiiii!

P38: You can have it back, Miss Sea Monster!

...And pitches the wreckage far into the distance.

It falls into the sea with a splash, and the waves drag it down to the ocean floor.

Ameli: P38, don't... don't you want that? That could be proof, you know?

P38: Now that I actually found the proof... it ended up feeling really annoying instead...

Ameli: But then...the sea monster you discovered...

P38: The sea monster isn't important any more.

P38: I was doing some thinking. Even if it WERE real, then what could I possibly do about it?

P38: It never had anything to do with me in the first place. If I hadn't met it, nothing would have happened.

Ameli: But...is this really alright? Don't you want to prove yourself to the Commander and everyone else?

P38: Well, I want everyone's approval, but I forgot why I wanted it...

P38: It shouldn't just be because I want people to approve of me, but because I want them to recognize me as an idol! All I want is to prove my determination as an idol, nothing else is important!

P38: Whether it's the sea monster or the volleyball game... they're all just pointless worries for me! All they're going to do is slow me down on my path to becoming an idol! That's right, that's how it should be!

Ameli: Ohhh, that sounds really cool, P38!

P38: Hehe, and besides, this outcome isn't bad either. You believe me, right?

Ameli: Yup, I believe you!

P38: Then are you willing to be a fan of mine?

Ameli: I've never heard you sing before, but I'm willing to try!

P38: Hehe, works for me, then!

P38: I'm guessing that the sea monster I met must have shown up in order to create an outcome like this!

P38: The sea must have prepared it to witness my arrival!

Ameli: Ohhh, P38! I'll do my best for you too! I'll spread the word and raise everyone's awareness of you!

...We finish building the bonfire after that, and everyone forms a circle around the fire to rest after a tiring day. Naturally, that includes me.

However, I'm still a little worried about P38, so I approach her as she's munching on an apple.

Commander: So, what did you find today, P38?

P38: What I found? I don't think I did anything today, did I?

Commander: Weren't you looking for evidence of that sea monster? What came of it?

P38: About that... well, it doesn't really matter.

Commander: Huh? Really? Before this, I saw you running around all day because of it.

P38: Would you have believed me if I ran around all day, Commander?

Commander: Well...

P38: So like I was saying, what you saw was just the outcome...

P38: Even if I HAD found the sea monster, it wouldn't have changed me in any way...

P38: So now I understand that the sea monster wasn't important at all.

Commander: is that so? Then what's important?

P38: What's important are my efforts to become an idol!

P38: I can't let a couple of sea monsters or volleyballs stand in my way!

Commander: No, they're not going to become your enemies!

P38: In any case, being an idol means I mustn't be bothered by how people look at me or let others judge my worth! Even if it's you, Commander!

P38 points at my nose, and if I was 2 centimeters closer she would have poked it with her nail, or covered my face in the half-chewed apple spraying from her mouth...

Commander: Is, is that so, well that's impressive...

Commander: I don't know what you went through, but it's good that you can think that way...

P38: Hehe, and now...

P38's usual smile returns to her face... I have to point out that this smile is very familiar to me, and I had even seen it when we had just arrived at the beach.

It's a sign of danger.

P38: Everyone, are you ready to embrace the summer?

But this time, I'm not going to interrupt her.

P38: If you're still hesitating, then let this song melt you more!

Because this time, she's got a real audience and fans.

Ameli: Do, do your best, P38!

...P38 is brimming with courage today, and she lets her voice echo across the beach for the first time.

AA-12: So... is that all?

Gr G41: For some reason... It feels like she needs a lot more practice...

FAL: 5-7 isn't so bad compared...

...Everyone responds to P38's performance with stiff and polite smiles, but she is also met with the sound of applause.

Gr G36: Keep it up, P38! Let your voice go!

SPAS-12: Encore! Encore!

It's true that there's a lot of room for P38's singing skills to improve... but at least, she's taken the first step towards becoming a proper idol.

She's no longer hung up on her design setting as an "idol", and she's not bothered by the looks that others give her. Instead, she's starting to truly and sincerely express herself.

So as a reward, I'll let her express herself to her heart's content tonight.

That said, she had splattered my chest with apple juice just now, and since she doesn't care how I look at her, I'll have to scold her for it...
