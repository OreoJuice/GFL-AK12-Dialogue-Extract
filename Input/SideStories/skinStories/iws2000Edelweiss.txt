...

IWS 2000: Let me think...

IWS 2000: Shirt, cloak, sash, belt...

IWS 2000: Right! Everything's there!

IWS 2000: Then I should get changed...nein, I should leave it for later...

...

IWS 2000: AUG, do you think I should get changed now?

IWS 2000: I know it isn't time yet, but if anything happens...

AUG: ...

AUG: Personally, I think you should go to bed immediately.

IWS 2000: That's out of the question! Everyone is taking this so seriously out there!

IWS 2000: But if I change into my outfit so early...and get it dirty, that'd be terrible...

IWS 2000: Or...should I ask for a third opinion?

AUG: SSG and G17 are both asleep. If it's something so important, you should decide on your own.

IWS 2000: But I'm worried that some unexpected accident will happen...

IWS 2000: If...you were me, would you get changed now?

AUG: ...

AUG: Snowy vestments are bound to be sullied. It is an eventuality that has no direct correlation to the passage of time.

IWS 2000: Okay! Then I'm getting changed right now!

AUG: (Mutters) Which is why I hate white clothes.

IWS 2000: Phew, all set!

IWS 2000: Hmm...AUG, do you think I'll look better in a black cloak instead?

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: But the others will also be in formal dress... Maybe I should put on more...

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: Say, AUG, should I prepare some gifts?

IWS 2000: Showing up empty-handed seems pretty impolite, don't you think...?

AUG: You've spent so much time on dressing up nicely, but why is Gepard M1's face printed on the lantern?

IWS 2000: Uh, no reason. You're reading too much into it...

AUG: That's what every cheating husband says as he starts placating his wife.

IWS 2000: I didn't even say anything! Let me explain!

IWS 2000: I honestly just think the way she completes every mission so diligently is very commendable!

IWS 2000: And what the hell is this whole cheating husband business?!

AUG: Just a purely coincidental association in terms of semantics. Don't read too much into it.

IWS 2000: You started it!

IWS 2000: Sheesh, it's finally the annual "New Year's Eve" that Big Sis 81 talked about... Just cut me some slack...

AUG: So we have invented a new festival to celebrate the fact that our planet has completed another orbit around the sun. Is it worth all that effort?

SSG 69: (Mumbles blearily) I think so...

IWS 2000: Aha! See, AUG? Even SSG thinks it is!

IWS 2000: Besides, WE didn't invent this festival. Humans have been celebrating it since a long, long time ago!

IWS 2000: I've got to be impeccably dressed today; there's just no cutting corners!

AUG: There is no correlation between T-Dolls and a festival celebrated by humans.

AUG: Or are you so eager to be out in the gust on a cold winter night?

IWS 2000: The cold isn't the key here!

IWS 2000: Everyone is always holed up at home in winter. Now we finally have a reason to visit each other and bolster our friendship - isn't that great?

IWS 2000: Life has to be lived ceremoniously.

AUG: I don't understand your neural cloud's penchant for imitating humans.

IWS 2000: That's fine, you'll understand when you take part!

IWS 2000: Make more conversation with everyone. Who knows, it may even change someone's gloomy image.

AUG: Vector has already provided a counter example, so my suggestion for myself is to turn in immediately.

IWS 2000: Hmm...

IWS 2000: Then...should I take SSG and G17 with me?

...A muffled voice comes from under the duvet next to them, but the words are unintelligible.

AUG: SSG agreed with you that this festival is well worth the effort. This shows how enthusiastic she is about it. You must absolutely bring her along, dear leader.

SSG 69: Argh, nein!!

SSG 69: I'd be happy to come any other time...but it's just too cold out there tonight! Let me say in the dorm!

IWS 2000: Are you sure you don't want to come...?

IWS 2000: AUG, it's not every day that—

AUG: I really appreciate your earnest invitation, but staying indoors holds a lot more appeal to us than this "New Year's Eve".

AUG: You really should set off soon. Any further delay would cause trouble for others.

IWS 2000: Ugh...

IWS 2000: Then I'll...be right back once I finish making my New Year visits.

AUG: Have a safe trip.

AUG: Also, you forgot your lantern.

...

IWS 2000: Hmm...?

IWS 2000: ...Huh?

...IWS finds herself all alone in the middle of the road.

IWS 2000: Why is nobody here...?

IWS 2000: Didn't they say they're all ready...?

IWS 2000: I guess...I'll just wait a little longer...

...

...IWS is still alone in the middle of the road.

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: Or have they already gone...?

...At Type 56-1's dorm.

She knocks.

No answer.

IWS 2000: ...Nobody here either?

IWS 2000: Where...is everybody...?

...IWS stands by the door entirely alone. The sound of firecrackers and fireworks comes from a distance.

IWS 2000: Why...

...

IWS 2000: Ugh...it's so cold...

IWS 2000: Who...

...

Hey—!

IWS 2000: ...Oh! Someone's over there!

IWS 2000: Fräulein 56-1! Guys! I'm here—

...IWS peers into the distance excitedly, but the area is completely deserted.

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: Was that...just the wind...?

IWS 2000: Did I mishear it...?

...

IWS 2000: Did I...get something wrong...?

IWS 2000: I thought we all agreed to visit each other...

...

Rustle.

IWS 2000: Should I keep looking...?

IWS 2000: ...Maybe I should just go back...

...Rustle.

IWS 2000: Nein! Pull yourself together, IWS!

IWS 2000: If I go back just like that, AUG will laugh her butt off! I can't just return without doing anything!

...

IWS 2000: Ha! I knew it was just the wind. I was right!

IWS 2000: Fräulein 56-1 wouldn't be so quiet— Uh...

...IWS notices a pair of golden eyes staring at her in the gloom.

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: ...

AUG: You are correct, dear leader. Type 56-1 and her friends do tend to make a lot of noise.

IWS 2000: Didn't you say you were going to turn in? Why are you here...?

IWS 2000: Wait, you heard everything I just s...

AUG: I don't remember any of it.

AUG: But I wasn't the one who promised to return soon. G17 is worried about you.

IWS 2000: ...I didn't realize I've been waiting out here for so long.

AUG: Really?

AUG: So what are your thoughts on the human tradition for celebrating New Year?

AUG: You must have received a lot of feedback regarding your elaborate preparations.

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: Nein, not at all...

IWS 2000: I...couldn't find the participants of the New Year visits...

IWS 2000: I tried looking for CZ75, but I didn't run into anybody even after I came back...

AUG: I was just asking out of interest.

AUG: Before hearing your squawk, I just brushed shoulders with Type 56-1 as I walked past her.

IWS 2000: You ran into them?!

AUG: And a certain T-Doll who is still working overtime.

AUG: If you missed them all, then you must've managed to steer clear of everyone along the way. Truly an exceptional feat.

IWS 2000: What?!

IWS 2000: How could...

AUG: I thought you were in search for some hustle and bustle. Who knew you'd rather celebrate New Year by enjoying the wind in solitude.

IWS 2000: ...

AUG: But then again, it is none of my business. Tschüss .

...AUG turns around to leave.

IWS 2000: W-wait!

IWS 2000: Where are you going, AUG?

AUG: Back to the dorm.

AUG: Now that I've confirmed you're in reasonably good shape, I can make myself scarce.

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: Then I...

IWS 2000: I'm coming back with you.

...AUG raises an eyebrow.

AUG: Didn't you just say you couldn't just go back?

AUG: You didn't want AUG to—

IWS 2000: Argh! So you DID hear everything!

IWS 2000: I said that because...I just couldn't accept the fact that...I didn't run into anyone...

AUG: But you're all satisfied now that you've run into me?

AUG: If you have just a little more persistence, you could very well come across more Dolls wandering about.

AUG: Don't you want to show your lantern to the person whose face is printed on it?

IWS 2000: I do want to...but I don't even know where to go...

IWS 2000: 56-1 and the others have probably wrapped up their visits by now... In that case, it doesn't even matter where I go...

AUG: ...It was rare to see you preparing for something that isn't a mission with so much enthusiasm.

AUG: If you don't mind letting all your effort go to waste, I have no problem with that either.

IWS 2000: It's not a problem of wasted effort...

IWS 2000: Whether it's this New Year activity or the preparations I've made...none of it matters now.

IWS 2000: Other than coming to terms with what happened, there's nothing else I can do... Perhaps I should've learned this lesson ages ago.

AUG: ...

...The hazy candlelight from the lantern illuminates the path back to their dorm. Not another soul is in sight along the way.

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: ...AUG?

AUG: I don't know.

IWS 2000: Let me finish, dammit!

IWS 2000: What did you mean...when you said you'd confirmed that I was "in reasonably good shape"?

AUG: G17 speculated that you would exhaust your battery due to over-excitement and collapse in the snow, unnoticed.

IWS 2000: As if I would neglect such basic maintenance on myself!

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: Did G17 actually think that would happen?

AUG: I was lying. She's fast asleep.

IWS 2000: Phew...that's good to hear...

IWS 2000: Sigh...I didn't expect things would turn out this way when I set off.

AUG: What DID you expect?

IWS 2000: I don't know either...

IWS 2000: "New Year's Eve"... Big Sis 56-1 and the others all wanted me to take part in the activity...

IWS 2000: I thought I could've at least done something for them...

AUG: Working blindly only to earn other's recognition. This outcome is hardly surprising.

IWS 2000: I wasn't working blindly!

IWS 2000: At least this time...the outcome didn't mean that much to me! I am NOT dejected over the fact that I didn't run into anybody...

AUG: You've devoted so much time and effort to putting together your new outfit. Are you not eager to receive compliments?

AUG: That has to be why you'd make that kind of face just before you left.

IWS 2000: What do you mean "that kind of face"?!

IWS 2000: You say that as if you've been peeking at me all the time!

AUG: I hardly have to peek. I honestly pray that I don't have to see a certain Doll being all bubbly the moment I open my eyes.

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: Is that so...

AUG: Both today and last Halloween...

AUG: Your reward wasn't commensurate to your efforts. You know that better than anyone else.

IWS 2000: ...Perhaps.

IWS 2000: All I can do...is to take this lesson to heart.

AUG: Then I'll leave it to you to adjust your mentality.

IWS 2000: Sigh...

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: ...Hmm?

...

IWS 2000: AUG?

AUG: I don't know.

IWS 2000: AUG, are we...walking back to our dorm?

AUG: Is that something worth questioning?

IWS 2000: It's pretty dark so I can't see very clearly...

IWS 2000: But we aren't walking in the right direction, are we?

AUG: That's because it isn't easy to plan a route back home from your previous location. We have no choice but to take a detour.

AUG: If you don't trust me, feel free to find your own way back.

...IWS comes to a halt.

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: We're at the archive, AUG.

AUG: Are we?

AUG: The lights are off in the building though. What a shame.

IWS 2000: ...You said someone was working over time. Where is she working overtime?

AUG: I forgot.

AUG: I'm sure that hardly matters—

IWS 2000: You only say "I forgot" when you're lying.

AUG: Then please substitute what I just said with "I don't know".

IWS 2000: Just admit it!

IWS 2000: ...

IWS 2000: There you go again... Why must you always...!

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: Why?!

IWS 2000: Things don't have to be so complicated!

AUG: There's someone I know. She has very high expectations on everything, but in truth, she often ends up biting off more than she can chew.

AUG: Whenever things take an unexpected turn, she copes with her situation in a really silly manner. It's exhausting to watch.

IWS 2000: ...Humph.

IWS 2000: If it's so exhausting, you can very well just let her be...

AUG: I'd want to.

AUG: But it's pretty easy to make this a meaningful night.

IWS 2000: You insisted that we were heading back to the dorm...

AUG: Technically, we are. We've merely taken a convenient detour.

AUG: The footprints on the snow are still fresh. Gepard M1 is on her way to the dorm.

AUG: According to the schedule, 56-1's group should be in the building directly ahead of us. If you're lucky, you can still meet up with them and make it in time to pay Groza a visit.

IWS 2000: ...

AUG: Well? Still haven't decided which direction to go?

IWS 2000: Let's go back, AUG. It's getting late.

AUG: ...

AUG: I hope...

AUG: I hope this is a carefully calculated decision, not an impulsive whim.

IWS 2000: It is. It's enough.

AUG: The choice you just made is precisely what makes you so aggravating.

AUG: Compared to watching you be a goody-two-shoes then regretting it, I'd rather you stick to being a fool.

IWS 2000: Really?

IWS 2000: But I know what you're actually thinking. This doesn't happen very often.

AUG: ...You're assuming I was telling the truth.

IWS 2000: I mean it... It's enough.

IWS 2000: Say, AUG, you...

AUG: I don't know.

IWS 2000: Just let me finish, okay?

IWS 2000: All this time, I've been working very hard because I care a lot about what others think of me...but I am trying to change.

IWS 2000: I'm...not as weak as you think, at least not anymore.

AUG: I vaguely recall a girl standing all alone in the snow with a lantern, looking really despondent.

IWS 2000: I admit I still feel disappointed when I'm not rewarded for my efforts...

IWS 2000: But to me...the outcome is no longer everything.

AUG: An IWS who no longer values the outcome or others' recognition.

AUG: What does she want from life then?

IWS 2000: Nothing, really.

IWS 2000: It's not like...I have to be seen making an effort.

IWS 2000: Looking at it that way, I have no reason to be sad even if nobody sees the work I put in. Simple!

AUG: That sounds like something SSG would say, not you.

IWS 2000: It wouldn't be strange for me to say that!

IWS 2000: Rather than having the whole world know how hard I've worked, it's more important for someone I care about to see the fruits of my labor.

IWS 2000: That's why I'm not bothered by what happened tonight.

AUG: The Commander isn't here though.

AUG: Congratulations. All your hard work in the last two days has not paid off.

IWS 2000: The Commander isn't here, but you are.

IWS 2000: Haven't you been with me the whole night?

AUG: You have such unreasonably low standards for yourself. Your roommate can't actually help the fact that she saw everything you did tonight, even though she had no desire to.

IWS 2000: But to me, all my hard work HAS paid off as long as you saw it.

IWS 2000: I...can live with that.

AUG: But it's someone else's face on your lantern.

IWS 2000: Why do you care so much about whose face is on the lantern?!

AUG: I repeat - you have unreasonably low standards for yourself.

IWS 2000: Neither of us are how you think we are.

IWS 2000: You have too little confidence in yourself and in me.

AUG: That's because compared to "me", "everyone" is more important to you.

IWS 2000: That's how I used to be, and it caused me great pain.

IWS 2000: I also...ended up leaving a very bad impression on you all.

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: I used to believe that I must make myself twice as useful. I thought that was the only way for Tactical Doll IWS 2000 to prove her worth...

IWS 2000: ...until I met the Commander...and you, AUG—

AUG: Can you stop? I don't really want to listen to your cheesy confession.

IWS 2000: Is it cheesy? You have very low standards.

AUG: ...Ack.

IWS 2000: If it weren't for you...I probably wouldn't have changed. I'd still be going to extraordinary lengths just to be recognized.

IWS 2000: But that's such a painful way to live, and it isn't worth it. That's what you've taught me.

AUG: As if you didn't put on your last performance for people's recognition.

IWS 2000: Heheh, if you hadn't been there among the "people" beneath the stage, I wouldn't have been satisfied no matter how loud the cheers were.

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: Phew... We should go back already. It's so cold out here...

AUG: ...Ja, let's go home.

IWS 2000: A Doll's worth isn't determined by the Doll herself, Fräulein AUG.

IWS 2000: If we aren't worthy of other's recognition, we are basically failures.

IWS 2000: You asked me what I believe in... This is my answer.

AUG: ...

IWS 2000: AUG, stop spacing out!

IWS 2000: At this rate, we won't make it back till the sun comes up!

AUG: Why don't you just leave me and keep walking?

IWS 2000: How could I do that? What if I walk too far ahead...and don't see you there when I look back?

AUG: ...Is something wrong with your neural cloud?

IWS 2000: It's not a bad thing to be mentally prepared for misfortune.

IWS 2000: It's called constructive pessimism!

AUG: ...

AUG: I will keep watching you...until I can't anymore.

IWS 2000: The wind was really loud, I didn't hear you.

IWS 2000: What did you just say?

AUG: ...

AUG: Nothing. I'll say that again on New Year's Eve in ten years' time.

IWS 2000: But it's still a bit of a shame that only you guys saw my cloak.

AUG: I take back what I just said. And you're getting on my nerves.

IWS 2000: ...So what was it that you just said?!

IWS 2000: Eh, nevermind.

IWS 2000: Things are...quite nice the way they are, don't you think?

...Clatter.

IWS 2000: We're back—

IWS 2000: ...

AUG: ...

G17: ...

Gepard M1: ...

Gepard M1: Sziasztok.

Type 56-1: Oh, you're finally back! What took you so long?!

IWS 2000: ...Huh?!

IWS 2000: W-w-w-w-why are you all here?!

IWS 2000: And what are you doing?!

Type 56-1: Why are we here...? Didn't we agree on making New Year visits?

Type 56-1: We couldn't find you outside, so we just made our way here looking for you.

Type 97S: We were itching for a game so we just randomly grabbed someone off the street...

Type 97S: But we seem to have awakened a formidable monster...

IWS 2000: Hold on... I still don't get it...

IWS 2000: What is this thing...you're all sitting around...?

Type 97S: You haven't seen this before, IWS?

Type 97S: My, Spring Festival isn't complete without this. It's called...

Gepard M1: Mahjong.

Gepard M1: Great Winds, all Honors.

Type 97S: ARGHHHHHHHH!

G17: This game is called "Watch How Gepard M1 Claims To Be A Noob But Is Unbeatable". Pretty straightforward, isn't it?

Gepard M1: But...the game really isn't that hard...

IWS 2000: Still...I totally didn't expect all of you to be gathered here...

Type 97S: That's enough. Hurry up and take a seat!

Type 97S: Alright! This is the decisive final round!

Gepard M1: Mahjong with an Earthly hand.

Gepard M1: Thirteen Orphans, concealed hand.

Type 97S: ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

AUG: Why are you making such a face, dear leader? Are you not happy with how things have turned out?

IWS 2000: I just...don't know what to say...

AUG: You don't need to say anything.

AUG: Just think of it as fate acknowledging your efforts.

IWS 2000: Fate, huh...

IWS 2000: Rather... You never commented on my new outfit, AUG.

AUG: ...I dislike white clothes, so I have nothing to say in regard to its aesthetics.

AUG: Besides...

IWS 2000: Hmm?

AUG: The very sheen that makes "white" pales in comparison to you...

AUG: It just isn't fair at all.
