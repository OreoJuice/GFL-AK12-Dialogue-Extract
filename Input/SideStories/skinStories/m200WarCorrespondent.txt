...

Knock knock. A light rap on the door jolts M200 awake.

She hurriedly halts the process of clearing her cache and jogs over to open the door.

M200: Please come in... Huh?

QBU-88: Hi.

M200: Hello, QBU-88. Is something the matter?

M200: Have I missed a notice...?

QBU-88: Not at all. May I come in?

M200: Oh yes, please.

M200 welcomes QBU-88 into her room and closes the door.

M200: Would you like something to drink?

QBU-88: Oh, I get offered a drink! What do you have?

M200: I've got black tea, juice, coffee, milk, fruit tea, ginger tea, hot cocoa, and green tea. Oh, there's also mulled wine, though I'll have to heat that up...

QBU-88: Whoa, hold it. Just a fruit tea will do.

QBU-88: Are you planning to open a beverage store with Springfield or something?

M200: No, I just bought a bunch of ingredients to practice making different kinds of drinks.

M200: Here, fruit tea for you.

QBU-88: Thanks.

QBU-88: ...This tastes good! What's the brand?

M200: It's my own formulation. If you like it, I can give you some to take with you.

QBU-88: Thanks! I love this tangy flavor.

M200: So... May I ask why you're here...?

QBU-88: Didn't Groza just send out a recruitment for party organizers?

QBU-88: I saw your reply. You said you can't participate because you have an assignment.

M200: Oh, yes.

QBU-88: We checked the logs. You accepted that assignment AFTER she made the recruitment post.

M200: ...

QBU-88: You never say no to social gatherings, as far as I know?

QBU-88: I just find this pretty odd. Is there someone you don't want to meet at the party?

M200: Oh, it's nothing of that sort!

M200: I'm just having some personal issues...

QBU-88: What kind of issues?

M200: Uh... I just have some thinking to do. It's not a good idea to bother others over something so trivial!

M200: Don't worry, I can sort it out myself.

QBU-88: You probably can, but if you tell me, it could be solved more quickly.

QBU-88: And you don't have to feel like you're bothering me. I came precisely for this matter.

M200: Hm... Thank you. So this is what happened...

...

Several minutes later.

QBU-88: So basically, you tried to interview some refugees, but they refused to cooperate.

M200: Yeah... I wanted to shoot some post-war footage and edit them into a documentary for the celebration this year.

M200: But apart from ruins, all I've got so far is grief-stricken people who have lost their home...

QBU-88: Isn't that only to be expected? War is destructive to begin with.

M200: I disagree. We are a security company, are we not?

M200: We fight to protect more people, to put an end to strife, and to usher in an era of peace, isn't that right?

QBU-88: Yeah... Sounds about right.

M200: But is there really any meaning to all the fighting we've done?

M200: No matter how hard we try to defeat our enemies, innocent civilians keep getting dragged into the war and end up getting killed.

M200: We are Tactical Dolls, we were not created to prevent war – we perpetrate violence... There's no way we can end the bloodshed.

M200: On top of that, we keep causing suffering.

QBU-88: But just letting our enemies storm through our defenses will result in even more suffering.

QBU-88: There is meaning to our fight.

M200: You have a point... (Sighs) I do feel better now that I've got it off my chest.

M200: Thank you. Next time there's a party, I'll definitely make time for it!

QBU-88: I'm glad to hear it.

QBU-88: ...Hold on, so you're still not coming to this party?

M200: Huh? It's a shame, but...

QBU-88: The solution is right in front of you. It's just taking out a few enemy targets. It won't take long if the two of us set off soon!

QBU-88: Those abandoned mechs have been getting on my nerves for a while now. Rather than letting them saunter around for a couple more days, why don't we wipe them out now and come back for the party?

M200: Oh... Sure.

M200: Can I really handle another fight so soon?

QBU-88: Where's the location of your assignment? Let me see...

QBU-88: Oh! Theater No. 3 is pretty close. Let's go!

M200: Huh? We're going right now?!

QBU-88: No time like the present!

With just the two of them, the Dolls head towards the target location promptly...

An hour later, in Theater No. 3.

QBU-88: These abandoned mechs were a piece of cake. Your assignment is all done, yeah?

M200: Yes.

M200 puts down her rifle and studies the mechanical remains all around her.

M200: Thank goodness these weren't piloted by that man...

QBU-88: What do you mean? They're still weapons created for human use.

QBU-88: Strange... Why can't I find that spot?

M200: 88? What are you looking for?

QBU-88: It's a secret.

With that, she wanders off and continues her search.

QBU-88: Hm... Mm... Found it!

QBU-88: M200, over here.

M200 walks over and squats down to look at what QBU-88 is pointing at.

Behind the crumbling wall, a patch of lovely roses bloom silently.

M200: ...Huh? How can there be flowers here?

QBU-88: If memory serves, Theater No. 3 used to be a botanical conservatory in the Yellow Zone.

QBU-88: It was razed to the ground in the war, but this little patch came out unscathed.

QBU-88: There weren't any flowers the first time I came. The botanists must've been forced to evacuate shortly after they planted the seeds.

QBU-88: But look, they're now flourishing!

M200: They managed to keep growing because we've been holding this place?

QBU-88: That's right. As long as we don't pull back our line of defense, more flowers will grow here.

M200: ...

M200 stares intently at the roses.

Under the clouded sunlight, they look so fragile, yet so vibrant in the ashy soil.

M200: New life that grows out of land baptized by the flames of war...

M200: I must take some pictures of it!

QBU-88: Take as many as you want. It's pretty safe here. You can go absolutely crazy.

M200: Are there more flowerbeds like this one in other places?

QBU-88: Probably...? There might be more somewhere farther away from the war zone. I'm sure we'll find them if we take the time to look.

QBU-88: Let's do that, shall we?

M200: Yes, please!

M200 snaps picture after picture while QBU-88 keeps searching for more flowers. The two Dolls end up trekking across most of the theater.

QBU-88: Oh, there are flowers over here, M2— Huh?

M200: What? Did you say some... QBU-88!!

A half-buried mech suddenly comes to life.

Its remaining mechanisms are still operational - it grabs QBU-88 and lifts her off the ground!

QBU-88: H...Help!!

M200: Crap...

M200 puts down her camera and starts firing at the mech.

But her rushed attacks merely leave dents on its armor and cause no significant damage.

Meanwhile, the soil around her starts quivering, and more mechs rise to their feet.

They loom over the petite M200 and have her completely surrounded.

M200: No, this isn't something I can handle...

M200: Hailing Groza! Come in, Groza!!

OTs-14: What is it, M200? The party...

M200: Miss Groza, we need help!!!

OTs-14: ...

OTs-14: Calm down, M200. What is the matter?

M200: We've encountered numerous abandoned mechs in Theater No. 3, some of them still have intact firing modules, and they've captured QBU-88!

M200: I've sent you our coordinates... Please get here ASAP! Thank you very much!

M200: Even if Miss Groza sets off immediately, it will still take her a while to get here... I've got to stall them for at least 10 minutes!

M200: I'm going to damage their joints... Dammit, they have armor even on their joints!

Her successive shots finally draws the mech's attention. With QBU-88 in one hand, it reaches out to grab M200 with the other.

M200 stops immediately to dodge its attack and returns fire.

QBU-88: Ugh... Arghhh...

M200: Oh no... Keeping it on edge only makes it tighten its grip...

M200 comes to a decision.

She stops running, props up her rifle, and aims straight for the weak point in the mech's leg.

At that moment, she does not dwell on the danger she's in; she is completely focused on her determination to save her friend.

She fires at the same instant when the mech takes a swipe at her.

Bang!

M200: ...I got it!

The mech falls onto its knees abruptly. However, it soon regains its footing by shifting its weight onto the other leg...

Meanwhile, alerted by the loud gunshot, the other mechs turn and close in on M200...

M200: No way...

QBU-88: It-it's leaving... Help! Where is it taking me?

M200: I'm going to shoot its joint again... Crap... I'm out of ammo!

M200: The mech shambles forward, its busted leg dragging heavily behind it.

M200: The other mechs are blocking her off. Her analytic system keeps issuing warning after warning.

M200: Retreat! Retreat! Retreat immediately!

M200: Are there really no other alternatives...?

M200: No, they still have 88. I've got to—

OTs-14's Voice: I see it! M200, close your eyes!

M200: ...!

M200 obeys without question.

A dazzling flash lights up the inside of her eyelids. When the brightness subsides, she feels a warm hand on her shoulder.

OTs-14: Are you okay, M200?

M200: I'm fine... QBU-88...

QBU-88: I...fuh...duh...

M200: Some of her modules must've been damaged...

OTs-14: You two, retreat back to base.

M200: There are way too many mechs. Will our reinforcements...

M16A1: We'll handle it just fine. Get her out of here.

As a recent recruit, this is the first time M200 has personally met M16A1.

M16A1 is practically a living legend, and M200 decides to put her faith in her.

M200: ...Okay. Sorry to trouble you.

M200 hoists QBU-88 onto her back and starts making her way back to base, leaving OTs-14 and M16 to deal with the situation.

M200: Fighting... There's no end to it.

M200: I have to rely on others just to protect the friend that came with me... Do I have no value at all apart from fighting?

The gunfire coming from behind fades into the distance, and M200 gradually slows her pace.

With QBU-88 on her back, she takes in this desolate battlefield dejectedly.

Then all of a sudden, she catches sight of a dash of vivid blue.

Right by the road not far from the battlefield is a bush full of blue roses.

M200: A blue...miracle.

M200: If I had run away just now, this place would've been destroyed...

M200: ...

M200: Thank goodness.

...

A few days later, on the day of the party.

M200: There, the editing is done. I have no idea why a simple party requires such a formal opening, but this kind of production value should be adequate!

M200: ...

M200: I haven't seen 88 ever since we came back days ago... I wonder how she's doing.

M200 sits in silence for a while before finally closing her editing software.

M200: She's probably at the venue by now. Those Chinese Dolls all love lively occasions and are team players... Or she wouldn't have bothered offering her help to a casual acquaintance like me.

M200: ...Should I go to the party after all? I already participated as a photographer, right?

M200: I really want to tell her the conclusion I've come to after days of thinking...

Incoming transmission request.

M200: Hm?

M200: Hello, M200 speaking.

QBU-88: M200, come to the banquet with me!

M200: ..."Banquet"?

QBU-88: I've sewn a dress for you. Try it on!

M200: But...

QBU-88: I'm outside your door already. Open up!

This unexpected turn of events leaves M200 totally disoriented.

She opens the door, and QBU-88 comes rushing in with a dress.

QBU-88: Try it! I made it just for you.

M200: Oh... Uh... Okay.

M200: What do you think?

M200: I personally think it suits me.

QBU-88: Eh, it'll do.

M200: "Eh"? You're not happy with it?

QBU-88: I was just being modest. What I mean is, "Yes, it's perfect!"

QBU-88: It's decided, then. You'd better come tonight.

With that, QBU-88 takes her leave.

M200 stares at her reflection in the mirror and fiddles with her skirts bashfully.

M200: Oh... I forgot to tell her... But I'll have the chance tonight.

M200: I'll include it as the opening dedication in my documentary... Uh, maybe I'll edit it right now.

...

M200: This short film is dedicated to all my comrades-in-arms and a special friend.

M200: War isn't just about destruction; there is meaning to our fight.

M200: We will put an end to strife, so that new flowers will bloom in the ruins...

M200: Real peace will be upon us some day, but for now, let us raise a glass to this brief moment of respite!
