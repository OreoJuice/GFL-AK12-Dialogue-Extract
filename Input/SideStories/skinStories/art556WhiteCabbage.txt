In the Griffin dorms.

Commander: S.A.T.8?

Commander: Are you there, S.A.T.8? ART556?

ART556: Oh, it's the Commander!

ART556: Nope, that fuzzy monster isn't here.

Commander: She isn't here?

Commander: If I'm not mistaken, you and S.A.T.8 were assigned to make firecrackers, right? Why aren't the two of you together?

ART556: S.A.T.8...gave me a list of ingredients to buy...

ART556: And after I bought them, she chased me away!

ART556: Honestly! I'm so bored now... What's the point in taking part in the preparations if I can't play with firecrackers?!

Commander: (Is S.A.T.8 worried that ART556 would cause an accident around explosives, given her personality? It's quite understandable, to be honest...)

Commander: ART556, the preparations were never meant to be fun.

Commander: Many exciting events are only possible because people put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes.

ART556: I don't caaaare, I'm bored noooow!

ART556: Commander, do you have anything fun to do? Do you? You do, right?

Commander: I can't help you right now. Type 81R asked me to go check on the various teams.

Commander: I'll play with you later, okay? But before that, can you tell me where S.A.T.8 is?

ART556: She said she'd be making the fireworks by herself this time, then she locked herself in the warehouse in the back and she hasn't come out since.

ART556: Be careful! She'll snap at anyone who gets close!

Commander: Mm, got it.

After checking on S.A.T.8's situation, I meet ART556 again by the warehouse door.

ART556: She chased you out too, didn't she? I just knew it!

ART556: You must agree that S.A.T.8 is nasty, right, Commander? She takes everything way too seriously and is so pig-headed!

Commander: It's not like that, ART556.

Commander: The Spring Festival was a very meaningful occasion in the old days, and an East Asian T-Doll like Type 81R can't afford to treat it carelessly even in this modern age.

Commander: So while it's true that S.A.T.8 is being a little too serious about this, that's just how she shows that she's being responsible.

ART556: I don't understand such outdated logic!

ART556: Boredom is the most fearsome enemy of them all! What's the point in obeying all those rules if you can't live your life happily?!

On the afternoon of Spring Festival Eve, the door to the warehouse where S.A.T.8 is making the firecrackers and other pyrotechnics is slightly ajar...

ART556: Hahaha! I — found — it!

ART556: This is awesome! There are so many here!!

ART556: S.A.T.8 locked herself up in here for so long because she wanted to set all these off, right?!

ART556 moves the various firecrackers and fireworks from the warehouse and dumps them into a pile on an open patch outside.

ART556: Let me see... Ohhh...this ought to be in a bucket...

ART556: And this ought to explode here...which means I have to light it from...

As ART556 says so, she lights all the fuses...

ART556: Hah! This is how it should be!

ART556: Let's see whether the fireworks S.A.T.8 made were a success!

The first things to go off are the firecrackers...which are followed by the other shells exploding and throwing sparks everywhere...

Even the other firecrackers and fireworks - which she has not lit - are ignited in turn...

ART556: Ohhhh! What a sight!

ART556: This is amazing! Isn't this a great success?!

And so, the fireworks which S.A.T.8 had been working so hard to put together for tonight go up in smoke.

Half an hour later...

After everyone has finally extinguished the tragic aftermath, I head to a corner and grab ART556, who is very intimidated by S.A.T.8's violent outburst.

Commander: ART556, do you know what you did wrong?

ART556: I made S.A.T.8 mad...

ART556: Because...I ruined all the firecrackers and fireworks she made...

Commander: I told you before how much thought and effort S.A.T.8 put into them.

Commander: And in the end, you ruined them all just for fun.

Commander: I don't usually like to do this sort of thing, but your lack of restraint leaves me no choice but to put you into detention.

ART556: Detention?! Noooo!

ART556: Commander! I'm sorry!

ART556: Please! I'll apologize to S.A.T.8! Please don't put me in detention!

Commander: But the fireworks we were supposed to set off tonight won't come back just because you apologize to S.A.T.8.

Commander: I think it's necessary so you remember the consequences of the trouble you caused.

ART556: (Sobs) Commander...please...

ART556: I...I'll find a way to get the fireworks back! I promise!

Commander: Tell me how, then. If you can't, it's detention for you.

Commander: Same thing goes if it involves hurting someone else.

ART556: I...uh...I...

ART556: I got it! Since, if it's firecrackers...

ART556: The most important thing about firecrackers is the loud noise they make, right? So if we can simulate that noise...

ART556: That's right! If we can simulate firecracker noises at the fireworks show, it'll be like getting the firecrackers back!

Commander: (Instead of finding more firecrackers, we can reproduce their sound... I didn't think of that...)

Commander: (Sighhh... If only she would save all her bright ideas for useful things like this...)

ART556: That should be okay, right, Commander? I'll go prepare the stuff right away!

ART556: Please, please don't put me in detention!

If ART556 truly wants to make up for her mistakes, then the whole matter of simulating the sound of firecrackers will be her last chance.

From the reports of the people I have secretly sent to monitor her, she seems very serious for once...

Commander: (Sighs) At long last, we've made it to the Reunion Dinner...

Commander: No more surprises now, just let me sit down and eat in peace...

ART556: C-Commander...

Commander: Oh, is that you, ART556? I heard those sound effects.

Commander: Still, even though we got through it this time, you still owe S.A.T.8 an apology. Got it?

ART556: I know...

ART556: Commander...this...uh...

ART556: This lunchbox...is for you...

Commander: Hm? Where did you get this from?

ART556: It's a secret recipe from the kitchen...

ART556: And... I'm sorry for going overboard...

Commander: It's fine as long as you know what you did wrong. Next time, think about how others feel before fooling around, got it?

ART556: Okay...

Commander: Then we'll leave things at this for now.

Commander: If you mess up again, I really will throw you in a detention cell right away.

ART556: Okay... Obrigada, Commander.

Griffin T-Doll: ART556! What are you still doing here?!

Griffin T-Doll: MT-9 found a weird can in the back, and she says there's something moving inside it!

ART556: Huh?! How could MT-9 just leave me behind to play with fun stuff on her own?!

ART556: Where is she?! Take me there! We're going to open that can no matter what's inside!

ART556 happily runs off with the others to parts unknown.

Commander: Hm...looks like she's not going to learn this lesson any time soon...

Commander: Is it because it didn't leave a lasting enough impression?

Commander: Ah, forget it. I won't press any further, considering what day it is today.

At midnight..

Although things had not gone as smoothly as planned, the sound of firecrackers and the fiery main event of pyrotechnics leave everyone with good memories, and serve as a perfect ending to this Spring Festival Eve celebration.
