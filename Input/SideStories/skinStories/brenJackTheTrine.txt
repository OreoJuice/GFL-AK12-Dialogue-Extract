MDR: Yes, it is Death! Death is upon us! Nobody shall be spared! Hahaha!

S.A.T.8: Eeep...Aaaaaahhhh!!

Bren: (S.A.T.8 is so over-the-top. Is it really that scary...?)

...Several minutes later.

S.A.T.8: Hold on, I-I'm still calibrating... My neural cloud is a little...

S.A.T.8: It...it's Bren's turn next, isn't it? Please get ready...

Looking incredibly pale, S.A.T.8 gasps for air as she stares frightfully at the "phantom" fabric covered in red powder lying on the floor.

S.A.T.8: Phew... That really scared the living daylights out of me.

MDR: Hehehe...

S.A.T.8: MDR, I know exactly what you're planning.

S.A.T.8: You'd better not upload anything that happened today onto Griff-chan!

MDR: Aw, c'mon! You were so funny, S.A.T.8!

MDR: Trust me, it would become the hottest thread of the day!

Bren: I suggest you don't do this.

Bren: If the Commander finds out about this, you probably won't have the chance to spam the forum for the rest of the week.

S.A.T.8: Th-that's right!

S.A.T.8: Besides, we'd make trouble for Miss Kalina, who arranged this secret venue for us!

MDR: Tsk, but it's such a shame not being able to share this on Griff-chan...

MDR: I've prepared so long for this day.

MDR snaps her phone shut.

S.A.T.8: (Whispers) Thanks, Bren.

Bren: Don't mention it. I'm doing this for my own sake, too.

S.A.T.8: Still, please don't make your story too scary.

Bren: What's the point of a ghost story if it isn't scary?

TAC-50: That's right, there's a first for everything, S.A.T.8.

TAC-50: Now that you've heard a ghost story, it should be easier to mentally prepare yourself.

S.A.T.8: But it feels the same no matter how many times I've done this.

S.A.T.8: ...Aren't you even the slightest bit scared of ghosts?

Bren: Certainly not. It's actually strange for a Tactical Doll to be frightened of such things.

S.A.T.8: But think about it. An endless maze with labyrinthine passages... A dark space filled with ghosts and monsters... And horrific laughter that comes from nowhere!

S.A.T.8: Any of these scenarios is enough to make my neural cloud go haywire...

Bren: Stop spooking yourself, S.A.T.8.

Bren: If I ever found myself in those situations, I'd just destroy the ghosts or monsters. Then everything would return to normal.

TAC-50: But that'd be boring...

TAC-50: If it were me, I'd explore the whole thing and find the treasure hidden within the maze!

Bren: When in an anomalous situation, shouldn't it be the priority to eliminate the anomaly...?

TAC-50: But Halloween is supposed to be strange!

TAC-50: The fact that you're taking part in our event proves that you're also seeking thrills that you can't get in your daily life, right?

Bren: Don't lump me in with you.

Bren: I just happened to be free so I got dragged here by your scaredy-cat organizer to boost your numbers.

MDR: Hey, shouldn't you be getting back on track?

MDR: I'm almost done writing a ghost story post.

S.A.T.8: Don't tell anyone about tonight!

MDR: Alright! Anyway, let's move on to our next ghost story. Hurry up, Bren!

Bren: Right then, here I go.

Bren picks up a burning candle. The faint candlelight flickers eerily before her.

Bren: This is a story that took place in a theater...

Bren: ...

Bren: What was that?

TAC-50: Some kind of malfunction in the lights?

Bren: Doesn't matter... It seems to have returned to normal. I shall continue.

Bren: Before the new play had its premier, some strange noise could be heard in the empty and spacious auditorium every night.

Bren: The management had been trying to find the source of the noise but to no avail.

Bren: Until one day, when the theater was being renovated and they opened up the wall...

Bren: ...and found...

...

A vast amount of data suddenly floods Bren's neural cloud and interrupts her thoughts for a second.

Then...

This is...

The warehouse is gone. Bren finds herself in a glamorous theater.

The auditorium is completely empty except for...

(Whimpers)

Bren: That sounds like...S.A.T.8?

Bren searches in the direction of the voice and finds a panicking S.A.T.8 in between two rows of seats.

S.A.T.8: Ugh...what in the world is going on?! What is this place?!

S.A.T.8: And where is everybody...? How did this happen?!!

Bren: S.A.T.8, calm down!

Bren: I'm Bren, I'm standing right next to you!

S.A.T.8: Oh, it's you... Thank goodness...

S.A.T.8: Sorry, my neural cloud is a mess right now. Let me organize my thoughts...

...A few minutes later.

Bren: So right now we're trapped within an unknown database on Level II?

S.A.T.8: Yeah, theoretically speaking, that should be the case.

S.A.T.8: The others probably also got dragged in.

Bren: We should leave this place.

Bren: Do you know where the others are, S.A.T.8?

S.A.T.8: All I can do is detect their presence... I can't lock onto their precise locations.

S.A.T.8: Sigh, if only I had a specialized electronic warfare module.

Bren: It's only natural we aren't equipped with things we don't normally use.

Bren: In that case, let's just focus on finding the exit. The others can all fend for themselves so there's probably no need to worry.

SAT8

Bren: S.A.T.8, you don't look well.

S.A.T.8: We're in a completely unknown space, you know...

S.A.T.8: I just can't shake the feeling that there's something bad around here.

Bren: Something bad?

S.A.T.8: Might even be electronic ghosts or something...

Bren: Huh?

S.A.T.8: It's Halloween so this kind of supernatural stuff is bound to happen, right?

S.A.T.8: But we're Dolls, so instead of encountering human ghosts, we're seeing electronic ones especially created for us...

Bren: I'm surprised you have time to think about this kind of stuff...

Bren: Are you using up all your RAM to process such useless thoughts?

S.A.T.8: Uh...well...

Bren: Concentrate on finding the exit. If we do come across your so-called "electronic ghosts", we'll just have to fight.

S.A.T.8: Okay, I understand... Let's go then.

The two Dolls leave the theater and walk along a dimly-lit hallway.

S.A.T.8: This is a huge theater, isn't it?

Bren: Indeed.

Bren: (But why a theater...?)

S.A.T.8: ...Whoa!

Bren grabs hold of S.A.T.8, who almost tripped.

Bren: Are you alright?

S.A.T.8: I'm fine... Just tripped on a pumpkin decoration.

S.A.T.8: Shouldn't have brought so many with me...

S.A.T.8: But there's no way I could know beforehand, is there? Ahaha...

Bren: Say...are you sure you're fine?

Bren: I expect a Griffin elite to react more calmly in such a situation.

S.A.T.8: Sorry for the trouble... I'll try my best to keep calm.

S.A.T.8: This hallway seems to go on and on, doesn't it...?

Bren: (A theater...)

S.A.T.8: Bren, are you listening?

S.A.T.8: I think I see...

Bren: (I felt something strange when I started talking about the theater out there...)

Bren: (Could it be...)

S.A.T.8: Bren!

Bren: Huh...?

S.A.T.8: Bren, are you alright? You've been spacing out...

Bren: I'm fine, just thinking about something.

Bren: Perhaps I might have something to do with our being here...

S.A.T.8: What?

...Bren explains her suspicions to S.A.T.8.

S.A.T.8: That could well be possible.

S.A.T.8: Perhaps something in your story triggered this paranormal incident.

Bren: ...If that's true, then this is entirely my fault.

S.A.T.8: No one could've seen this coming, so it isn't your fault.

S.A.T.8: You just so happen to have told a ghost story that MIGHT have triggered this.

S.A.T.8: To be fair, it could've been any of us, don't you think?

Bren: You are all victims here so I must at least take some responsibility for what's happening...

S.A.T.8: ...

Bren: S.A.T.8?

S.A.T.8: Let's leave this discussion about responsibility for later. The bad things have shown themselves!

...

S.A.T.8's pumpkin attack eventually disperses the mob of electronic ghosts that had the two Dolls surrounded.

They finally manage to find a way out once things have settled down.

S.A.T.8: Right, we'll be able to get out of here soon!

S.A.T.8: But do you mind giving me a second, Bren...? There's something I need to sort out over here.

Bren: Sure, take your time.

S.A.T.8: Is there something on your mind?

Bren: It it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have been able to get out of that.

S.A.T.8: We're companions from the same base. Don't mention it.

Bren: I apologize for being rude to you earlier.

Bren: And if I had noticed the sign of danger sooner...

S.A.T.8: Haha, why are you taking such things so seriously, Bren?

Bren: What?

S.A.T.8: To me, this is hardly anything so serious that you have to take "responsibility" for.

S.A.T.8: This isn't a mission... We just got together to share stories for fun to begin with.

Bren: ...

S.A.T.8: Just enjoy this festival like TAC-50.

S.A.T.8: Now that I think about it, she must be having the time of her life right now...

Bren: ...I suppose that's how you elite Dolls are different from us.

S.A.T.8: This has nothing to do with being an elite or not. You've simply been too tense.

Bren: Too tense?

S.A.T.8: Precisely. The "Conqueror of the Training Ground" is quite famous among the Griffin Dolls.

Bren: What sort of nickname is that...?

S.A.T.8: In any case, you should chill and relax when it's time to rest. Proper rest is also key to getting stronger!

S.A.T.8: I'm sure the Commander would agree.

Bren: Chill and relax...? That does sound pretty nice.

Bren: Since we're in an electronic haunted house, we should enjoy this adventure that's tailor-made for us.

S.A.T.8: Haha... I won't say I'll exactly enjoy that, but I suppose this is what Halloween is all about?

Bren: Then let's turn back and explore the place.

S.A.T.8: What?!

Bren: ...Alright, maybe next time.

S.A.T.8: Phew... Don't scare me like that, Bren.

Bren: We'll save that for next time too.

Bren: Right, let's get out of here...or we'll never get to finish the ghost stories.

S.A.T.8: Okay, then let's go!

...

......

And that's how we spent the bizarre night.

S.A.T.8 ended up freaking out over all the ghost stories. Looks like TAC-50's exposure therapy doesn't actually work.

As always, Griffin is filled with a bunch of unruly dorks with no sense of danger... But that isn't really a bad thing.

At least I learned a new way of getting stronger tonight...so I got something out of this experience.
