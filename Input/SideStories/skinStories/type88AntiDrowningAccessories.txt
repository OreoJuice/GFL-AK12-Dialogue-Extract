【72 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】

QJY-88: Don't panic, QJY-88.

QJY-88: I still have 72 hours, it's going to be fine.

QJY-88: It's just putting together an anti-drowning device, right? That's simple enough...

QJY-88: If only if I had some inspiration...

Two hours ago.

Commander: ...Right, that's all the intelligence we have regarding this mission.

Commander: Break into your assigned groups and get to know each other.

Commander: Dismissed.

QJY-88: Rescue team...

QJY-88: But I don't know how to swim...

Serdyukov: Hello, QJY-88.

Serdyukov: I'm Serdyukov.

QJY-88: Hello... nice to meet you!

Serdyukov: The Commander has informed me of your situation.

Serdyukov: This mission isn't particularly challenging, and I'll give you some training beforehand.

Serdyukov: So there's no reason to worry at all~

QJY-88: Okay, thank you...

QJY-88: She did say that, but I feel bad for relying too much on Serdyukov...

QJY-88: I should still prepare some kind of contraption for myself in case of an emergency...

【48 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】

QJY-88: I can't go on anymore. I haven't slept for an entire day.

QJY-88: I need to rest and clear my cache...

QJY-88: But I haven't even come up with the blueprint...

QJY-88: ...

QJY-88: Guess I'll just hang on for a little longer.

【36 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】

QJY-88: ZzzZzzz...

QJY-88 dozes off with her chin resting on her hand. Her elbow starts sliding outwards...

QJY-88: Whoa!

QJY-88: When did I fall asleep...?

QJY-88: Oh crap, I only have 36 hours left!

QJY-88: Now I'm REALLY short on time!

QJY-88: Time to wake up! Gotta finish this design already!

【18 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】

QJY-88: Phew...

QJY-88: Finally, some progress...

QJY-88: Let me make a prototype following this design.

QJY-88: Only 18 hours left... Don't think I'll have time to optimize or even test it...

QJY-88: I'll just do whatever I can.

【6 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】

QJY-88: The anti-drowning device prototype is finally complete. Time to install it and see if it works.

The exhausted QJY-88 climbs onto the workbench and lies down. She picks up the equipment and studies it carefully.

QJY-88: Hmm, at least the installation port fits perfectly...

Her fingers slip and the equipment falls smack onto her face.

QJY-88: Oww... That hurt...

QJY-88: I hope I didn't break it...

【0 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】

Commander: QJY-88, are you there?

Commander: We're setting off!

QJY-88: ZzzzZzz...

Commander: Q...QJY-88?

Commander: Wake up, QJY-88!

QJY-88: ...Hmm?

QJY-88: Commander! Is it time to go?!

QJY-88: I'll be right there...

...

Commander: ...Now go and change into your battle gear.

Commander: After that, just head straight to the designated location and start your mission.

Commander: I'll join you later to check on your progress.

QJY-88: Serdyukov can probably do the job even without me.

QJY-88: Actually, she might actually have an easier time doing it without me...

QJY-88 peers at Serdyukov, who's getting ready, and sighs softly. Then she wanders off in the other direction alone...

She finds a remote corner and hides inside a large, unused crate.

From there, she takes out her anti-drowning device.

QJY-88: ...

QJY-88: I have no idea if you're going to work...

QJY-88: I wonder if I should even hope that you'll come in useful...

She installs the equipment onto herself.

【Anti-drowning device successfully installed.】

【Synchronizing...】

【...30%...50%...75%...】

【99%】

【...】

【.......】

【Synchronization complete.】

QJY-88: It's installed!

QJY-88: Maybe it's really going to work!

QJY-88's eyes brighten, but the glimmer goes out pretty soon.

QJY-88: I think I'd just stay here after all.

QJY-88: Swimming is scary, and so is the sea...

QJY-88: If I really have to rescue somebody, this incomplete anti-drowning device is my only hope.

QJY-88: If it doesn't work, I'll surely become a laughing stock...

QJY-88: Ugh...I don't want to be laughed at...

QJY-88: I just want to be a part of them...

Commander: QJY-88? Are you there?

QJY-88: Is the Commander...looking for me?

QJY-88: I'm really touched...that it didn't take the Commander long to realize I was missing.

QJY-88: Still, I'd better stay hidden.

QJY-88: If I'm found, I'll definitely get scolded.

QJY-88: If they never manage to find me, will the Commander just leave me behind...?

Commander: There you are.

QJY-88: Commander, I...

Commander: What are you doing alone in that big crate?

QJY-88: I don't want to drag Serdyukov down...

QJY-88: It'll be easier for her if she carries out the mission on her own...

Commander: Have you talked to Serdyukov about this?

QJY-88: I...

Commander: She was the first one to notice you were gone.

Commander: She's looking for you everywhere even as we speak.

Commander: She has even designed a life-saving course tailored specially for you.

QJY-88: ...

Serdyukov: QJY-88, there you are.

Commander: I'll leave her to you then.

The Commander claps QJY-88 on the shoulder in encouragement, then heads off to check on another team.

QJY-88: I'm sorry, Serdyukov...

QJY-88: I was such a pig-headed...

Serdyukov: It's okay, QJY-88.

Serdyukov: I didn't consider how you'd feel about your first mission in the sea.

Serdyukov: I only focused on physical training and neglected to provide emotional support.

QJY-88: You've already given a lot of thought about me as your new partner.

QJY-88: Thank you...

Serdyukov: I was just as flustered as you the first time I went on a maritime mission.

Serdyukov: But you're better than me for being brave enough to show your fear and anxiety.

Serdyukov: Back then, I put on a calm face but was actually scared to death.

Serdyukov: But instead of having a problem with me, my team leader had a lot of faith in me.

Serdyukov: If it hadn't been for her, I would've failed that mission, and I probably wouldn't have gone on any more maritime missions.

Serdyukov: Which is why I want to pass on the faith she had in me to you.

QJY-88: But I can't swim at all...

QJY-88: And don't even start on life-saving skills...

QJY-88: I'm no good...

QJY-88: I was planning to build an anti-drowning device.

QJY-88: But I didn't have enough time.

QJY-88: And it's still incomplete...

Serdyukov: The fact that you tried to make it already proves that you want to accomplish this mission, isn't that right?

Serdyukov: That's a good start, even though it may not have worked out perfectly.

Serdyukov: Still, my life-saving training might just give you what you need!

Serdyukov drags QJY-88 over to the seaside.

QJY-88: ...NOOO!!!

...

Serdyukov: QJY-88, open your eyes.

QJY-88: Are we getting close to the sea?

QJY-88: The air smells salty...

Serdyukov: That's right, I'll be giving you your first experience of the ocean.

Serdyukov: Come, take a step forward. Can you feel the cool seawater?

QJY-88: What?!

QJY-88: Whoaaa! It's scary!

QJY-88 brushes off Serdyukov's hand and runs off with her eyes squeezed shut in fear.

Dashing about blindly, QJY-88 steps onto an inflatable ball left on the beach and falls flat on her face.

Serdyukov: QJY-88!

Serdyukov: Are you alright?

QJY-88: This...

QJY-88: ...is what beach sand feels like?

QJY-88: It's so soft...

Serdyukov: That's right.

Serdyukov: Even the ocean has a gentle side if you just open yourself to it.

Serdyukov extends her hand again to QJY-88. After a moment of hesitation, QJY-88 takes it gingerly.

Serdyukov's hand is even softer than the sand on the beach.

Serdyukov: Let's try it again, okay?

QJY-88: Okay...

Serdyukov gently leads QJY-88 by the hand to the beach where the waves wash ashore.

The cool water laps up the soft sand, rushing happily over their feet, then retreats just as happily back into the sea.

QJY-88 stares at Serdyukov in mild surprise, and the two exchange a smile.

Serdyukov: Let's start our life-saving training right here!

QJY-88: Okay!

An hour later.

Serdyukov: So that's pretty much it regarding basic life-saving technique.

Serdyukov: Now we should start patrolling to make sure everyone is safe!

QJY-88: I have accumulated a lot of knowledge about life-saving, but somehow I have a feeling that...

Serdyukov: Don't worry, let's revise everything as we make our rounds!

QJY-88: I'll try to put everything into practice just to make sure I have it all down.

QJY-88: Phew... Let me refresh my memory...

QJY-88: First...we need to warm up?

QJY-88: Then...

Serdyukov: Are you very anxious?

Serdyukov: That's natural. It also means you take your companions' safety seriously.

Serdyukov: With this anxiety, you'll be extra cautious in the face of potential hazards.

QJY-88: You mean...

QJY-88: Being anxious makes me more perceptive of hidden problems?

QJY-88: Hmm...that does make sense...

Serdyukov: What I mean is that if you can't stop yourself from being anxious...

Serdyukov: Then simply don't consider your anxiety as a kind of hindrance. Make it your strength instead.

QJY-88: Make anxiety...my strength?

Serdyukov: That's right. For example, you were super anxious when you accepted this mission, worrying how you wouldn't be up to the task.

Serdyukov: This anxiety drove you to create the anti-drowning device.

Serdyukov: As I said before, that's a very good start.

QJY-88: Actually, this anti-drowning device is just an external storage module installed onto a swim ring...

QJY-88: But I did put a lot of thought into minimizing the size of the swim ring without compromising its durability...

QJY-88: And how to inflate it instantly when it's activated...

QJY-88: This is just the very first prototype attempting to solve these problems.

QJY-88: Which means...I never got around to actually⁠—

QJY-88 faintly hears a shrill scream coming from the sea.

AHHHHHH—

QJY-88: Did you hear that, Serdyukov?

Serdyukov: Hear what?

QJY-88: I think someone's shouting for help over there...

Serdyukov: You think so? But the sea looks very calm to me...

Serdyukov: Let me check with my binoculars.

Serdyukov jogs back to where she placed her bag for her binoculars.

QJY-88 stares at the sea in a daze.

QJY-88: Am I so nervous that my auditory system malfunctioned?

QJY-88: But that scream sounded so real...

QJY-88: If I didn't mishear it, the only ones operating at sea right now could only be the investigation team.

QJY-88: Lewis is fishing by the sea right now, so that only leaves R93.

QJY-88: R93's physical traits are⁠—

QJY-88 keeps a close eye on the surface of the sea as she accesses her neural cloud.

QJY-88: Oh right, pink hair like that over there!

QJY-88: Wait... is that R93's head?!

QJY-88: What should I do?!

QJY-88: Should I head over to save her?

QJY-88: Serdyukov said...

QJY-88: I'm carrying everyone's faith...

QJY-88: ...Deep breaths.

QJY-88 closes her eyes. In that instant, the air grows still, the waves settle down, even the squawking seabirds fall silent.

...

QJY-88 opens her eyes and dashes into the ocean fearlessly.

QJY-88: R93!

QJY-88: Hang in there! I'm coming to save you!

QJY-88 runs on with the salty air blowing against her face and the cool seawater curling around her feet. Even the chattering seabirds seem to be cheering for her.

She keeps running without a second thought, but her body suddenly starts feeling heavy, and every stride takes immense effort.

By the time she realizes something isn't right, the water already comes up to her chest.

The sudden wave of panic causes her knees to buckle.

QJY-88: Whoa...

QJY-88: Calm down, QJY-88!

【Anti-drowning device activating.】

【Warning – anti-drowning device activation failed.】

QJY-88: How come...?

QJY-88: ...No...

【Anti-drowning device reactivating.】

【Warning: anti-drowning device reactivation failed.】

QJY-88: Help! Cough, cough!

QJY-88: I...(gurgles)...can't swim!

QJY-88: (Ugh... Is this all I can do...?)

QJY-88: (Even though Serdyukov put so much effort in training me...)

QJY-88: (But I still...can't do it...)

QJY-88: (I...must be a huge disappointment to her...)

Serdyukov: QJY-88! I'm coming to help you!

QJY-88: (Ugh...Serdyukov!)

QJY-88: (She's coming to save me...)

QJY-88: Serdyukov!

QJY-88: I...(gurgles)...here!

Serdyukov: I'll be right there!

QJY-88: (Is that what a professionally trained lifeguard looks like?)

QJY-88: (She's swimming so hard just to save me...)

QJY-88: (Huh? That's...a crow?)

QJY-88: (Why is the crow carrying Serdyukov's bag and throwing stuff at her?)

QJY-88: (Serdyukov seems to be struggling...)

Serdyukov: Argh! (Gurgles) My...

Serdyukov: ...leg...is malfunctioning... (Gurgles)

QJY-88: (Serdyukov!)

QJY-88: (...No!)

QJY-88: (What should I do?)

QJY-88: (The things Serdyukov taught me in her life-saving training...)

QJY-88: (Remember! Hurry up and remember them, QJY-88!)

Serdyukov: I was just as flustered as you the first time I went on a maritime mission.

Serdyukov: But you're better than me for being brave enough to show your fear and anxiety.

Serdyukov: Back then, I put on a calm face but was actually scared to death.

Serdyukov: But instead of having a problem with me, my team leader had a lot of faith in me.

Serdyukov: If it hadn't been for her, I would've failed that mission, and I probably wouldn't have gone on any more maritime missions.

Serdyukov: Which is why I want to pass on the faith she had in me to you.

...

Serdyukov: If you can't stop yourself from being anxious...

Serdyukov: Then simply don't consider your anxiety as a kind of hindrance. Make it your strength instead.

QJY-88: (Exhales)

QJY-88: First, keep calm. Don't struggle or flail around, find my own balance.

QJY-88: Then try to keep my nose out of the water. Exhale softly, inhale deeply.

QJY-88: Now go around the drowning person and hold her from behind.

QJY-88: Right, I'm holding Serdyukov.

QJY-88: Now go to the surface again to catch my breath...

All this while, QJY-88 can sense the feeling of trust and security from Serdyukov as they slowly approach the surface of the sea.

During this process, QJY-88 comes to a sudden realization.

QJY-88: Hold on a second?

She stands up straight abruptly and the glittering seawater comes up to just below her chest.

QJY-88: ...

Serdyukov: ...

The two flustered girls make their way awkwardly to the shore.

The moment their feet reach the soft and dry sand, they slump heavily onto the beach.

Serdyukov: ...

QJY-88: ...

Serdyukov: Pff-Hahahahaha...

QJY-88: Hahahahahaha...

Serdyukov: That must've been...

Serdyukov: One of the top ten ordeals I've ever had in my career, hahaha...

QJY-88: No, it was all my fault...

Serdyukov: If you hadn't come and saved me, we'd both be lying in the repair bay.

Serdyukov: I knew I was right to have faith in you~

QJY-88: Ugh... Thank you, Serdyukov.

QJY-88: If it weren't for you, I'd probably still be cowering in the big crate.

QJY-88: I would definitely not have the courage to run out to sea...

QJY-88: Though we could both have...

Serdyukov: ...I won't tell a soul.

Serdyukov: In return, don't mention my malfunction just now...

QJY-88: Serdyukov... Haven't we forgotten something...?

Serdyukov: ...

Serdyukov: R93 is still...

Serdyukov: We've got to tell the Commander right now!

On the beach bathed in warm sunlight, the two flustered girls set off running hand-in-hand.
