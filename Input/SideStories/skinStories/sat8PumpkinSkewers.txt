In the Griffin dorms.

S.A.T.8 is sitting at her desk, going through her checklist item by item.

S.A.T.8: Participants... No problem there.

S.A.T.8: Special costumes for the festival... Hmm, all done.

S.A.T.8: Next is...

...Click

...A comms request.

S.A.T.8: Oh, Miss Kalina!

Kalin: S.A.T.8, are you busy?

Kalin: The stuff you applied for is ready.

S.A.T.8: Fantastic! Thanks a bunch, Miss Kalina.

Kalin: Don't mention it, it hasn't been used in a long time anyway.

Kalin: However, some of the bulkier old equipment hasn't been moved away, so make sure you leave them alone when you're using the space...

Kalin: Also, about the Commander...

S.A.T.8: I understand. Don't worry, Miss Kalina.

S.A.T.8: I'll swear everyone to secrecy and tell them not to touch anything.

...Transmission terminated.

S.A.T.8: Hmm...that's the venue settled as well.

S.A.T.8: All that's left is the props and tools...which have all been procured.

S.A.T.8: Lovely, everything is ready! Now we just have to wait for Halloween...

Having gone through her entire list, S.A.T.8 lets out a long sigh.

S.A.T.8: At last, all done.

S.A.T.8: I didn't expect organizing a small event to be such hard work... I've got some new-found respect for the Dolls who put together our previous events.

S.A.T.8: Still...

She stacks everything on her desk into a tidy pile and smiles faintly.

S.A.T.8: I managed the planning and preparations of this event all by myself.

S.A.T.8: That should make me a capable and independent Doll, right?

...On the night of Halloween.

Despite S.A.T.8's careful preparations, unexpected things still ended up happening.

S.A.T.8: Ugh...what in the world is going on?! What is this place?!

S.A.T.8: And where is everybody...? How did this happen?!!

Bren: S.A.T.8, calm down!

Bren: I'm Bren, I'm standing right next to you!

...

Once S.A.T.8 finally gets a grip, she starts searching for the exit with Bren in this cyberspace.

S.A.T.8: (First I freaked out because of some ghost story, now I got lost in some unknown cyberspace.)

S.A.T.8: (I'm supposed to be the organizer yet I lost my composure... Bren must be really mad...)

S.A.T.8: (Hmm...)

S.A.T.8: (This silence is getting awkward. Maybe I should make some conversation.)

S.A.T.8: This is a huge theater, isn't it?

Bren: Indeed.

S.A.T.8: ...Whoa!

Bren grabs hold of S.A.T.8, who almost tripped.

Bren: Are you alright?

S.A.T.8: I'm fine... Just tripped on some pumpkin decoration.

S.A.T.8: Shouldn't have brought so many with me...

S.A.T.8: But there's no way I could know beforehand, is there? Ahaha...

Bren: Say...are you sure you're fine?

Bren: I expect a Griffin elite to react more calmly in such a situation.

S.A.T.8: Sorry for the trouble... I'll try my best to keep calm.

S.A.T.8: (Sigh, why did I even make so many pumpkin decorations...? Now they're getting in the way.)

S.A.T.8: (Bren must be really angry. It's all my fault...)

S.A.T.8: (Looks like I still have a ways to go to becoming an independent Doll...)

...A few minutes later.

At the end of the hallway, S.A.T.8 and Bren see something they have never seen before.

Those entities are covered in strange colors – almost like half-mixed paint – and their forms keep twisting and writhing.

Despite being semi-translucent phantasms, they emit a low but piercing noise that's decidedly not human.

Even with her hands over her ears, the noise is transmitted directly into S.A.T.8's neural cloud.

Bren: You're right, this looks really bad...

S.A.T.8: Electronic...ghosts...

Bren: Run, S.A.T.8! They're coming!

The electronic ghosts come charging towards Bren and S.A.T.8. Bren tries to fend them off while dragging S.A.T.8 down the dark hallway.

Bren: Unfortunately, it would seem that you called it.

S.A.T.8: I...I'm sorry...

S.A.T.8: I'll take full responsibility and try to get us out of this!

Bren: It's partly my fault too...

Bren: In any case, just leg it for now. Who knows what's going to happen if they catch up with us!

...

The two Dolls fight their way back down the hallway.

Bren: S.A.T.8, behind you!

S.A.T.8: Oh...crap!

...Click.

Bren! S.A.T.8! Where are you?!

Do you copy?!

A transmission comes in out of nowhere. It soon grows fuzzy and dissolves into a burst of static.

S.A.T.8: Bren, did you hear that? Just now it...

Bren: I heard it. It sounded like someone was calling us.

S.A.T.8: That signal seems to be from Fr FAMAS. She isn't part of this event.

S.A.T.8: Maybe our disappearance has been noticed! Someone will probably come to our rescue soon!

Bren: I sure hope so.

S.A.T.8 and Bren open the door at the end of the hallway.

Bren: ...We're back at the theater?

S.A.T.8: It LOOKS like the same theater, but our coordinates are definitely different.

Bren: It doesn't seem like there are any ghosts here.

S.A.T.8: That's great, then let's get some rest here. I'll try to find the exit.

Bren: ...Thanks.

S.A.T.8: It's no big deal, we're both from Griffin, after all...

Bren: Right...

S.A.T.8: Okay, then please keep an eye on the surroundings.

Bren: Will do.

S.A.T.8: (I can't afford to mess up anymore! I must get Bren safely out of here.

S.A.T.8: (Right, browsing database...)

S.A.T.8: ...

S.A.T.8: (Where can I find a node that'll allow us to disconnect...?)

Bren: S.A.T.8, they're coming!

S.A.T.8: What?!

A large number of electronic ghosts come through the walls of the theater and surround them both.

Bren: Dammit, there are so many of them!

Bren: S.A.T.8, have you found the exit?

S.A.T.8: N-not yet...

Bren: ...Then we'll have to force our way through. Let's get to somewhere safe first!

S.A.T.8: But even if we manage to give them the slip, it'll only be temporary; they always find us in the end.

S.A.T.8: Is there some other way...

S.A.T.8 looks around and suddenly notices that several ghosts have stopped next to a pile of pumpkin decorations.

S.A.T.8: Don't tell me...

Bren: S.A.T.8, have you got an idea?

S.A.T.8: They seem to have a thing for pumpkins.

S.A.T.8: Bren, take this pumpkin and try throwing it!

Bren: Tsk... This feels a little stupid but it's better than nothing.

Bren: Here, a pumpkin for you! Go!

Bren lifts up one of S.A.T.8's pumpkin decorations and throws it far, far away.

The ghosts closing in on them change direction and go charging after the pumpkin.

S.A.T.8: Great, draw them away just like that!

...

With S.A.T.8's pumpkin stratagem, the two Dolls manage to disperse the mob of electronic ghosts that had them surrounded.

S.A.T.8 and Bren seize the chance and leave the theater. They end up inside a warehouse-like structure.

S.A.T.8: This looks like a good place to resume my search for an exit.

S.A.T.8: My processing capacity is limited...so this may take a while.

Bren: That's fine... We aren't really pressed for time at the moment.

S.A.T.8: Right, these...

S.A.T.8 takes off the remaining pumpkin decorations on her and puts them all into a box nearby.

Bren: What, aren't you looking for a way out?

S.A.T.8: I've already started the search.

S.A.T.8: I just thought...you might get a bit bored during the wait...

S.A.T.8: So it might be a good idea to carry out the rest of the event right here.

Bren: ...Why don't you just focus on your job?

S.A.T.8: I'm already pushing my electronic warfare module to its limit, you know! This is the best I can do.

Bren: You elite Dolls are so willful...

Bren: Fine, do as you like. I suppose you won't be able to concentrate if I don't let you continue, isn't that right?

S.A.T.8: Heheh... I mean, we're safe for the moment and there's nothing else to do.

S.A.T.8: So if we go by the order, I'm the next one to tell a ghost story.

Bren: Is it really okay for someone scared of ghosts to tell a ghost story?

S.A.T.8: Hey, don't underestimate me!

S.A.T.8: I came fully prepared!

Bren: Alright, then show me how prepared you are.

S.A.T.8: Right, so I'm going to tell a story about an island...

S.A.T.8: Once there was an island. When the humans had a plague, the infected people would be sent to that island for isolated treatment.

S.A.T.8: During the years of the plague, those who lived on the shore of the mainland could hear the screams coming from the island even though it was miles away!

S.A.T.8: Those screams seemed to traverse impossible distances, going straight into people's heads...

S.A.T.8: ...

S.A.T.8: (Hold on... The ghosts we came across just now made that sort of noise as well...)

Bren: Uh... S.A.T.8, you're squishing that pumpkin in your hand.

S.A.T.8: I-I haven't finished yet!

S.A.T.8: The island was forgotten after the end of the epidemic...

S.A.T.8: Until many years later, when a curious filming crew of a TV show about paranormal activities visited the island.

S.A.T.8: They live streamed their adventures there but then the audience realized that the crew were disappearing one after the other... In the end, even the live stream got cut off.

S.A.T.8: From then on, none of them have been seen ever again...

Bren: S.A.T.8, you don't look so...

Bren: S.A.T.8? S.A.T.8!

S.A.T.8: ...Arghhhhhh!

Bren: Calm down, S.A.T.8!

Bren: Sheesh... How could anyone freak out over their own ghost story?

...

After calming down once again, S.A.T.8 finds an exit out of cyberspace.

The two Dolls return to reality safely.

...On All Hallow's Day.

S.A.T.8: ...Phew, all done.

S.A.T.8: As per the plan, none of the remaining pumpkins have been wasted – they've all been made into pastries.

S.A.T.8: Sigh, that's the only part of the event that actually went according to plan.

S.A.T.8: Guess I'll treat everyone to these for the trouble last night...

S.A.T.8 places the pumpkin pastries into her bag and leaves the kitchen.

S.A.T.8: They should all be at the café right now.

S.A.T.8: Bren is probably there as well? I wonder if she told anyone about what happened yesterday...

S.A.T.8: Sigh, getting spooked by my own ghost story. How embarrassing...

S.A.T.8 heads over to the café with a heavy heart.

...At the entrance of the Griffin café.

S.A.T.8: No matter what happens, I'll have to face it.

S.A.T.8: Show some courage as a mature Doll!

S.A.T.8 gives herself a pep talk and pushes open the café door.

Oh, it's you, S.A.T.8. What took you so long?

S.A.T.8: C-C-C-C-C-C-Commander?!

S.A.T.8: W-w-w-w-what are you doing here?!

Uh...well, I just came here for my break and ended up chatting with the Dolls here.

They told me you've organized a little celebration for the festival here.

S.A.T.8: (Great, looks like the Commander is only here by coincidence.)

S.A.T.8: (I hope no one has told the Commander about yesterday...)

S.A.T.8: Uh... I did organize this. Just wanted to prepare some snacks for everyone, that's why I got held up.

S.A.T.8: Here's my homemade pumpkin pie. Would you like to try some, Commander?

Sure, let me taste this... Oooh, it's delicious!

S.A.T.8: I'm glad you like it.

As expected of S.A.T.8. You're always so caring when it comes to your friends.

S.A.T.8: D-don't mention it... I'm just doing what I can.

Anyway, I gotta go, so take good care of the girls in there, okay?

I'm sure you can help them celebrate this festival without making a mess.

S.A.T.8: S-sure... I won't let you down!

...The Commander is gone.

S.A.T.8: Ugh... It's kinda embarrassing to have the Commander trust me so much.

S.A.T.8: I'm not actually that mature or dependable...

S.A.T.8: But to live up to the Commander's trust, I'd better work hard and do my best!

S.A.T.8: Alright, then let this little Halloween party begin!

S.A.T.8 strides confidently into the café.

Guys, I've brought these Commander-certified pumpkin pies for you!

Let's all have some together!
