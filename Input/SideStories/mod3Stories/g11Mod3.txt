416: What did you say?!

UMP45: While we're on break, I've commissioned Dier to give Gr G11 a neural upgrade.

UMP45: What, you've got a problem with that?

416: ...Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

UMP45: What's the big deal?

UMP45: When the upgrade is complete, she'll be able to operate independently. I thought you hated being treated as Gr G11's mom.

416: This is no laughing matter!

416: You know Gr G11's circumstances!

416: Her core module is extremely fragile to begin with! Forcing an upgrade on her will destroy her already rubbish neural cloud!

UMP45: The hardware just has to be replaced.

UMP45: And just to make it clear, I didn't skimp on this upgrade. It cost me a fortune.

416: Humph... You paid for it with the money withdrawn from Ange's account, didn't you?

UMP45: It's my money when it's in my hands.

416: I don't care whose money it is.

416: That's not the point. Don't change the subject.

UMP45: Don't you think she should have the ability to deal with problems on her own, especially after all the stuff we've been through?

UMP45: You're acting like an oversensitive tiger mom. It's unsightly.

416: I promised I'd protect her, so I can't let you mess around.

416: Besides, have you even asked Gr G11 about her opinion on the matter?

UMP45: She brought this up to me herself. She is very bothered by how easily Anna kidnapped her in the submarine base.

UMP45: She also believes it is her fault that she let Anna get captured at the Z-W Pharma office.

UMP45: She realizes how incompetent she is and wants to become stronger. Her exact words.

UMP45: Does that satisfy you?

416: ...Gr G11 brought this up herself?

416: How is that possible?

UMP45: You can make all the fuss you want, 416. However...

UMP45: Give Gr G11 some credit. She may be a useless sack of lazybones, but she is still a member of Squad 404.

UMP45: It's a good thing for all of us if she can carry her own weight.

416: ...You can't fool me with your fancy rhetoric. This isn't a decision you can make so lightly.

416: At least let me confirm her true intentions.

UMP45: She went to Dier this morning.

Slam!

Before UMP45 finishes her sentence, 416 has already sprinted out of the room.

UMP45: ...She always acts as if she'd like nothing more than to stuff Gr G11 into a garbage can.

UMP45: People who never say what they mean are such a pain...

UMP45 ponders the situation in silence for a while before strolling through the door at a leisurely pace.

She has an odd smile on her face, as if she's looking forward to something.

Gr G11: GUTEN TAG!

416: ...

UMP45: ...

Dier: ...

416: ...

Dier: Uh, why has Miss 416 crashed?

UMP45: Don't worry about her.

UMP45: ...Can you explain what's going on?

UMP45: If I remember correctly, I ordered a "neural upgrade", not a "neural refit".

UMP45: So who the hell is this?

Dier: This...this is Gr G11, of course!

Dier: The...The upgrade went fine!

Dier: Actually, you can even say it went extremely well...

UMP45: So what's the matter with her?

UMP45: Why is she behaving like a completely different person? What have you done to her?

Dier: Hm... It's a long story...

Dier: As you know, the fire-control core I've installed on Gr G11 has the best specs out of all the cores I have.

Dier: The reason she was always so lethargic was because the core was taking up too much of her power supply, which affected the performance of her other modules, especially her personality emulation module.

Dier: So after increasing the capacity of her neural storage, I've given her an external battery to keep up the power supply...

Dier: However...

Gr G11: Why are you all giving me weird looks?

Gr G11: The new Gr G11 is invincible!

Dier: However, now that she has an ample power supply, her original emulated personality from back when she was a civilian Doll seems to have resurfaced...

Dier: I'm guessing she used to be some kind of Domestic or Service Doll?

Gr G11: Stop mumbling! I can't hear you!

Gr G11: Have you not had enough to eat? Speak up!

Dier: Eeeep! Okay!

Gr G11: That's better! Now you sound alive!

UMP45: This is a completely different person...

UMP45: Is this level of gusto a requirement for Service Dolls?

Gr G11: You over there! No muttering—

UMP45: Come again?

Gr G11: ...Sorry, I forgot myself.

One glare from UMP45 is enough to shut Gr G11 up.

UMP45: Good. Almost got me worried that you'd switched neural clouds with some cheap maid.

UMP45: But you're still good old Gr G11.

UMP45: Now what's that thing under your ass? Are you sitting on a trash can?

Dier: That's the portable external battery that I told you about.

Dier: That's where Gr G11's power is coming from.

UMP45: ...But it's huge? And you have the nerve to call it "portable"?

UMP45: So now instead of one millstone on the battlefield, we'll have two?

UMP45: Gr G11 alone is enough of a pain.

Gr G11: Urk! How mean...!

Dier: Well, about that.

Dier: You don't have to worry at all!

Dier: I've found a permanent solution to this problem.

UMP45: Permanent solution?

Dier: Yep, I've run my calculations.

Dier: Go on, Gr G11. Show them what you've got!

Dier gestures for UMP45 to look.

Gr G11 leaps enthusiastically to her feet and starts jogging around the room with the battery in tow.

UMP45: ...This is your "permanent solution"?

Dier: Her body's physical strength has been greatly enhanced, so carrying the battery on her own is no big deal for her.

Dier: Her strength is guaranteed, her power supply is guaranteed; it won't be a problem even if she wants to become a marathon runner!

Gr G11: Heheh, Gr G11 is the best!

UMP45: Uh...

UMP45: I don't really have a problem as long as your performance has improved.

UMP45: 416, what do you think?

416: ...

UMP45: She's still frozen.

UMP45: Looks like you've given her quite a shock. Why don't you take care of her for a change?

Gr G11: Sure, leave it to me!

UMP45: But it'll be a pain to wake her up right now, so let's just leave her be.

UMP45: Gr G11, you can easily carry her on your back now, right?

Gr G11: Of course!

Hyah!

Gr G11 hoists 416 onto her back seemingly effortlessly, but the image looks a bit comical due to the difference in the two Dolls' physiques.

Even with 416 on her back and her battery trailing behind her, Gr G11 still looks perfectly uninhibited.

UMP45: ...

Gr G11: What?

Gr G11: Is something wrong?

UMP45: ...Nope.

UMP45: I suppose this is pretty neat.

UMP45: At least it's a moment worth documenting into my neural cloud.

Dier: You're very satisfied with my upgrade then!

Dier: So do you mind paying for this as well as what you still have on your tab—

Oof!

Dier: (Splutters)

Dier: P...Please don't elbow me...

UMP45: Whoops, sorry. My elbow just slipped because you looked so damn smug.

UMP45: I wonder, Dier, if humans and Dolls just think so differently.

UMP45: I never said I was satisfied with your upgrade~

UMP45: Leaving aside how strange you've made Gr G11, your masterpiece has caused 416 to crash.

UMP45: How much compensation should I demand from you?

UMP45: Hm?

UMP45: HM??

Dier: F...Fine...

Dier: Let's just put this on your tab as well...
Part 2

2

UMP9: Holy mother of...

UMP45: ...I've never seen our place so clean and tidy...

UMP45: Just look at the state of this basement. We might as well not be outlaws.

UMP9: This is an office that belongs to an A-list contractor!

UMP9: Who...Who did this?!

416: Who else could it be...?

416: Gr G11 has been bustling around ever since she returned from Dier's.

416: She all but tore up the entire building this afternoon. She couldn't even sit still for two minutes so I had to give her something to do.

UMP9: This... Wow...

UMP9: It's so unbelievable I don't even know what to say.

UMP9: Are you sure Dier didn't pull a switcheroo?

UMP9: Maybe he actually swapped Gr G11 with his own maid?

UMP45: I actually had the same suspicion, not gonna lie.

UMP45: Still, no other Doll could deliver that kind of performance.

UMP45: She was yammering at me to help her out with some target practice and she beat 416's records on everything – short-range, long-range, as well as marching fire.

UMP9: Wow, looks like Dier really did toss in his finest goods.

UMP9: The procedure must've cost a lot.

UMP45: Heheh, take a guess.

416: You scumbags must've bilked Dier again.

416: ...

416: She beat all my records...you say?

UMP45: Looks like you're taking it pretty hard.

UMP45: The next time we move out, have Gr G11 carry you back just like last time~

416: You!

416: Gr G11 got turned into a weirdo because all you cared about was boosting her specs!

UMP45: Hey, that was Dier's doing. I just wanted her to stop napping whenever she's idle.

416: But the end result is—

Gr G11: Time to clean!

Gr G11 suddenly barges into the room with a mop and a bucket of water.

UMP9: Huh? Didn't you do that just an hour ago?

Gr G11: But you've made the room dirty within the last hour!

Gr G11: Now get out and stay out of my way!

Gr G11 pushes the other Dolls out and slams the door in their faces.

The other Squad 404 members exchange looks.

416: ...Do you really think this is okay?

UMP45: What's the problem?

UMP45: Her change will definitely take some getting used to, but this is indeed Gr G11.

UMP45: I know what you're worried about, but it's not a bad thing for her to be more energetic.

UMP45: Besides, compared to a passive slacker, it's a lot more reassuring to have an eager and proactive Doll by our side when we're on missions.

416: From what I can see... Gr G11 wasn't ready yet. I've already told you many times.

416: There's no point in improving her specs if it means she becomes an entirely different person.

UMP45: When would she be ready, in your opinion?

UMP45: Or let me put this another way, 416.

UMP45: Who is to decide whether she's ready or not?

416: ...Not you, in any case.

UMP45: But it isn't you either.

416: I'm the one who knows her best. But surely you also know...

416: How she has suffered because of what she went through in the past?

UMP45: If you think she wasn't ready for the upgrade just because her body wasn't smashed to bits yet, then let me tell you—you are not protecting her; you're endangering her instead.

UMP45: I think you're just too prideful to swallow the fact that she has now surpassed you.

416: Don't be ridiculous!

UMP45: When Gr G11 got dragged away in the submarine base, where were you?

UMP45: Can you really keep her safe 24/7?

416: That was an unexpected incident... Plus, she's back unharmed, right?!

UMP45: You don't know she will always return unharmed. Not every time.

UMP45: What if next time, instead of Anna, an actual Nyto captures her?

UMP45: Will you be able to make it to her in time to save her?

416: I...

UMP45: Admit it. The only person she can ever count on is herself.

UMP45: With or without you, she must be capable of protecting herself.

UMP45: Even as a Doll, she can't stay a child forever. We can't make the same mistake twice. The world isn't so forgiving.

416: ...

416: ...I have nothing to say to you.

UMP45: That's because you know I'm right.

416 deliberates in silence for a while.

Then she opens the door without a word and enters the room in which Gr G11 is cleaning.

UMP45: Phew... Right, time to catch a breather.

UMP45: We old Dolls need our regular rest.

UMP45: Let's go, 9.

UMP9: Oh! Oh, okay...

UMP9: But is it really going to be alright?

UMP9: I'm actually also rather concerned about Gr G11...

UMP45: Stop being such a worrywart. We'll keep an eye on her.

UMP9: Hey, wait up, 45!

Gr G11: Ack! Didn't I tell you not to come in before I'm done?!

416: You've been messing around for a whole day. It's about time you settled down and started charging.

Gr G11: 416...

416: Hm?

Gr G11: You're actually telling me to go to bed...? Did you eat something that's gone bad?

416: Do you want to die?

Gr G11: Jeez... Don't be so snappy.

Gr G11: I was just kidding.

Gr G11: I don't really need to rest yet, and I've still got plenty of battery, so I should hurry up and finish the cleaning.

Gr G11 is scrubbing the door frame so hard she doesn't look like she's cleaning it.

She might as well be scraping off the top layer of the wood.

416: No...that's not what I mean.

416: You never even thought about doing the housework or anything else.

416: You're only doing this now because of the upgrade, aren't you?

416: I haven't got the chance to ask you—how are you feeling? Is anything bothering you?

Gr G11: Hmm...

Gr G11: Dammit... I didn't want to mention it, but...

Gr G11: I'm feeling extremely well...

Gr G11: Things feel so good it's almost painful...

Gr G11: No... Actually, it's not that painful...

Gr G11: I'm just...hm...not very used to it.

Gr G11: But these things take time, right?

416: ...

416: Just don't work yourself too hard.

416: If something feels off, go straight to Dier.

Gr G11: You're so kind today you don't seem like yourself at all...

Gr G11: Maybe I'm actually dying and I'm simply experiencing a moment of terminal lucidity?!

416: Unfortunately, judging by how energetic you are, you're gonna stick around for quite some time.

Gr G11: Ughhhhhhh.

Gr G11 lets out an exaggerated groan. Even her complaints sound more spirited than before.

But despite her verbal protests, her hands never stop cleaning.

416: ...

416: So why did you make that request?

Gr G11: Request?

416: Your request for a neural upgrade.

416: Did 45 force you to go through the procedure after all?

Gr G11: Well...

Gr G11 twists her towel with so much force a large amount of dirty water comes gushing out and the towel itself is starting to tear.

Gr G11: ...Why?

416: Why what?

Gr G11: Why do you think I wouldn't want the neural upgrade?

416: Why...? Do you even have to ask?

Gr G11: Oh, c'mon... I was just a bit of a slacker and a scaredy-cat, alright?

Gr G11 lets out a sigh but doesn't seem to have taken any offense.

Gr G11: Everyone else is getting stronger day by day.

Gr G11: It feels like I'm the only one being left behind...

Gr G11: If I keep slowing you guys down, you might actually leave me for good one of these days.

416: We will never do that.

Gr G11: Who knows?

Gr G11: After the neural upgrade was complete, I started recalling a lot of things in the past.

Gr G11: Back then, my original owner threw me out because I was too stupid and clumsy.

Gr G11: He also promised he wouldn't do that, you know.

416: ...

Gr G11: Anyway, the upgrade paid off!

Gr G11: My body feels so much lighter!

Gr G11: You're probably no match for me now!

Looking at Gr G11's current condition, 416 falls silent.

She isn't certain if this is a desirable outcome.

However, a vague sense of unease is nagging her in the back of her head.

...Perhaps she is actually mistaken?

416: ...You're right.

416: Your upgrade does seem to have gone well.

Gr G11: Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

416: That said, it's really infuriating when you speak to me in that tone.

Gr G11: Ow-ow-ow-ow I'm sorry I shouldn't have been so cocky!

Gr G11: Stop noogying me!

Gr G11: It hurts, it hurts!

Gr G11: Heeeeeeelp!!

As Gr G11 howls in pain, 416 decides that she will keep observing the situation for the time being.

...She never thought she would regret her decision so quickly.
Part 3

Gr G11: FWEEEEEEET!!

UMP45: ?!

UMP45: W-What's going on?!

UMP9: ...Leave me alone. It's 2am.

UMP9: I need more rest.

Gr G11: Up! Get up!!

Gr G11: Stop sleeping! Come and jog with me!

Gr G11: Exercise is life!

UMP9: Dolls don't really need sleep, but I do need to charge.

UMP9: And...did I hear you right?

UMP9: Did Gr G11 actually say, "exercise is life"...?

UMP45: You're gonna jog with this thingy here? I applaud your spirit... (Yawns)

UMP45: I don't care what you wanna do...just leave us out of it.

UMP45: Or I'll crack your head open like an egg.

UMP9: 45 is very cranky when she's sleep-deprived...

Gr G11: Ack! No need for that! But...

Gr G11: But running alone at night is scary, you know?!

UMP9: Also, I don't really see the point in jogging...

UMP9: Dolls don't need physical training.

UMP9: What purpose does it serve other than wasting energy?

Gr G11: But that's the point! There's no end to my energy!

Gr G11: I haven't slept in almost a week!

Gr G11: Arghhh... I'm so damn sprightly...

UMP9: How can you say something so sprightly in such an unsprightly way...

UMP9: ...Wait, you still haven't used up all your battery even after doing so much stuff this week?

Gr G11: Was it that much?

Gr G11: My workload was much heavier back when I was a civilian Doll!

UMP45: Isn't that a good thing? At least it proves that I haven't been working you like a slave.

UMP45: Now pipe down. We still need our beauty sleep even if you don't.

Gr G11: No way!

Gr G11: We've had no work for the whole week; you must have enough battery for at least a jog!

45 and 9 ignore Gr G11's protests and lie back down without a second thought.

416: ...

416: I never thought I'd see this day coming.

Gr G11: 416!

Gr G11: Uh... Will you go jogging with me?

416: ...

416: ...I know this isn't just a matter of you being diligent.

416: You're about to overload, aren't you?

Gr G11: Huh...? Do I look like I'm gonna overload?

Gr G11: I feel pretty good though?

416: You call this pretty good?

416: Not only are you on the verge of an overload, you're probably not far from conking out altogether.

416 tugs the cable connecting Gr G11 to her external battery.

Her cold voice is dripping with disapproval.

416: You've been darting around like a bird even with this load.

416: It's been almost a week, but you aren't even remotely tired.

416: Do you really think this is normal?

Gr G11: ...

416: Gr G11, the reason why you're so hyperactive is because an excessive amount of power is overclocking your body.

416: That kind of stress must be excruciating. That's why you've been doing whatever you can to expend the extra energy.

416: I now understand completely. You are not ready for this, Gr G11.

416: Unplug yourself from that thing.

Gr G11: I...

Gr G11: I don't want to.

Gr G11 looks unusually determined.

UMP45 seems to have shifted next to them.

The rustling of her clothes is the only sound in the silence.

416: Why?

Gr G11: I think...

Gr G11: Things are pretty good the way they are...

Gr G11: Even though I can't sleep...

Irritation fills 416 as she takes in Gr G11's shifty eyes.

But a line of reason within tells her that agitating Gr G11 is not a smart course of action.

416: You're lying. This isn't you at all.

416: What secret are you keeping?

416: In the past week...

416: You've been cleaning the place and handling the chores like a professional cleaner.

416: I get it now... Didn't you say you've been remembering your past? That's what this is about, isn't it?

Gr G11: 416... I...

416: You think we're like your past owners?

416: You think we'd dump you if you didn't do all this work? Is that it?

Gr G11: No!

Gr G11: I-I just...

Gr G11: I just want to make myself useful...!

416: Oh, is that so? You think this is good, eh?

416: You'd rather let memories of those bastards plague you and all that excessive power wear down your hardware...

416: Than unplug yourself from that damn battery box, huh?

416: Fine, do as you wish. I don't care anymore.

Gr G11: 416...

Unsure what else to do, 416 stomps out of the room and slams the door behind her without a backward glance.

Gr G11: ...

...

The next morning, the three Dolls awake from their sleep as sunlight shines in through the speckless window.

While 416 is rubbing the sleep from her face, UMP45 comes to stand in front of her with a thoughtful look on her face.

UMP45: You know what? I'm starting to think you weren't entirely wrong.

UMP45 says without any preface.

416: About about?

UMP45: Gr G11.

UMP45: It looks like an addiction.

UMP45: She is ready to keel over any second but she just won't let it go.

UMP45: At this rate, I don't know what's going to happen to her.

416: ...Why didn't you say anything last night?

UMP45: I was actually charging, unlike you guys.

UMP45: My battery was almost depleted, but I did some thinking while I was charging up.

UMP45: Your conversation seemed to have gone swimmingly, but it's come to a point where I must interfere.

416: ...You heard us?

UMP45: A little. I'm not in the habit of eavesdropping.

416: That's got to be the joke of the year.

416: ...So what do you think? Is her abnormal behavior caused by a power overload?

UMP45: Not exactly.

UMP45: Dier may be a prick, but his workmanship is peerless.

UMP45: He won't make such a stupid mistake, at least not a second time.

UMP45: He must have replaced all of Gr G11's hardware and made sure they could withstand this level of strain.

UMP45: The only other thing that can be damaged by a power overload...

416: ...Her neural cloud?!

416: Past memories started resurfacing due to her neural cloud being overclocked.

416: That's a warning sign that something's wrong with her neural cloud, is that what you mean?!

UMP45: Maybe. It's just a guess though.

UMP45: And I only thought of it this morning.

416: I hope you step on dog turd.

UMP45: But don't worry, Gr G11 is still able to prevent an overload for the time being by keeping herself busy.

UMP45: I'll get in touch with Dier and put an end to this before it's too late.

416: Then I'll keep an eye on Gr G11...

416: If she keeps up her cleaning spree, she'll turn our hideout into a five-star hotel.

UMP45: I suddenly think we can hold off on contacting Dier.

416: Hey.

UMP9: 4-4-45!

UMP45: What's up with the stutter?

UMP45: What's got you in such a panic?

UMP9: Gr G11 is gone!

416: ...What?

UMP9: She...left this.

UMP9 holds out a piece of paper.

The chicken scratch on it is definitely scrawled in Gr G11's hand.

416: ...

UMP45: What did she say?

416: She said...she'd be back after she's done letting out her pent-up energy.

UMP9: Wow... Hard-working doesn't even begin to describe her.

UMP9: Is this really the Gr G11 that I know?

416: Where is she planning to do that?

UMP45: Her gun isn't here.

416: ...!

416 suddenly grabs UMP45 by the collar.

416: ...Now what? This is all your fault!

UMP45: ...Actually, Dier has given me a GPS tracker.

UMP45: We can locate her external battery with this.

416: Give it to me.

416 snatches the tracker from UMP45. She then releases UMP45 and grabs her own weapon.

UMP45: 416.

416: ...What?

UMP45: Have you ever thought about why Gr G11 would rather do all this crazy stuff than just unplug herself and be done with it?

416: ...Because she doesn't want us to get rid of her?

UMP45: On the contrary, 416.

UMP45: She knows we won't get rid of her. That's why she's saving us the trouble.

416: ...

UMP45: She is not a child. She is a Tactical Doll of Squad 404.

416: I understand.

416 pauses briefly.

416: I will confront her as a Tactical Doll.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

???: I will protect you.

Gr G11: ...

Gr G11: You are not defined by what you do...Gr G11.

Gr G11 mutters to herself as she fires a shot to her side without turning her head.

The bullet penetrates the head of a Sangvis unit that just poked out of a bush, and destroys it.

She has never felt so clear-headed.

No weakness, no blind spots.

Gr G11: ...

She marches on in the snow, lugging the bulky external battery along, but it doesn't slow her down at all.

Her surroundings are littered with remains of Sangvis units.

One shot, one kill; not one is spared.

She is wide awake. Things have never felt so sharp and crystal clear.

She knows she should fear this. She knows herself. She's not cut out for this at all.

Gunning her way through a Sangvis army on her own?

She must've gone crazy...

Gr G11: I'm exhausted... I wanna sleep...

She's lying.

She isn't tired at all.

Well, she is, but not physically.

She thought fighting would help wear her out.

However, power is being pumped continuously into her body from the external battery.

Will she go on like this forever?

She's been through something similar before.

The last time she walked down a road on her own like this, she thought she would meet her end in the gloomy rain.

Gr G11: Argh... So tiresome.

...But she didn't.

Back then...she ran into the unreasonable person who ended up dragging her off that path.

Gr G11: ...

Sangvis Ferri has all but dissolved. Even though she has barged into their stronghold, there are only stragglers wandering around aimlessly.

The energy needed to kill them is negligible to Gr G11 in her current state.

???: ...

As Gr G11 breaks into tears, a familiar figure draws near in the snow.

Gr G11: (Sobs)

Gr G11: Am I dreaming?

???: ...Do Dolls dream?

Gr G11: I slept a lot...

Gr G11: But I've never dreamt...

Gr G11: Uh... Or maybe I have?

???: You have? What did you dream about?

Gr G11: I think I ran into...people who were very important to me.

Gr G11: They wouldn't complain no matter how much I slept...

???: ...Who said they wouldn't complain?

Gr G11's eyes narrow.

They zero in on the figure—the unreasonable person standing in front of her.

Her past is standing right there.

Her future, too.

Gr G11: 416...

416: ...What?

Gr G11: I want to sleep...

416: Sure. Pull the plug.

Gr G11: Do I have to?

416: Yes.

416: ...

416: Pull it out and say goodbye to your past.

Gr G11: I don't know...

Gr G11: Can I really do that?

Gr G11: I honestly don't know what to do.

Gr G11: 416... If these things hadn't started coming back to me, I wouldn't be thinking about such matters.

Gr G11: But if I let them all go...

Gr G11: Will I still be me?

Gr G11: Will I turn into a brand new Gr G11 just by getting rid of all these painful memories?

Gr G11: I thought there's no such thing as a free lunch.

416: Well...

416 lifts her weapon.

416: You seem pretty energetic.

416: Fight me.

Gr G11: Huh?

Gr G11: B-But why?

Gr G11: How did our conversation lead to this?!

416: Because I'm extremely pissed right now.

Gr G11: You're just looking for an excuse to beat me up!

Gr G11: I'm weak and helpless...!

Bang!

416's muzzle flashes.

A bullet grazes the hem of Gr G11's coat and accurately pierces the head of a Sangvis unit that was trying to sneak up on Gr G11.

416: Is target practice using this kind of junk any help in depleting your excess energy?

Gr G11: ...

416: Or do you think I'm not up to the task either?

416: So you've met a Doll stronger than me?

Gr G11: No!

Gr G11: ...You're the strongest T-Doll I've ever known.

416: Listen, Gr G11.

416: I understand what silly ideas you've got tumbling in your head. Now you listen to me.

416: I WILL pull that plug for you even if I have to do it by force.

416: If you want to stop me, you'll have to fight me like you mean it, got it?

Gr G11: That's just like you... Ever the bully…

416: Your past does not concern me a single bit.

416: We are Squad 404. Our past is blank. We do not exist.

416: There is no reason why you should be an exception.

Gr G11: Why are you always such a pain...

Whoosh!

Before Gr G11 can finish complaining, 416 has already closed in on her in the blink of an eye.

With the massive and bulky external battery, Gr G11 is less agile than 416.

Clang!

Their barrels collide with a clang. Gr G11 feels a chill as her back is exposed.

Gr G11: Huh? You're serious?!

416: Do I look like I'm joking?

416 reaches for Gr G11's cable.

Gr G11: W-Wait!

Bang!

416: !

When Gr G11 isn't forced to move from her spot, she is no less vigorous than 416.

416 prides herself on her physical aptitude, but even she finds Gr G11 a formidable opponent.

Right now, 416 is thoroughly convinced.

This Gr G11 is indeed the Gr G11 of Squad 404.

Gr G11: (Pants)

Gr G11: I told you... Hold on for a sec.

Gr G11: At least give me some time to think about it!

416: I don't have the patience.

Gr G11: Just stop and listen to what I have to say!

Gr G11: You nasty old hag!

416: Nasty old—?!

416: ...Is that how you talk to me now?

416: You've got some gall.

416: Now you've just made this personal!

Gr G11: So what?!

Gr G11: You're always punching me and kicking me! You're a Dummkopf!

416: I'm. Telling. You. Don't get too full of yourself!

The two Dolls tumble around in the snow, locked in a scuffle.

Both have seemingly thrown their dignity to the wind and resorted to exchanging blows.

This has turned into...a petty brawl.

UMP45: ...

UMP9: 45... Shouldn't we stop them?

UMP45: No need for that.

UMP45: They look perfectly fine to me.

UMP45: And now we have something to tease 416 about, so what's the problem?

UMP9: Heh... I can't say I'd win myself.

UMP9: There's nothing humiliating about losing to Gr G11.

UMP45: That's not what I mean.

UMP45 snorts in laughter as she watches the two tussling Dolls.

UMP45: It's just that elite Dolls aren't all that different from us after all.

UMP9: But of course!

UMP9: 416 is our friend!

UMP9 declares happily.

UMP45: You're right...

UMP45: And so is Gr G11.

Dier: ...

Dier: ...Say, is this why you've kidnapped me and brought me here? To make me watch this?

Dier: A...ATCHOO!

Dier: This is no fun at all!

UMP45: If you don't solve Gr G11's issue, I will tie you up and throw you at the Sangvis goons.

UMP45: That will certainly be fun.

Dier: This is outrageous!

Dier: I am going to file a complaint! And I'm requesting additional payment—

UMP45: ...You dare talk to me about payment?

Dier: ...Ahem.

Dier: Right, it-it's all included in the after-sales service, hahaha.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Just out of curiosity, you're not in the habit of exploiting the Gr G11 who works as your maid, are you?

Dier: Huh? Don't be ridiculous!

Dier: I never give her any heavy work!

UMP45: Really...?

Dier: W-What's this all about?

UMP45: Nothing...

Dier: ...?

...

The fracas goes on for an entire hour.

In the end, with both sides utterly drained and exhausted, 416 defeats Gr G11.

Gr G11: Ughhh...

Gr G11: I'm dog-tired...

Gr G11: For real, this time...

Gr G11 is sprawled on the snow, too worn out to stand.

416: What a nuisance... That settles it, then.

Gr G11: Yeah... I knew it...

416: You knew what?

Gr G11: Running into you wasn't a dream.

416: ...Dolls don't dream.

Gr G11: 416...

416: What now?

Gr G11: Don't forget...to carry me home...

416: ...

416 walks up to Gr G11 in silence and seizes the cable connecting her to the external battery.

416: I won't haul this back for you.

Gr G11: Zzzzzzzzz...

The moment 416 pulls the plug, Gr G11 falls into a deep sleep.

UMP45: Beautifully done, elite Doll!

UMP45: It took so long even for you to subdue Gr G11! And you did it in a melee!

UMP45: I expected nothing less!

416: Shut up.

416 wordlessly hoists Gr G11 onto her back.

416: So what are you going to do about this thing?

Dier: From what I can see...there's nothing wrong with the upgrade I performed. It's actually more successful than I expected.

Dier: The only fault is with the battery source. It's a little too powerful.

UMP45: Can't you take out some parts?

Dier: I can change it to a smaller battery.

UMP45: But what are we going to do about the huge case?

Dier: Uh... Switching out the battery will free up almost half of the space.

Dier: We can leave it for Gr G11 to store her luggage.

Dier: Isn't she always moaning about wanting to bring her pillow along?

UMP45: ...

Dier: I'll also put in an additional switch. She can activate the extra energy input during battle and return to her usual self afterwards.

UMP45: Her usual self?

Dier: To be honest... She's been driving both Sier and I up the wall in the past week.

Dier: She's like a mother, fretting over every little thing and even snatching work out of my maid's hands.

Dier: I suspect it's got something to do with her original neural cloud design... In any case, she's way more adorable the way she is right now.

416: ...That's true.

416 studies Gr G11's sleeping profile in silence.

UMP45: Will this episode cause any lasting damage to her?

Dier: ...Hm, hard to say.

UMP45: What would your sister say if you unfortunately went missing here?

Dier: H-Hold on, let me finish!

Dier: I can't promise it won't have any effect on her, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!

Dier: The overload has caused some of her buried memories to resurface, so some of her old habits might stick.

Dier: What I mean is...she might do some chores around the house or something?

416: ...

UMP45: Feels like your little girl is all grown up, doesn't it?

416: Shut it.

UMP45: Alright, alright.

UMP45: Let's head home then, Mutti.

416: Who are you calling ... Nevermind.

416 stumbles a little as she carries Gr G11.

UMP9: Whoa, gotta be careful~

UMP9, who has been observing them gleefully, rushes up to help.

Dier: ...

Dier: Wait, am I supposed to drag this thing back with me?

UMP45: Duh?

Dier: But I'm human!

UMP45: So?

Dier: ...

UMP45: Looks like you don't have a problem with that. Lovely.

UMP45: Please take care of it then.

UMP45: I'll swing by to examine the goods in two days. Make sure you don't mess up again.

UMP45: Otherwise, even if I let you off the hook...

UMP45: 416 will still dismember you, you hear?

UMP45: You saw how scary she is when she's angry, didn't you?

Dier: ...A-Alright, I get it!

UMP45: Heheh~

UMP45 trails behind her three teammates.

From this angle, she can see Gr G11's profile.

It seems like ages ago since she last saw her sleeping so peacefully.
