Soldier A: Over here! One of them slipped the net!

Soldier B: Don't think you can escape!

M500: ...

M500: Hehe...you fell for it.

M500: Don't think you'll get me so easily.

M500: This is the difference in our experience as hunters; a moment's carelessness and you become the prey instead.

M500: By which I mean this!

Soldier A: What...? She's behind—!

Bang!

M500: (Pants)

Soldier B: Over there!

M500: Are there more of them?

M500: Good grief... Give me a break, will you...?

At the Griffin training ground.

M500: Go hunting with me!

M590: ...This is too sudden, 500. I can't decide until you tell me more about it.

These are memories from a long time ago, from the days in Griffin.

M590: I think I roughly get what you mean. You're talking about training, right?

M500: Yup! But hunting is hunting, you know!

M590: I don't quite understand.

M590: Training refers to simulation training, doesn't it? Besides, I don't think any real hunting preserves still exist.

M590: But since we're using VR training technology, why go out of your way to train yourself through hunting?

M500: ...

M590: You don't understand my question, do you...

M590: Alright, start from the beginning then, 500.

M500: Yup!

M500: Remember how some time ago, someone discovered you could use the simulator to mock up a virtual game park?

M500: We all got into it right away.

M500: Then more and more people started taking part, so we've decided to set up a competition!

M590: You skipped quite a lot in your explanation...but I understand now.

M590: Are you going to take part in the competition, 500?

M500: Yup!

M590: Hunting, huh... I'm not very interested.

M590: Why don't you take part by yourself? You don't need a team for this, right?

M500: We're all joining as individuals!

M590: Then there's even less reason to bring me along.

M590: It looks like you really enjoy this sort of thing.

M500: Because hunting is really fun!

M590: What exactly is fun about it?

M590: I don't understand. Aren't small animals nothing but moving targets?

M590: In that case, wouldn't a target drone be more efficient?

M500: Hehehe...you just don't get it, M590!

M590: ...I never thought the day would come when you'd look down on me.

M500: What we call "hunting" isn't the simple murder of small animals!

M500: That sort of court entertainment can't be considered hunting, it's nothing more than playing with guns!

M500: Real hunting is a deep and profound thing!

M590: Is that so?

M590: That said, I still don't quite understand, even with your explanation. Could you tell me how it is deep and profound?

M500: No problem! Hunting is...

M500: ...

M500: ...Woof!

M590: Huh?

M500: It...it's a pooch! 590, come look, it's a pooch!

Puppy: Awoo...

M590: Aw, was he abandoned? The poor dear...

M590: He looks very healthy, so I don't think he's sick. That said, he must be starving.

M500: Hahaha, don't lick my face~

M590: ...So she's already forgotten what she was going to say?

M590: Oh well, that works too.

M500: 590! Can I keep him? I can keep him, right?

...
Part 2

Soldier A: She should be close. All units, keep your eyes peeled in case you get ambushed.

Soldier B: Relax, we've started closing the net, there's no way the rabbit will escape.

Soldier A: The trail ends here... Hey, come over and take a look.

Soldier B: Huh, that would hurt if you stepped into it. Simple traps like this are easy to make, but still very useful.

Soldier A: So that civilian Doll made them?

Soldier B: Dolls are Dolls. She was just naive, thinking that she could trick human eyes with camouflage like this.

Soldier A: A rabbit would have fallen for it, though.

Soldier B: Since she set a trap here, that must mean she's hiding over there.

Soldier B: Hurry up and get rid of her, we've wasted enough time as it is and we need to catch up with the others.

Soldier A: Roger!

Soldier A: ...Wait a minute, what's that by your foot?

Soldier B: Th-that's—

Soldier B: Crap! The trap just now was a deco—!

BOOOOM!

M500: Ugh... Did I only manage to get one of them?

M500: Guess I can't take them too lightly...

???: Awoo...

M500: Don't worry, "Dowel"...

M500: It takes a patient hunter to catch the prey...

In the Griffin base.

M500: So the most important quality a hunter can have is patience.

M500: Am I right, "Dowel"?

"Dowel": Arf!

M590: Patience?

M500: That's right, patience!

M500: A true hunter doesn't always run into prey.

M500: Even when you do, there's no telling what kind of terrain you'll find yourself in.

M500: You need to wait patiently, move when you have to, and pick the right moment to act.

M500: That's what it means to be an excellent hunter!

M590: For some reason, none of that seems to apply to you.

M590: But in the end you still registered for that competition, didn't you?

M500: That...that...that's because it's a hunting competition!

???: It's the "Griffin Dolls' Hunting Association Friendly Competition".

M590: Miss Honey Badger.

Honey Badger: Good evening, M590.

M500: Enemy sighted!

Honey Badger: Come on, it's not like I'm an enemy, am I...

M590: Are you taking part in the competition too, Miss Honey Badger?

Honey Badger: I suppose, although my weapon isn't suited for hunting.

Honey Badger: Still, I think I can enjoy the process.

M590: Regardless of what 500 says, the fact that even you say so is quite interesting.

M500: Hey! Don't just dismiss my opinion!

Honey Badger: I believe you should be quite suited to it as well, M590.

Honey Badger: Granted, many people have a poor impression of hunting.

Honey Badger: However, it was only after I took it up that I realized there's a surprising amount of depth to it.

Honey Badger: It is also very helpful for combat.

M500: Yup yup!

M590: You probably just think it's fun, 500...

Honey Badger: Hunting requires you to consider the same things that you would think about on the battlefield.

Honey Badger: Shooting skills alone are only the foundation. You must build much, much more upon them.

Honey Badger: For instance, how to track highly-alert beasts, how to interpret animal tracks, the choice of rounds, and where to aim when shooting.

Honey Badger: In addition, you must also learn how to make traps and camouflage them, and you can expect to spend two to three days in the wild if a hunt drags on for too long. It is a great test of your physical stamina.

M590: I see... That does sound quite complex.

M590: I'm impressed that you managed to figure all that out, 500.

M500: Hehe... Aw, you don't have to praise me like that.

Honey Badger: In M500's case... She's not so much a veteran hunter, but more of someone who acts on instinct all the time...

Dowel: Arf!

Pett: ...

Honey Badger: Is he your partner?

Honey Badger: I see, he looks very talented.

Honey Badger: But he looks a little skinny, have you been feeding him properly?

M500: Dowel is still growing, he'll grow super fast!

M590: "Partner?"

M590: What are you talking about, Miss Honey Badger?

Honey Badger: A hunting partner, of course.

Honey Badger: Our rules are quite strict; all hunters can only take part in the competition if they bring a hunting companion of their own.

Honey Badger: After all, this isn't just simple hunting but a form of training.

M590: I see, so that's why M500 made such a fuss about adopting Dowel...

M500: ...

M590: ...You didn't forget about that, did you, 500?

Honey Badger: ...Let me get this out of the way first; a Doll without a hunting partner can't take part in the competition.

Dowel: Arf?
Part 3

M500: (Groans) This is bad.

Soldier A: Hold it right there!

M500: It's not like I can stop here, can I?!

Bang!

Dowel: Awoo!

Soldier A: Ow ow ow... Let go of me, you mangy mutt!

M500: Well done, buddy!

Bang!

M500: (Pants heavily)

M500: Let's go, we need to get out of here ASAP. That gunshot is going to draw more people.

Dowel: Grrrr...

M500: Oh, don't menace the corpse.

M500: That was close... They'd have scrapped me if it hadn't been for you.

M500: Well done!

Dowel: Arf!

M500: You have really come a long way since back then!

In the Griffin base.

M500: Jump, Dowel! Jump!

Dowel: Awooooo...

M590: Maybe you're pushing him too hard? This obstacle is too high.

M500: But if even this is too much for him, we won't be able to join the competition.

M590: Personally, I think Dowel is pretty gifted... Did you see how high he jumped just now?

M590: Not long ago, he was just a bag of bones on the verge of starving to death.

M500: Hmm... I guess I was too hard on you, huh...

Dowel: Awoo!

M500: Alright! Time for a break!

M590: The standards are high, but your teaching method is so lax...

M590: Are you serious about training him?

M500: It's alright, it's alright... You don't need to push yourself too hard, Dowel.

M590: Say...

M590: Don't tell me you just want Dowel to make up numbers?

M590: As in, you'll handle the competition by yourself once he qualifies for it?

M500, who has bent down to pat Dowel, flinches very unnaturally.

M500: J-jeez... You're such a kidder, 590...

M590: I'm right, aren't I?

M590 questions M500 in a slightly baleful tone.

M500: I'm sorry...

M590: Goodness... You're the one taking part in the competition, and I'm also an amateur at this.

M590: So I'm not really in any position to lecture you.

M590: But I think what you're doing is very unfair to Dowel, 500.

M500: It'll be fine, Dowel's just small for now.

M500: Besides, I don't actually expect him to make himself useful; all he has to do is tag along while I win the championship!

M500: That way Dowel will be happy too! Am I right, Dowel?

Dowel: Awoo...

M590: You...

M590: ...I'll admit, you're a more capable hunter than I am.

M590: But even an amateur like me knows that all rules exist for a reason.

M590: For instance, looking down on the opposition might come back to bite you in the ass later on.

M500: No, it won't! I'm really good at this!

M590: Honestly...you're not listening at all.

M590: Still, that's just the way you are.

Honey Badger: Oh, looks like the training is going well.

M590: Ah, Miss Honey Badger.

Honey Badger: I've come to see how things are going. After all, M500 is a pretty popular contestant among us.

Honey Badger: Is that military dog your partner?

Honey Badger: He looks a little skinny, but there's a lot of spirit in his eyes.

Honey Badger: Isn't that right, Pett?

M590: Well, you call him a military dog...but he's just the stray you saw last time.

Honey Badger: Ehhhh? Seriously? He looks completely different!

M590: Does he look so different to you?

Honey Badger: Maybe you've been watching as he grew every day, that's why you don't notice the change.

Honey Badger: To me, he looks like a completely different dog.

M590: Hm... It seems you've been working harder than I imagined, Dowel.

Honey Badger: That said, Pett and I won't lose.

Honey Badger: It's plain to see there's no coordination between M500 and her partner.

Honey Badger: If a hunter and her hound don't work as one, their prey is going to run circles around them.

M590: So even a pro like you agrees, huh?

M590: 500 isn't the least bit serious about making Dowel her partner. She's planning to win by herself.

M590: Don't you think she's taking the whole thing too lightly?

Honey Badger: Absolutely.

Honey Badger: As I've said before, she might be a pro, but she's merely working off her hunter's instincts...

Honey Badger: Let's put it another way - imagine M500 were on the battlefield and she said, "I don't need M590 or the Commander, I can handle the mission all by myself."

Honey Badger: What would you think, Miss M590?

Honey Badger: She'll understand once she starts struggling during the competition.

Honey Badger: Being a hunter is a lot more difficult than she thinks.

M590: Do you want to see her struggle that badly, Miss Honey Badger?

Honey Badger: No, that's not what I meant, so don't get all serious on me! Honestly, you dote on her too much.

Honey Badger: I'm just saying that it would do her good if she could see her shortcomings during training.

Honey Badger: Also...

M500: Dowel! Arf!

Dowel: Arf!

Honey Badger: ...I might sound like a big shot, but even I have to admit...

Honey Badger: M500 is the greatest hunter I've ever seen.

Honey Badger: Which is precisely why...I must put in everything I have.

Honey Badger: And I'll think of a way to make her even better too.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

Honey Badger: Got it! Well done, Pett!

M500: Uwaaaaah! She pulled ahead again! What's going on!

Honey Badger: How many times have I told you... Don't just rely on yourself.

Honey Badger: You'll never be a good hunter if you can't even trust your partner!

M500: Dammit...

M500: At this rate, she'll leave us in the dust!

Dowel: Awoo...

In the intense battle between M500 and Honey Badger, in stark contrast to the seamless coordination displayed by Honey Badger and Pett...

Dowel is having a hard time just keeping up with M500.

M500: I need to think of something...

M500 has the highest qualifications to be a hunter.

Her sense of smell, her agility, her patience, all of them are on the level of a top-class hunter.

M500: It can't be helped!

Dowel: Arf! Arf!

Honey Badger: W-wait a minute! That's too far in! You can't go in there!

M500: But that's where the big prey are—

Honey Badger: Heyyy—

...

???: Awoo...

M500: Ugh.. Oh...I must have passed out...

Dowel: Arf!

M500: Ah... I was dreaming about the past.

Dowel: Arf, arf!

M500: Sorry...lend me a hand...

M500: Ugh!

M500 rises shakily to her feet from behind a log and carefully peers towards the other side.

Masking her presence from the alert senses of her prey is a basic skill for a hunter.

She watches the armored troopers, who are still trying to locate her, and silently counts them.

M500: Five...six...

M500: There's seven more of them...

Dowel: Arf!

M500: Shh.

M500 tenderly pats her beloved hound on the head.

M500: Comms are down, I can't contact the others...

M500: I wonder if 590 managed to retreat...

Her ammunition is almost depleted and her body is in bad shape.

As a member of the covering party, M500's job is to make sure the other team members manage to successfully evacuate.

But at this point, she's having a hard time just keeping herself safe.

M500: Listen to me, Dowel.

Dowel: Arf?

M500: I don't think I'll be able to make it back... I'm going to think of a way to take care of the seven of them.

M500: You need to run back, got it?

Dowel: Arf—!

M500: Listen!

M500 takes a deep breath.

M500: Before the battle started...our neural clouds were all backed up with Miss Dandelion, so it doesn't matter if I die here.

M500: But you're not the same, Dowel. If you die...

M500: I'll be without a partner forever.

Dowel: Awoo...

M500: ...Do you remember that hunting competition?

M500: I went too far in and ended up falling into a crevasse.

M500: The Commander couldn't find me, and if you hadn't brought the others along, I'd have been doomed for sure.

Dowel: Au?

M500: You are a precious friend.

M500 hugs Dowel, now a mighty military dog, and breaks into a smile

M500: ...So when you go back and see "me", make sure you tell her everything we did on the battlefield.

Dowel: ...Arf!

Dowel licks the dust off M500's face, his tail sweeping the ground.

He runs two circles around M500 and rubs up against M500's legs.

He simply refuses to leave.

M500: ...

M500 cocks her weapon. Then with her back pressed against her cover, she sits down.

M500: Go! NOW!

Dowel: Oo...au!

M500's anger makes Dowel flinch. He shakes his head as he looks at his mistress.

In the end, he reluctantly turns away and runs to the other end of the battlefield.

M500: ...Only a hunter who knows works as one with their partner can be considered a good hunter.

M500: The way you've scattered yourselves makes you nothing but prey.

—And a good hunter will always trust her partner.

M500: Commander, Dowel, 590, we're going to win!

Bang—!

...

...

Dowel: Arf!

Dowel: Arf! Arf!

M590: Dowel? Dowel?

M590: Now where did he run off to...

M500: Quit licking my face— It's really ticklish! Hahahaha—!

M590: ...Ah, there you are.

M590: So that's where you've been hiding.

M590: I couldn't find you at the training ground, I was wondering what happened to you.

M500: Heh, we went a bit too far. Sorry, 590.

M500: I haven't had so much fun in a while.

Dowel: Arf! Awoooo!

M500: There, good boy, goooood boy.

M500: You're all grown up now.

M590: And he's become very close to you.

M500: That's hardly surprising.

M500: We're partners, after all.

M500: Am I right, Dowel?!

Dowel: Awooo!

M590: He's all grown up, huh...

M590: That's true.

M590: And it isn't just Dowel, you've grown a lot too, 500.

M500: Of course!

M500: There's no prey we can't catch as long as we're together—

M500: We're the best team, after all!

Dowel: Au!

M500: Right, let's go, Dowel! Let's go practice again!

M500: This time, we'll win for sure!

M590: Wait, wait a minute...

M590: Ah...she's gone.

M590: She's always running around and making a fuss like that.

M590: Though it's not a bad thing, right...?

M590: (Sighs) Forget it, then.

M590: In any case, it's good to see 500 being her usual self.

M590: It makes you feel like everything's going back to normal.

M590: Isn't that right, Dowel?

Dowel: Awooooooo—
