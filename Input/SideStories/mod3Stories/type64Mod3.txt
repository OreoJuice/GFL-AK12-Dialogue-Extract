Type 97S: Hey, isn't that 64? Where are you going?

Type 64: Oh, nice to meet you, Miss Hawk.

Type 64: I was just about to head to the kitchen.

Type 97S: The kitchen?

Type 97S: Aiya...there's only one thing you could be after if you're going there...

Type 97S: Do you have goodies in that box of yours?

Type 64: Well...

Type 97S: Quit beating around the bush! Hurry up and tell me!

Type 97S: I won't let you go until you do!

Type 64: Mm...

Type 64: Do you remember the resupply we got several days ago?

Type 64: This is some of the fresh meat that was left over after the supplies were allocated.

Type 64: Class Rep asked me to make lapcheungs out of it so it would last longer.

Type 97S: What?! It's one thing to make them into lapcheungs, but having you do it?

Type 97S: No way!

Type 97S: How could Class Rep make that decision on her own?! I'm going to find her!

Type 64: But Miss Hawk...

Type 97S: Deciding how to handle leftover meat ought to be done through a democratic vote!

Type 97S: 64, put the meat in the fridge first, we'll go find Class Rep together!

Type 97S: Class Rep! Class Reeeeeep!

M99: What's all this racket...

M99: What's the matter, Hawk?

Type 64: Class Rep, I tried my best to stop Hawk, but she insisted on looking for you...

Type 97S: Class Rep, is it true that you asked 64 to make lapcheungs?!

M99: Yes, I did. They'll keep for longer and they're more convenient to carry on missions. Is there a problem?

Type 97S: 64's lapcheungs are salty! How many people other than you and 64 like that taste?

Type 97S: Did you ask the rest of us when you made that decision?

Type 97S: Our squad agreed beforehand that we would vote on any issues which concerned the interests of the group!

M99: It's just some leftover meat, is it really such a big deal...?

Type 97S: What do you mean by "just some leftover meat"?!

Type 97S: It's MEAT, a rare provision we only get every fortnight!

M99: But you had a big meal just now, so why are you so hung up on that...

Type 64: Precisely, Miss Hawk... Please don't make things difficult for the Class Rep.

Type 97S: Class Rep, are you saying you intend to overthrow our democracy because of your selfish desire for salty lapcheungs?

M99: Is there a need to make such a mountain out of a molehill...?

M99: And while I DO like salty lapcheungs, I only suggested that for the ease of preservation...

Type 64: Since Miss Hawk's so adamant on it, why don't we gather everyone for a vote, Class Rep?

M99: ...Eh, sure.

One hour later.

M99: The results of the vote are an even split when you include mine.

Type 97S: We of the sweet sausage faction won't give in so easily.

M99: I just knew it'd end up this way...

M99: Therefore, in keeping with our squad's traditions, we will settle this through a trial by combat.

Type 64: ...A-a duel again?

Type 97S: Hehe, backing out then, Milady?

Type 64: While I don't like exerting myself...

Type 64: But since this is what Class Rep has decided, I'll do my best too!

...That afternoon, all the Dolls take part in an exercise in the practice yard.

Type 64: ...I'm so tired.

Type 64: I'm not good at athletic endeavors after all.

M99: 64, are you alright?

Type 64: I'm fine, Class Rep. I'm just a little sore because I tripped and fell just now.

Type 64: Is the exercise over?

M99: Yes...

M99: 64, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

M99: You won't be able to make salty lapcheungs this time...

Type 64: I see... Is it because our team lost?

Type 64: If only I hadn't dropped out so early...

M99: It's not your fault, 64.

M99: Hawk's team was more hungry for victory this time round.

Type 64: Class Rep... I know I have great shortcomings.

Type 64: At this rate, I might lose something far more important than just cooking privileges.

M99: You-you're actually thinking that far ahead?

M99: Well, you were always the melancholic type, 64...

M99: Still, that's fine. You still have time to train yourself...

M99: Don't lose to Hawk and the others next time!

Type 64: Yeah...my thoughts exactly.

Type 64: Thank you, Class Rep.

...

Type 64: This feeling...is it frustration?

Type 64: I...I need to work harder!
Part 2

Type 64: Whew... Done at last.

Type 64: Let's look at today's data.

Type 64: Eh? I'm still no better than before.

Type 64: I've been training for almost two weeks, so why isn't it showing any results...?

???: Oh, it's you, 64. What are you doing here?

???: I rarely see you around this place.

Type 64: Ah, it's Miss Type 56R...

Type 64: I'm training myself here. I feel that my stamina's bad, so I want to condition myself...

Type56R: Is this about the lapcheung incident from earlier?

Type56R: (Sighs) Our younger comrades nowadays just don't understand how to treat their sisters-in-arms well.

Type56R: I can't believe Hawk got all serious over a simple meal. Don't you think she might've schemed against you during the obstacle course?

Type 64: It's not like that, Miss Type 56R...

Type 64: I dropped out halfway because I didn't have enough stamina.

Type56R: Well, no matter. Let them enjoy the taste of triumph this time round.

Type56R: No need to feel down. We'll do things right next time and win the kitchen back!

Type 64: That's why I need to train myself up.

Type 64: However, I haven't made any improvement in nearly two weeks of training, so I don't know what to do.

Type56R: If hard work isn't working out, then it's probably a problem with your methods.

Type56R: Want to ask Miss Kalina about it? She ought to be able to figure out where the problem lies.

Type 64: Mm-hm, I'll do that.

Type 64: Thank you for the suggestion, Miss Type 56R.

Type 64: (I'm sure Type 56R didn't want to lose to 56-1 either...)

Type 64: (So I've got even more reason not to disappoint her.)

Kalina: I see... So you wanted to improve your athletic ability, Miss 64.

Type 64: Yes, is there a way to do this?

Kalina: This...might come as a bit of a disappointment, but...

Kalina: Miss 64, your body's basic mobility falls short compared to the other Dolls.

Kalina: So even if I helped remodel you, spec-wise you'd only reach the level of an ordinary Doll at best.

Type 64: ...I see.

Kalina: Well...don't be sad, Miss 64.

Kalina: Being able to reach the average level is already pretty good.

Type 64: Um...

Type 64: Then can I trouble you to prepare a remodel kit for me?

Type 64: I want to become stronger...even if it's only a small improvement.

Kalina: Yup! I'll keep that in mind when making my orders!

Kalina: Tell you what, I'll contact you when the stock arrives!

Type 64: And so, that's how it went.

Type 64: Miss Kalina said a remodel wouldn't solve everything...

Type56R: Don't feel bad, 64. At least we know which path not to take now. That's a good thing, right?

Type56R: There are many ways to win a battle, and we may not necessarily have to compete with others in physical ability.

Type 64: ...So stamina isn't everything?

Type56R: You need to fight smart.

Type56R: Think about it. Leaving stamina aside, how are you better than Hawk and the others?

Type 64: ...

Type 64: It doesn't seem like I'm better than them in any way.

Type56R: Then...how about areas where you're different from them? That could work too.

Type 64: If I had to give an answer...

Type 64: Then I'd have to say that sometimes, they have a hard time spotting me because I'm very quiet.

Type56R: That's it!

Type56R: Being inconspicuous is also an advantage. That way you can circle behind the enemy more easily and sneak up on them during an attack, right?

Type 64: I've got it!

Type 64: I think I've got an idea about what kind of training I'm going to do... Thank you, Miss Type 56R.

Type 64: I need to go talk to Miss Kalina and revise the list of add-on parts I gave her just now.

Type56R: Mhm! I'm always happy to see my friends grow stronger!

Type56R: Do your best, Comrade 64!

Type 64: I will!

Type 64: I need to pull myself together so I don't waste the help that everyone gave me...
Part 3

M99: Our mission this time round is to establish a supply route.

M99: We might encounter a lot of S.F. forces along the way, so it's a pretty difficult mission.

M99: The Commander's already allocated the members of the main force, but we need a lookout... Any volunteers?

Griffin Doll: So I'll only be standing sentry...not interested.

Griffin Doll: Don't you need to run a long way to build a supply line?

Griffin Doll: Why not just randomly assign someone, Class Rep?

M99: Well, the people taking part in this operation will receive the privilege of preparing certain dishes.

M99: Thanks to a certain disturbance which arose last time, I'm coming before you now to get your opinions.

Griffin Doll: What, making dishes? I'll go!

Griffin Doll: Let me do it let me do it!

Griffin Doll: Get lost, you only know how to slurp sugar, send me instead!

Griffin Doll: What? You think you of the salt faction are magnificent? See if you can step out of HQ alive if you're so great!

M99: Wait...hold it, you lot!

M99: D-don't crowd around all of a sudden! I can't see anything!

M99: At attention, all of you! Stand in place!

Type 97S: Class Rep! Pick me, pick me!

Type 64: Class Rep, please let me go.

M99: Eh? You're applying to go too, 64?

M99: Building a supply line is pretty tough, you know.

Type 64: I understand, Class Rep. I am prepared for it...

Type 64: This mission, I must insist that it be assigned to me.

Type 97S: Huhhhh? As if a fragile princess like you could handle an op like that.

Type 97S: Class Rep, you'll rest more easily if you send me.

Type 64: I am not a fragile princess. At least, not anymore.

Type 97S: Are you challenging me?

M99: Hold it, you two... You're friends, you shouldn't be at each other's throats...

M99: If you can't settle it with an argument, then we'll settle it the usual way...

Type 97S: Bring it on, then! You think I'm scared?

Type 64: I won't lose... Not this time!

...

An hour later, the exercise is in its final stages...

Type 97S: It's so quiet... Everyone else was eliminated already...

Type 97S: 64's the only one left. I didn't think she'd actually survive until the end.

Type 97S: Still, it doesn't matter. There's still a chance to turn the tables.

Type 97S: I just saw her hide behind that piece of cover on the other side. All I need to do is go over and finish her off. This time...

Type 64: I win, Miss Hawk.

Type 97S: 64?! When did you...

Type 64 pulls the trigger.

M99: Alright, the exercise is over.

M99: According to the results, Type 64 has earned the right to take part in this operation.

Type 97S: How did...

Type 97S: I didn't hear a thing and...

Type 64: I've always been very quiet, Hawk... Have you forgotten?

Type 64: After losing to you the last time round, I decided to focus on training up that aspect of myself.

M99: "A scholar's absence of three days thereafter must be viewed under new light". You'll need to work hard too, Hawk.

Type 97S: Ah, I lost to you this time, 64.

Type 97S: But it won't be so easy next time!

Type 64: Mm, I know that. Therefore, I'll keep pushing myself.

Type 64: Actually, it's thanks to everyone that I managed to improve.

Type 64: So I'd like to to make everyone a cup of tea before the mission begins.

Type 64: I can still recall the taste that cup of tea left on the tip of my tongue for a long time afterwards.

Type 64: It was the most delicious tea I'd ever had. It tasted...like victory.
Part 4

Type 56-1: Hawk, I just saw 64 bringing some meat to the kitchen...

Type 56-1: Is she going to make salty lapcheungs again?

Type 97S: My body's in peril...

Type 97S: Although, Class Rep said earlier that 64 and the others had the privilege of deciding how to handle the new batch of supplies.

Type 56-1: Then we need to find some way to stop them!

Type 56-1: Also, what's got to you today? Weren't you the one who vehemently swore to prevent 64 from making salty lapcheungs last time?

Type 97S: This isn't...

Type 97S: A bunch of things happened.

Type 56-1: Well, we need to stop her from making those dreadful lapcheungs! You can't eat meat when it's like that!

Type 56-1: We'll use the usual trick!

Type 97S: Haha... I hope it works.

Type 56-1: 64, can we have Coca-Cola chicken wings for dinner tonight?

Type 56-1: We've already bought the soda.

Type 64: Alright, since everyone wants it...

Type 64: We haven't finished the chicken wings from last time yet, so there's no harm adding an extra dish.

Type 64: ...What's the matter?

Type 56-1: Nothing... It just feels like your outfit is way cooler than your previous one. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Type 64: Don't worry. I'm still me. My tastes and temperament haven't changed.

Type 56-1: Aiya...we'll just have to make do with your tastes, then.

Type 56-1: It's not like we're admitting defeat so easily, but let's work together for this meal. I'll help take care of the wings.

Type 64: Yes, please do.

Type 56-1: 64, the wings are almost at the right temperature.

Type 64: Leave the rest to me.

64 picks up the soda cans beside her, then opens and pours them into the big wok one after the other with practiced movements.

Type 56-1: 64...

Type 56-1: Are your hands alright?

Type 64: Of course they are. See? They're fine.

Type 56-1: Didn't you always cut your hands in the past after opening a few ring pull cans?

Type 64: That was in the past...

Type 64: After some training, I can handle most difficult missions now.

Type 64: Opening a few cans is child's play in comparison.

Type 56-1: Congrats, 64...

Type 56-1: I'm just not used to you becoming so amazing all of a sudden.

Type 64: Haha, well, you'll get used to it.

Type 64: It'll happen someday, just like how you'll get used to eating the food I make...

Type 64: You'll all learn to live with the brand new me.

Type 64: So don't fall behind, everyone. Do your best.

Type 64: Whether in cooking or combat, we won't lose to anyone so long as we work hard!
