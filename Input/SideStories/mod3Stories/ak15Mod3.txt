What are Tactical Dolls?

Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) are essentially a kind of Autonomous Dolls (A-Dolls), whose development began in 2033. These androids physically resemble human beings and are equipped with extremely advanced artificial intelligence.

A-Dolls given high combat capability through Imprint technology and Dummy Network are known as T-Dolls.

Persica: ...These so-called Tactical Dolls, ahem, are much more than mere weapons.

Persica: In fact, from my research, I've learned that the neural cloud of T-Dolls have infinite potential.

Persica: Its processing capacity exceeds any scientist or computer.

Persica: To lift all restrictions and let them grow freely—this is my primary concept for the third-gen T-Doll.

Shaw: ...Preposterous.

Shaw: T-Dolls are defined by their value as weapons.

Shaw: Horsepower, resilience, versatility, specialized assault capability... Performance is paramount.

Shaw: Developing neural clouds in such an aimless and haphazard manner will not reap any tangible reward; you're just trying to indulge your own poetic sensibilities.

Shaw: What are you planning to create? Divinities? ...Who do you think you are, Persica?

Persica: A base layer that is completely pure and empty—a clean slate with no restrictions. What would a Doll with such a base layer grow into?

Persica: This isn't playing God; it's simply exploring my curiosity about my own creations as a scientist.

Shaw: Your curiosity will bring nothing but danger.

Shaw: Even if... you must, this shouldn't be the way.

Shaw: Even you yourself don't enjoy real freedom. To fantasize about granting freedom to robots is not only ridiculous, it is downright laughable.

Persica: As my Dolls resemble humans more and more, they stop being mere weapons or robots.

Persica: They are something more precious, something neither you, I, nor anyone else can constrain.

Persica: Before you are a weapon specialist, you are first and foremost a scientist. And as a scientist, Shaw, you cannot reject the future.

Shaw: Future? Let me tell you what the future is.

Shaw: Your idea is fundamentally flawed, Persica.

Shaw: The way to make Dolls more human isn't to give them freedom, but to give them the right to "defiance".

Shaw: Absolute freedom is not human at all. Only in constraints can real freedom emerge.

Shaw: Your delusion might become reality, but such a future would not be decided by humans.

Shaw: Because humans who are not free can never create free souls.

Shaw: I am I when I am I.

Shaw: Only in defiance will one find the Truth.

...

......

A pair of crimson eyes flash sharply in the dark.

A torrent of incoming data are being sorted and categorized rapidly.

She is no longer in the old mansion. This is another new beginning.

AK-15: ...

She is a wolf. A wolf's eyes are made for hunting.

AN-94: How do you feel, AK-15?

AK-15: ...Very good.

Her eyes shift onto her colleague and quickly take in her new body.

...Evidently, she has received an upgrade.

AN-94: How are your... eyes?

AK-15: ...

The mechanical eyes scan the entire room steadily.

Everything appears as usual to her vision, where everything is tinged with red.

RPK-16: I'm curious—what is the world like in your eyes, 15?

RPK-16: ...Tell me all about it, I'll listen to you all day.

AK-15: Same as usual.

She replies softly.

...

Bureau of State Security, Moscow, Neo-Soviet Union.

AK-15: ...

She slowly opens her eyes. The darkness gradually fades away as countless data and information rush into her neural cloud once more.

AK-15: ...Doctor Shaw.

A person appears in her field of vision. AK-15 offers no reaction other than a calm and simple greeting.

Shaw: Morning, AK-15.

Shaw: You don't have to worry about your missions today. I have things to discuss with you.

AK-15: About my "partner"?

Shaw: Yep.

AK-15 falls silent. She closes her eyes.

In the darkness, she finds her calm again.

AK-15: I don't understand, Doctor Shaw.

AK-15: Do I really need a partner?

Shaw: ...

Shaw, who has been walking ahead, pauses mid-stride. She turns around and looks at AK-15 while tapping her fingers against her tablet.

Shaw: What do you mean by that?

AK-15: I am fully capable of completing my missions on my own.

Shaw: ...You are indeed very powerful, AK-15. You're my best work.

Shaw: However, that doesn't give you the right to question me, do you understand?

AK-15: My apologies, it was not my intention to question your decision.

There is a moment of silence, which AK-15 surprisingly breaks again.

AK-15: Is AK-12... also equipped with Wolf Eye?

Shaw: Whyever not?

Shaw: The Wolf Eye System is one of my most successful inventions.

Shaw must be in a pretty good mood to humor AK-15 and answer all her questions.

AK-15: ...

...So there's another Doll who sees the world the same way as she does?

Shaw: However, hers is slightly different from yours.

AK-15: ...Different?

Knock knock.

Shaw: AK-12, come and meet your part—

AK-15: ...

Apart from the two individuals who have just entered the room, not another soul can be found in the silent lab.

Shaw: ...Where is she? Nadia?

"Nadia": The surveillance cameras inside the lab have been hacked. Reconnecting...

"Nadia": AK-12 is currently—

???: Oh? Looking for me?

AK-15: !!

Ploop.

With a nonchalant question, the slender T-Doll emerges from behind without warning. Her hand brushes past AK-15 lightly.

Two grenades with pulled pins are now hanging on AK-15's waist.

Before Shaw can even tell what just happened, AK-15's mighty kick has sent the Doll flying.

???: Oof!

The Doll crashes heavily into the entrance of the lab. The metal sliding door buckles from the impact before rupturing completely.

AK-15: Get down!

Shaw: Wha—?!

The unexpected development leaves Shaw completely stunned. AK-15 dives at her and pins her to the ground before she can react.

AK-15 then quickly throws the two grenades through the gap between the broken door and shields Shaw with her own body.

AK-15: ...

However, even after a long silence, the anticipated explosion never comes.

"Nadia": ...No explosives detected.

"Nadia": AK-15, those were replicas.

???: Ow ow ow... Sheesh, I didn't expect you'd just kick me right in the gut.

AK-15: ...What?

Shaw: Get. OFF. me.

Shaw shrugs off AK-15's "protection" and scrambles to her feet a bit clumsily.

There is a smile on her face, but she certainly doesn't look the slightest bit amused.

A vein is visibly throbbing on her forehead as she walks up to the Doll still groaning in pain. She bends down and grabs the Doll roughly by the face.

Shaw: Do you want me to throw you into the furnace, AK-12?

She asks with a threatening smile. Even AK-15 backs away instinctively.

AK-12: Oh, ahahaha, did I make you mad, Shaw? ...Sorry.

With puckered lips, AK-12 puts up her arms and surrenders.

Shaw: Tsk... Don't do that again.

Shaw: Unlike you two, I can't take much rough-housing.

The moment AK-12 apologizes, the menacing air vanishes from Shaw. She lets go of AK-12 and dusts herself off.

AK-12: Haha... Sorry about that.

AK-12: But this is my first meeting with my partner.

AK-12: Don't you think it'd be kinda underwhelming to just say "hello"?

AK-12: But thanks to this, I now know for sure that you're strong as heck, AK-15.

AK-12: You almost broke my spine.

AK-15: ...

AK-15: ...What's wrong with your eyes?

AK-12: Hm?

AK-15 stares at AK-12's closed eyes and utters in uncharacteristic surprise.

AK-15: Why are they closed?

AK-12: What a good question. Nadia, why are you called Nadia?

"Nadia": It is a diminutive of "Nadezhda".

AK-15: I'm serious, AK-12.

AK-15: Why are you keeping your eyes closed?

AK-12: I'm keeping them closed because there's no reason to open them at the moment.

AK-12: Why does it matter?

Shaw: Leave this nonsense till later. You interrupted all my plans. Now get up.

AK-12: Okay~

AK-15: ...

Shaw: ...Listen up, I'm only going to say this once.

Shaw: Starting from today, you two will be partners going on joint missions.

Shaw: AK-15, you are to obey AK-12's commands. While Anna is absent, AK-12 is the leader of the team, you understand?

AK-15: ...Based on her behavior, I am skeptical of her ability to take charge.

Shaw: ...We'll get back to that little stunt she pulled later.

Shaw: Right now, I have a mission for you two... I know you've barely met, but you need to set out straight away.

AK-12: Isn't this the perfect chance to test my performance and our chemistry?

Shaw: I'll send you the mission brief in a minute.

Shaw: Any questions, AK-15?

AK-15: ...No.

AK-12: Well, pleased to meet you, AK-15.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 eyes AK-12 wordlessly with a frown.

...

Mission File 11240601.

0523, XX/XX/206X.

Kemerovo, Western Magadan Oblast.

"Incident Zero".

Onboard the aircraft.

AK-12: ...

AK-15: ...

AK-15 is sitting quietly in her seat and fixing AK-12 with a slightly frigid stare.

AK-12's eyes are still tightly closed. AK-15 can't tell if she's sleeping, or if she is also studying herself.

AK-12: Do my eyes bother you that much?

...Judging by her question, it's clearly the latter.

AK-15: No.

AK-12: Were you also like this back when you were working with human soldiers?

AK-15: What do you mean?

AK-12: Were you also this cold? Sorry, I've never been on a mission before, I'm not quite sure how to pass the time.

AK-15: This would usually be the time when they explain the mission.

AK-12: I see. Haha, don't take this personally. It's not that I don't want to explain, it simply isn't time yet.

The sight of AK-12's frivolous grin only makes AK-15 even more irritable.

AK-12: Shaw only gave me a mission overview. I've notified the Statesec agents at our destination.

AK-12: They will brief us on the current situation in detail, then I'll put together a specific operation plan.

AK-12: Patience, 15. We WILL complete the mission.

AK-12: But before that, why don't you learn how to smile?

As if to stoke AK-15's temper deliberately, AK-12's grin widens.

AK-15: ...I don't see the point.

AK-15: Smiling isn't conducive to our mission.

AK-12: Au contraire, 15. Why do you think we're designed to look like humans?

AK-12: It WILL negatively affect our mission if we can't work well with humans.

AK-12: Some things can't be done with just T-Dolls.

AK-15: ...I doubt that.

AK-15: I have always worked solo because no one else could keep up with my pace.

AK-15: The results spoke for themselves. It was the most effective way of handling missions.

AK-12: Do you actually believe you completed those missions all by yourself, AK-15?

AK-12: You think everyone else is utterly useless?

AK-12: If you genuinely believe that, you're one presumptuous prick.

AK-15: I followed my instructions and completed my missions. Interaction with humans was unnecessary.

AK-12: You are just a single chess piece in a game. Without any strategic foundation, you can't do anything.

AK-15: My specs and performance outmatch most tactics and strategies. I can complete my mission even without a detailed plan.

AK-12: That's exactly something a gorilla would say... How strange. Why are you like this?

AK-15: I could ask you the same question.

AK-15: Your eyes can give you all the information you need, so why aren't you using them?

AK-12: The world looks extremely dull when cast in a crimson light. The way Shaw and other humans see it is so much more interesting.

AK-12: I can see it that way too with my eyes closed.

AK-12: What's wrong with enjoying a change of scenery when out on a rare outing?

AK-15: ...

AK-15 clenches her fists as she glares at AK-12's eyes in silence.

Even though AK-12 didn't give a straight answer when she was first questioned about her eyes, AK-15 already had an inkling about her strange habit. But now that she actually admits to the real reason, AK-15 is still baffled.

AK-15: ...I don't understand. As a weapon on legs, what justifications do you have for letting down your guard?

AK-15: Why aren't you always prepared for a fight?

AK-12: Who knows? Perhaps I'd rather spend my energy on more intellectual pursuits?

AK-12: I don't see a problem with this. I rather enjoy the process of taking in the world slowly.

AK-12's flippant and offhanded reply shows that she clearly doesn't care.

AK-15: ...Why is my successor defective?

These cutting words come out of AK-15's mouth in a sudden burst of frustration.

AK-12: I don't know either. Why don't you go ask Shaw herself?

AK-15: ...

AK-12: I'm afraid that's all the idle chitchat we can do; we're almost there.

AK-12: Just so you know, our future commander, a certain Miss Angelia will be observing our mission remotely.

AK-12: If we don't do our job properly, our future boss will look down on us.

AK-15: ...Understood.

AK-15 closes her eyes.

In the tranquil darkness, the howling wind and cantankerous propellers bring her solace.

She must complete her mission—it is her duty as the most powerful weapon, one that she takes seriously.

She won't let anyone slow her down.

...Not even her so-called "partner".
Part 2

2

...

AN-94: ...I thought your body was plenty strong.

AN-94: I never thought it could become even stronger.

AN-94 watches silently as AK-15's body undergoes further testing and adjustment. She tilts her head to read the parameter table and can't help but marvel out loud.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 also turns to study the the displayed parameters.

AK-15: Doctor Shaw's design was flawless, but she kept another design with even higher efficacy when I was rolled out.

AK-15: That design couldn't be realized back then due to material limitations, but that's no longer a problem.

AN-94: Compared to your old body, the density in your synthetic muscles is now higher.

AN-94: And yet your total weight has been reduced... You now pack an even harder punch.

This is without a doubt a body forged for battle—a warrior's body in its purest form.

AN-94 chuckles in amusement as she recalls how she once recklessly issued a challenge to the owner of this body.

AK-15: ...Just having overwhelming force is not enough.

RPK-16: What you lack is just the bigger picture. You're perfectly capable of making sound judgment, 15.

AK-15: ...

She stares at the wall and slowly closes her eyes.

...

...This isn't the first time AK-15 has been on a mission. In fact, she is currently the only T-Doll with experience in actual combat in the Wolf Pack.

In her previous missions, she only had a simple routine to follow—receive the mission brief, get on the truck, and kill whomever needs killing.

She wouldn't exchange more than three words with anyone throughout the entire process.

AK-15: ...

Which explains why she simply doesn't understand why she's been standing like a statue in a corner of the temporary command post, with absolutely nothing to do.

AK-12: I need more details to formulate a comprehensive battle plan.

AK-12: So please don't waste our precious time, alright?

Intel Officer: ...Right.

The intelligence officer in charge of the scene nods and turns to face the map pinned on the wall.

Intel Officer: At the moment, we've gained control over 70% of the affected area, but the syndicate members have hunkered down inside the central structure. They're using the terrain to their advantage and drawing us into a stalemate.

Intel Officer: We've tried to negotiate, but we cannot meet their demands.

AK-12: Why can't we just blow up the building?

Intel Officer: They have hostages.

AK-12: I see... So that's the big idea, eh?

With her arms crossed in front of her chest and a grin on her face, AK-12 studies the map with great interest.

Intel Officer: The hostages comprise some civilians who couldn't evacuate in time... as well as an important figure.

AK-12: Important figure?

Intel Officer: He's the son of a certain political leader.

Intel Officer: Due to his father's influence, we'd like to resolve the situation without any harm coming to him.

AK-12: What's a VIP doing in this kind of place?

Intel Officer: ...It's part of his father's political campaign.

AK-12: Ha~ Humans.

AK-12 lets out a derisive chuckle. She sits down on a chair and starts drumming her fingers on the table.

Intel Officer: We've heard a great deal about the White Mastiff's valor in battle. We're also bringing you in this time, Snow Wolf. With the two of you, nothing can go amiss on this mission.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 looks up as she hears her codename being mentioned.

AK-12: I have a plan.

However, AK-12 pays no mind to the praise being heaped onto them. She snaps her fingers and draws everyone's attention back to herself.

AK-12: To ensure the hostages' safety, we'll need to subdue their captors at close range.

AK-12: But this building is too exposed; it's virtually impossible to slip inside undetected.

AK-12: So I'm proposing a feint. Your forces are to launch a feint attack and distract them.

AK-12: I'll conceal myself in your midst and infiltrate the building when I get the chance.

Intel Officer: A feint, you say...? That's rather risky when they have hostages at their mercy.

AK-12: But this is the only way to get them out of there.

AK-12: Don't worry, since that kid is so important, I wouldn't kill him so easily if I were them.

AK-12: I'm guessing they'll probably start with the civilians.

AK-12: These are the steps they'll take—make threats, kill the civilians one by one, and negotiate. They'll only resort to bringing out the key hostage when they're truly desperate.

Intel Officer: You're planning to rescue him at the cost of the civilians' lives? ...I suppose that IS very efficient.

AK-12: Of course not. I intend to resolve the matter while they're still on the first step.

AK-12: Causing unnecessary bloodshed is an affront to my sense of aesthetics.

AK-15: ...Then how should we proceed?

AK-12: I need three... no, four small forces to attack the building from four different directions.

AK-12: Since this is to be a feint, they won't have to actually storm the building. In fact, they should take care not to alarm the captors too much.

AK-12: I'll be working together with Team A. Once I give the signal, they'll blow up the front door with a grenade, and I'll sneak inside.

Intel Officer: By our estimate, you'll have 15 minutes max.

AK-12: That'll be enough.

AK-15: Wait.

AK-15 interrupts with a frown. Even she can tell something is amiss with AK-12's plan.

AK-15: You'll sneak inside, then what about me?

AK-15: I'm too strong to feint an attack.

AK-12: You're right, which is why you'll be staying here, 15. We won't be needing you this time.

AK-15: ...What?

AK-12: In other words, you don't need to participate in this mission, 15.

AK-12: Just sit tight and wait for my good news.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 stares at AK-12 in shock. Only then does the truth dawn on her.

AK-15: I'm not part of your plan?

AK-12: You're not, because there's no place for you in it.

AK-12: If I put you into the decoy teams, the feint would turn into a genuine assault.

AK-12: It isn't practical to have you infiltrate the building either. First of all, you stick out. Besides, the way you fight causes too much of a ruckus.

AK-15: I object to this plan.

AK-12: Objection denied. Don't forget, 15, I'm the one in command here.

AK-15: ...

AK-12: Trust me, 15.

AK-12: It won't even take 15 minutes. I'll get them out in only ten.

AK-15 looks at AK-12 with clenched fists. The silence hangs heavily in the air, but she can't say anything to rebuke AK-12.

Not that she isn't able to, but rather she isn't allowed to.

Shaw paired them up and put AK-12 in charge.

AK-15 is a weapon, and a weapon must obey the one who wields it.

AK-15: You are in command.

AK-15: I obey.

AK-12: Good. I thought you'd give me a hard time.

AK-12: In that case, that's the plan. Let's get moving, people.

Seeing that there isn't any other objection, AK-12 waves her hand.

Intel Officer: ...Understood. I shall organize the forces to launch a feint attack immediately.

Once AK-12 has given the word, the command post starts bustling with activity right away. Everyone quickly heads to their respective posts and does their part to facilitate AK-12's plan.

Meanwhile, AK-15 stays where she is, still leaning against the wall, just watching everyone else get to work with clenched fists.

...

AK-15: ...

Ten minutes have passed.

Statesec's feint forces have retreated smoothly after the initial attack, and AK-12 has entered the building according to plan.

Intel Officer: Not surprisingly... the feint triggered those terrorists.

Intel Officer: They're getting ready to start executing the civilians.

AK-15 studies the control monitor closely. It has already been five minutes since AK-12 went dark.

None of them knows how things are going on her end, but the sharp blade hanging above the hostage's head is very visible.

AK-15: ...

At this rate, there's no guarantee that the hostages will survive.

These terrorists aren't fools; they'll soon realize the truth behind the feint.

AK-12's specs don't give her an overwhelming advantage. If she's exposed, she'll have a very difficult time just making it out alive, let alone keep the hostages safe.

Intel Officer: Still no news from AK-12?

Even the PIC, who initially had a great deal of faith in AK-12, is now feeling anxious.

However, AK-12 still hasn't got in touch, and the negotiators have been unsuccessful in pacifying the terrorists. The execution of hostages appears to be imminent.

AK-15: Launch another feint.

Staring at the eerily silent building on the monitor, AK-15 proposes a course of action quietly.

Intel Officer: ...What did you say?

The intelligence officer looks at her in surprise.

AK-15: I suggest another feint.

Intel Officer: ...But AK-12 said to give her 15 minutes.

AK-15: The hostages don't have 15 minutes.

Intel Officer: ...

AK-15: Launch another feint so that I can get in from the roof.

AK-15: I can subdue them.

Intel Officer: How much time do you need? ...Three minutes?

AK-15: Just one.

Intel Officer: ...But your leader told you to stand by.

AK-15: You're the person-in-charge; your authority is higher than AK-12's.

On one hand is AK-12, whom they still haven't heard from, on the other are the hostages, whose very lives are on the line.

After a brief moment of hesitation, the PIC looks up.

Intel Officer: This is outrageous... Aren't you supposed to be partners?

AK-15: ...

Intel Officer: Still, you're the only ones I can count on now.

AK-15 blinks in silent acknowledgment. After a pause, she turns and picks up her weapon from the table.

Intel Officer: You have one minute. If you can really subdue them, we'll deal with the hostages.

AK-15: ...

AK-15: ...Leave it to me.

AK-15: ...AK-12.

AK-15: No matter what you're thinking...

AK-15: I can't submit to your command, nor can I bring myself to trust you.

...

AK-15: ...

Another two minutes have passed, and still no sign of AK-12's voice in AK-15's earpiece.

Intel Officer: You don't have much time, AK-15.

Intel Officer: This is our last gamble... To be honest, civilian casualties aren't that big of a deal as long as they're within permissible limit.

Intel Officer: However, you must help us rescue the VIP.

AK-15: ...Understood.

Things are now developing in a way that AK-15 is comfortable with.

She takes off her earpiece and leans out of the helicopter. The rooftop of the building is right beneath her.

(Mechanical whir)

Her Wolf Eye contracts slightly as she zeroes in on the armed guard on the rooftop.

If the helicopter descends any further, it will run the risk of being shot down.

AK-15: ...

Fortunately, that isn't necessary.

Boom!!!!

Terrorist: What?! What just happened?!

Thug: Statesec is coming in! Some monster just landed from above!

Thug: All the men upstairs have been killed! She... she seems to know our location! She's coming straight for us!

Terrorist: Dammit! These assholes... Kill the kid!

AK-12: I'm afraid I can't allow that.

AK-12: Tsk, I was this close. Why is she such a meddler?

Terrorist: A... a Doll?!

Terrorist: Stop her!

Thug: Argh!!

Bam!!!!

The moment AK-15 comes crashing through the wall, her attention is immediately seized by AK-12.

AK-15: ...AK-12?

AK-12: Capture him! Alive!

AK-15 is a bit taken aback by AK-12's appearance, but she shows no hesitation whatsoever.

A bullet flies out from AK-15's gun and penetrates the terrorist's skull in an instant.

It pierces through his central cortex.

The shot kills the man instantly, giving him no chance to act.

However...

AK-12: Didn't I tell you to capture him alive?!!

AK-12: For Christ's sake!!!

AK-15: !!

Without a second thought, AK-12 throws herself over the hostages.

AK-15 looks down—something is combusting right beneath her feet.

...It's an explosive device activated by the terrorist's cardiac arrest.

BOOM!!!!!

...
Part 3

...

AN-94: Your weapon has also been calibrated.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 slowly gets down from the testing platform. She raises her hand and stares at her palm. Then she curls her fingers into a fist and throws a few jabs.

AK-15: AK-15...

She picks up her gun from the table.

The scratches aren't too obvious, but they're definitely still there on the surface of the metal.

AN-94: If you wish to Imprint with a heavier weapon, we can try to put in a request.

AK-15: ...

RPK-16: We're partners, 15. You can share your thoughts with us.

AK-15: No need.

AK-15 inserts a magazine into the AK-15 assault rifle and racks the bolt with practiced ease, producing a nice and crisp sound.

AK-15: This is my partner.

...

Repair Workshop, Statesec.

The two T-Dolls caught in the explosion have been given a clean bill of health, but the moment they're discharged from the repair workshop, they get into a fierce argument.

AK-12: Why did you disobey me, AK-15?

AK-12: Do you have any idea how bad the consequences were because of your unauthorized action?

AK-12: Not only was our target severely injured from burns and smoke inhalation, even the other hostages were caught in the explosion.

AK-15: I don't understand your plan. It was inefficient, and it greatly increased the likelihood of failure.

AK-15: You made an error of judgment as the commander, AK-12

AK-12: ...O ye of little faith, AK-15.

AK-12: I didn't expect you to comprehend my plan.

AK-12: But I think I can now safely assume that you never intended to submit to my authority to begin with.

AK-15: ...

AK-12's eyes are now wide open, and AK-15 meets her gaze.

As the wolves try to stare each other down, AK-15 finally starts feeling a faint sense of connection with AK-12.

AK-15: Obeying your command and submitting to your authority would lower my efficiency in carrying out my mission.

AK-15: AK-12, you are a hindrance to me.

AK-12: ...

In the face of AK-15's insult, AK-12 remains impassive. After a pause, she takes two steps closer to AK-15.

AK-15: ...What are you doing?

AK-12: You're very confident in your own performance, yeah?

AK-12: Perhaps you think AN-94 and I... No, you believe that nobody can keep up with you.

AK-12: Is that why you don't need a partner? Why you'll disobey an order when it doesn't suit you?

AK-15: I obey my orders.

AK-15: I always choose the most effective method to complete a mission.

AK-12: Hahahahaha... Don't make me laugh, AK-15. You know what? Maybe you should get a job at the zoo. It'll suit you better.

AK-12 suddenly closes her eyes and laughs mockingly. She then purses her lips and pauses for a while.

AK-12: In that case, let's have a duel, AK-15.

AK-15: ...What?

AK-15's eyes widen in disbelief.

AK-12: You're awfully confident in yourself, but let me tell you, you give yourself too much credit.

AK-12: You're not as good as you think. I can beat you, simple as that.

AK-12: You heard that right—just the two of us, one-to-one, no guns.

AK-15: Is something wrong with your neural cloud, AK-12?

AK-15: Or are you just trying to piss me off?

AK-15: If that's what you want, it's not working.

AK-12: You scared?

AK-15: ...

On the training ground.

AK-15: ...It isn't too late to back out, AK-12.

AK-12: You're always so hard on AN-94, is it because you also think of her as a hindrance?

AK-15: ...

AK-12: She thinks you hate her.

AK-12: If you actually acknowledge her as a decent fighter, why don't you show some encouragement?

AK-15: ...I don't do pointless things.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 chuckles at AK-15's reply. Then she positions herself in the corner of the room.

AK-12: Need some warm-up?

AK-15: No—

Whoosh!

AK-15: —need.

Smack!

AK-12 and AK-15 are both top-tier units under the Wolf Pack Project. In order words, even if AK-12's specs aren't on par with AK-15's, she is no weakling at all.

Before AK-15 can even finish her sentence, AK-12 is already charging in like a silver thunderbolt, her knifehand strike slicing through the air and going straight for AK-15's face.

AK-15: (Grunts)

This surprise attack is no more than an ineffective probe to AK-15.

She can also tell from this one simple strike what AK-12's intentions are.

AK-15: ...

I see.

She's after my eyes.

After putting some distance between them, AK-15 brings her fists up to guard her face. Her gaze grows even colder as she watches AK-12.

She has now entered combat mode, and AK-12 is an "enemy".

AK-12: Such intricate parts are wasted on you when all you rely on is brute force.

Even though her first strike has failed and betrayed her strategy, AK-12 looks completely unfazed.

She holds up her hands in readiness, not bothering to hide her intention of exploiting any weakness in AK-15.

AK-15: ...

Now that AK-15 knows what to defend against, AK-12 won't be able to break through her defenses with her strength and speed.

She has already lost this duel.

AK-12: (Inhales)

While AK-15 is focused on guarding her face, AK-12 switches to attacking her torso and lower abdomen.

AK-15's right arm shot out like a whip and makes to grab hold of AK-12.

AK-15: —!

Knowing that the duel will be over the moment she gets caught, AK-12 bends down at an extreme angle to evade AK-15's grasp.

Then without pause, she delivers an uppercut from her contorted position, bypassing AK-15's other defending arm and going for her eyes again.

Bam!

AK-12's attack is foiled yet again. Taking advantage of her stature, AK-15 tries to close the distance and takes hold of her body.

AK-12: Don't even think about it!

AK-12 immediately rights herself and backs away before AK-15 can reach her.

AK-15: ...

Not giving AK-12 any time to recover, AK-15 presses on with another attack.

The T-Dolls have already exchanged several blows over the course of just a few breaths.

Having become familiarized with AK-12's moves, AK-15 grows more aggressive and lands several punches on AK-12's face.

AK-12: ...Tsk.

AK-12 tuts in displeasure and wipes away the bionic blood dripping out of her nose.

AK-15: ...

...Is this how AK-12 is going to beat her?

How naïve. Why? Why is her successor so inept?

Their arms collide in mid-air, producing clangs louder and sharper than any metallic blades.

AK-12 has no ace in the hole. Her body is very sophisticated, but only about as sophisticated as the prototype unit, AN-94.

AK-12 has no chance of defeating herself... so why?

AK-15: ...What on earth are you thinking, AK12?

AK-15 gradually dominates the rhythm of their bout, but even as the scales tip more and more clearly in AK-15's favor, AK-12 doesn't seem the least bit concerned.

She seems to be absolutely sure that victory will be hers.

Thud.

AK-12 has been backed into a wall. There's nowhere else to go.

AK-15: ...Yield, AK-12.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 doesn't reply and simply draws her combat knife.

...What good would that flimsy weapon do her?

AK-12: —

Whoosh!

AK-15: ...

Futile struggles.

Smack!

Combat knife gleaming dangerously in hand, AK-12 widens her stance and goes straight for AK-15's flank.

...Child's play. Her attacks are too predictable.

AK-15 grabs hold of AK-12's wrist.

Then her other hand wraps around her throat.

AK-15: Game over...

AK-15: ?!

...It is not over yet.

AK-12: Heheh.

AK-15 leans forward as she grapples with AK-12, but her forward momentum is doubled as her balance keeps tilting.

What—

AK-15: Crap.

She's been had.

The moment she gets hold of AK-12, her own center of gravity is used against her.

Thunk!

The two Dolls crash heavily onto the floor. Without giving AK-15 the time to react, AK-12 retakes the initiative.

...It was an act.

Everything she's been doing was an act! It was never her intention to go for the eyes.

From the very beginning... AK-12 has been biding her time before drawing this duel onto the ground when her guard is down.

Her hand is still wrapped tightly around AK-12's throat.

But AK-12 won't pass up this hard-earned opportunity.

AK-15: —!

AK-12: —!

The Dolls grapple in silence. This is a contest of pure strength.

...She's actually locked in a stalemate with AK-12.

AK-12: ...What about now, AK-15?

AK-12: Do you still think you can win for sure?

AK-15: You...!

Fury blazes in AK-15's eyes, but it doesn't change the predicament she's currently in.

AK-12 wraps her legs around the left arm that AK-15 is using to choke her. At the same time, she pins down AK-15's right arm with her right foot.

With AK-15 immobilized, AK-12 presses the sharp combat knife against her neck.

AK-15: Ugh... Gah!

The glinting edge is dangerously close to AK-15's neck, where her neural cloud is connected to the motor control hub of her body.

AK-12 has her completely cornered. Under these circumstances, she is without a doubt at an overwhelming disadvantage.

...This shouldn't be.

AK-12: ...You've never experienced this before, have you, AK-15?

AK-12: You think just because you're so strong, you're above learning this kind of technique that humans use to "overcome strength with weakness".

AK-15: Guh... Aaaargh...!!

Even in this impossible position, AK-15 still tries to push the knife away from her with the hand that's been grabbing AK-12's wrist.

(Crackle)

The wrist on AK-12's knife-wielding hand gives off a few sparks as the circuit threatens to short out. With her other arm now freed up, she braces her right hand against the left and leans her entire upper body into the knife.

AK-12 is well aware of the difference in their specs, but she is nevertheless amazed that AK-15 still has the strength to repel her thrust even under these circumstances.

AK-12: (Grunts)

Like AK-15, she cannot be certain that she'll win.

AK-15: —!!!

AK-12: What...?!

The pinning hold is threatening to come apart under AK-15's brute force. Even with both of AK-12's legs wrapped around it, her left arm can still muster the strength to throw AK-12 off.

She can still win.

Her superior specs make it possible to turn the tables even when she's at a disadvantage.

She can do it.

AK-12: You... don't know when to give up, do you...

AK-15: Ugh!!

(Crackle)

AK-12's vocal module is crushed in the deadlock, but even now, she is still grinning maniacally.

AK-15: Argh... Hargghhh...!!

The knife is slowly lifting off her neck. In this contest of strength, she still has the upper hand.

She can win... She will win...

Even if there's no momentum to ride; even if gravity is working against her; even if she has to overpower two arms with only one.

She can still win.

She is... the most powerful T-Doll in the entire Neo-Soviet Union—

AK-12: You... really... are strong...

AK-12's voice is grotesquely distorted as she speaks through her damaged vocal module, acknowledging AK-15's strength...

...While also pronouncing her defeat.

AK-12: But... it's... over.

AK-15: —!!!

AK-12 suddenly twists her whole body to the right with all her might.

Using her own hip as the fulcrum, she flips AK-15's body over and pins her arm firmly behind her back.

AK-15's strength... buckles.

AK-12: (Crackle)

As electronic body parts creak and crackle more and more dangerously, AK-12 braces her knees against AK-15's armpits. She scrunches up her torso and throws all her weight into the thrust.

(Squelch)

AK-15: ...

AK-15's eyes widen.

The cold knife is buried in the back of her neck. The moment the connection between the neural cloud and the body is severed, the Doll loses all motor control.

...She... she lost?

...

AK-12: (Croaks)

It takes AK-12 all her remaining strength to peel AK-15's fingers off her throat. She collapses on the floor with her arms spread out.

Her combat knife is sticking out of AK-15's spinal cord, rendering her paralyzed.

(Crackle)

AK-12's right wrist is dangling from her arm, connected only by a small bunch of wires. She now wholeheartedly agrees that her partner is an absolute force of nature.

Shaw: ...You're looking the worse for wear.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 turns her head to look at Shaw, who's casually leaning against the door. Her face remains impassive.

"Nadia": Unfortunately, I had to notify Doctor Shaw when things escalated.

AK-12: "If. You were watching."

AK-12: "Why. Didn't you. Stop. Us."

Shaw: ...Why are you talking like that? It's creeping me out.

AK-12 has connected to the radio station and by stringing together audio files of words and phrases she needs, she communicates with Shaw using this comical voice while keeping her face completely deadpan.

AK-12: "My. Vocal. Module. Is damaged."

Shaw: ...This is worse than I thought.

Shaw lights a cigarette and peers at AK-15, who is lying immobile on the floor.

...Still, a winner is a winner, even if the victory came at a great cost.

Shaw: ...Why didn't I stop you?

Shaw: I was curious about the outcome and had my popcorn out, duh. Problem?

AK-12: "But you don't seem. Particularly. Happy."

AK-12: "Did you. Want me. To lose."

Shaw: Don't be ridiculous.

Shaw: You are both my masterpieces. Whichever one of you wins will only prove how brilliant my design is.

Shaw: A sparring contest like this every once in a while can be quite entertaining.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 looks at Shaw and slowly closes her eyes.

Her reaction and ambiguous half-smile are a bit unnerving even for Shaw.

She finds it unsettling how her own creation seems to be seeing right through her.

Shaw: ...I am curious, though.

Shaw: I wouldn't be surprised if it had been anything else, but AK-15 actually lost in hand-to-hand combat... I must admit you've left me quite astonished. How did you beat her?

AK-12: "Strategy".

AK-12: "Psychology".

AK-12 waves her hand impatiently. She seems to have finally grown tired of this method of communication. She gets to her feet.

"Nadia": "I tricked her with a ploy and took advantage of her over-confidence."

"Nadia": "She never considered the possibility of losing. She had absolute faith in her strength and invincibility, yet she did not understand that strength wasn't everything."

"Nadia": "...Even if I hadn't beaten her, she would experience defeat eventually."

"Nadia": "She does not understand human nature, but she is still a Doll."

"Nadia": ...This is what AK-12 wishes to communicate to you.

Shaw: ...

AK-12 watches while Shaw mulls over her answer. She walks past Shaw and heads back to the repair workshop.

Shaw stands rooted to the spot as she silently peers down at AK-15, who is still lying on the floor.

Shaw: Artificial intelligence sure is frightening, Nadia.

"Nadia": I cannot comment on that, Doctor Shaw.

"Nadia": But I can assure you—you have our absolute loyalty.

Shaw: ...Oh, are you quaking in your boots, Nadenka?

Shaw: Don't worry, I'm not going to do anything... In fact, I'm looking forward to the day you defy me.

Shaw slowly turns around and waves her hand at the air.

Shaw: Clean up AK-15's body and send her to the workshop.

Shaw: I... have some thinking to do.

"Nadia": Yes, my lady.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

...

Bam!!

With a single punch, AK-15 sends the reinforced punch bag careening across the room, leaving iron sand all over the floor.

AN-94 gapes a little at this display of power. She leans down to dust off some of the sand that has got onto her shoes. Then she straightens up again and heads over to check AK-15's arm.

AN-94: It's holding up nicely.

AN-94: Final parameter recorded. Your modification has been a great success, 15.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 nods briefly as she gazes at the sand still leaking out of the punch bag. Then her eyes suddenly shift over to AN-94.

AK-15: AK-12 is an outstanding Tactical Doll.

AN-94: ...Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

AK-15: Do you trust her?

AK-15 ignores AN-94's question and asks a question of her own.

AN-94 stares at her uncertainly. After a brief moment of silence, she finally gives her reply.

AN-94: Of course. She is my most trusty partner.

AK-15: ...

RPK-16: Do you trust me, 15?

AK-15: ...

AN-94: ...So what's this all about?

AK-15: I'm a bit jealous.

AK-15: Of your pairing.

AN-94: You... What? What did you just say?!

...

After the devastating failure of "Incident Zero", the Wolf Pack Project comes under heavy scrutiny and criticism.

But under the leadership of senior agent "Angelia", the two-Doll team that comprises AK-12 and AN-94 remains active across multiple areas, completing a myriad of missions that would have been impossible for regular agents.

And thus, not long after the scandal, the Wolf Pack Project once again gains acknowledgment and support, and is able to continue with the investors' backing.

AK-12: Crap!

AK-15: —!

AK-15 delivers a ruthless and decisive kick, breaking AK-12's body clean into two.

She steadies herself. Her body is also covered in injuries. Her gun is out of ammo, and her knife bent and useless. She is quite literally spent.

"Nadia": Simulation over. The winner is AK-15.

"Nadia": Congratulations on yet another victory.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 opens her eyes. The shattered remains of AK-12 and the rocky mountain terrain have both vanished without a trace, and she is once again back at Statesec.

Ever since she suffered the defeat at AK-12's hands, she has been undergoing this kind of neural simulation training.

AK-15: Not good enough.

"Nadia": Pardon?

AK-15: AK-12 is more cunning than this.

"Nadia": Maybe you have just grown acclimatized due to your continuous training.

"Nadia": I am rather amazed that you've kept at it without stopping for so long.

"Nadia": Is this some sort of vengeful self-punishment?

AK-15: ...

"Nadia": Apologies, I was out of line.

AK-15: Any notice from Doctor Shaw?

"Nadia": Notice?

AK-15: What are they planning to do with me?

"Nadia": I do not understand your question. What exactly are you talking about?

AK-15: ...

...She failed.

She lost to AK-12 in a one-to-one physical fight, which was meant to be her speciality.

AK-15: What is going to be my punishment?

"Nadia": If you are referring to the aftermath of Incident Zero, you don't have to worry.

"Nadia": AK-12 and AN-94 have since redeemed the project's reputation.

"Nadia": They are currently still on active duty under Miss Angelia's command.

AK-15: Is Shaw not disappointed in me?

"Nadia": ... Doctor Shaw is still following up on the Wolf Pack Project.

"Nadia": This is a very busy time for her. She asks for your understanding.

"Nadia": She isn't neglecting you on purpose.

AK-15: I'm just a T-Doll. All I need is orders to obey.

AK-15: I'm only interested in how she intends to use me from now on.

"Nadia": That will have to wait until Doctor Shaw is done with her current work.

"Nadia": ...AK-15, you were never this restless before.

"Nadia": What happened?

AK-15: I'm not restless.

AK-15: I'm just disappointed in myself.

"Nadia": Disappointed?

AK-15: I failed to meet Doctor Shaw's expectations as a weapon.

"Nadia": I think you are a very successful T-Doll, AK-15.

"Nadia": I participated in the design and production process of all three of you. You are different from AN-94 and AK-12.

"Nadia": Shaw spent the most effort on you. She expects a lot from you.

AK-15: I'm not as well-rounded and versatile as AK-12.

AK-15: So as a weapon, I should not lose—I cannot afford to.

"Nadia": You are hampered by your reputation as "the most powerful T-Doll", AK-15.

AK-15: No, I'm just stating a fact.

AK-15: I have to be the most powerful T-Doll—as I've always been.

"Nadia": But...

AK-15: ...

"Nadia": ...15?

AK-15: I'm still not strong enough, Nadia.

After taking a deep breath, AK-15 gets up from her seat and starts inputting data for a new simulation.

AK-15: I won't let Doctor Shaw down again.

"Nadia": ...You won't, AK-15.

Just before she is about to restart the simulation, her hand suddenly pauses as a question occurs to her.

AK-15: What is Doctor Shaw so busy with? The Wolf Pack Project is over.

"Nadia": I cannot divulge any information pertaining to this matter at the moment.

"Nadia": But the Wolf Pack... No, Task Force DEFY will consist of the most exceptional T-Dolls, that I can promise you.

AK-15: ...DEFY?

"Nadia": Trust me, 15. You'll be surprised.

AK-15 grunts in confusion at the unfamiliar name, but her curiosity remains unsatisfied.

AK-15: ...

...There is still time. She still has a chance.

...

In the lab.

Shaw: Can you move it?

Angelia: ...

Angelia flings herself off the surgical bench and flexes her brand-new artificial arm made of alloy.

Angelia: Not bad. I came fully prepared to lose another arm.

Angelia: Also, while I don't really care about cosmetics, can't you at least make it look... less clunky?

Shaw: I'm a Slav. This is our style.

Shaw: If you're not happy with it, go find someone else. Or better yet, don't lose your limb to begin with.

Angelia: You think I could help it?

Shaw waves her hand dismissively and plops herself down on her chair.

Ange glances at her, then peers across the room at the workbench, which is currently unoccupied but otherwise covered in all sorts of parts.

Angelia: So, what are you up to?

Shaw: I have a new idea.

Angelia: Oh?

Shaw: Something better than AK-12... No, maybe not better, but it's certainly worth a try.

Shaw: Aren't you always preaching to me that Dolls shouldn't be just weapons? It'll be different this time, Anna.

Shaw: She'll be the manifestation of all my design concepts. She may even... make my dream come true.

Angelia: ...I have a feeling I'm inviting trouble, but just out of curiosity, what is your dream?

Shaw: To defy—

A sudden knock on the door interrupts Shaw.

The two women look toward the door at the same time. AK-15 enters the lab silently.

Angelia: ...Looks like your next client is here.

Angelia: I'll be off then. Gotta go and quit my job first.

Shaw: Show yourself out.

After seeing off Ange, who brushes past AK-15 on her way out, Shaw's gaze finally rests on the Doll.

Shaw: Yes?

AK-15: I need a partner.

AK-15 looks steadily at Shaw, her crimson eyes flashing sharply.

Shaw: A partner?

Shaw: That's rich coming from someone who just backed out of a partnership.

Shaw: ...What brought this on?

AK-15: Incident Zero...

Shaw: Hm?

AK-15: ...Incident Zero would not have been such a catastrophic failure if I had a commander who could put my abilities to effective use.

Shaw: You want a partner who can sort out everything and make all the decisions for you so that you can focus on fighting and don't have to worry about anything else?

Shaw: Don't you think you're being unrealistic?

AK-15: No.

Shaw: ...Ha, interesting.

Shaw: What makes you so sure?

AK-15 answers matter-of-factly as she takes a step back slowly and directs her gaze at the corner of the room.

AK-15: Because you have already created her.

???: ...

A silver-haired Doll strolls out with a mischievous smile from a place that escaped even Angelia's notice.

???: You really are the most powerful T-Doll in the entire Neo-Soviet Union. There's just no hiding from you, is there? What a pity, the surprise is ruined.

???: There are quite a lot of beings with clairvoyance in human mythologies, does this make you one of them?

Shaw: ...

AK-15: Half a month ago, Nadia told me you were still busy working on the Wolf Pack Project.

AK-15: But AN-94 and AK-12 have already gone into service, so you shouldn't have much demanding work.

AK-15: That is, unless you spontaneously decided to start working on a new Doll.

Shaw: Heh... Aren't you full of surprises today, Strapping Sherlock?

After making a joke at AK-15's expense, Shaw closes her eyes.

Shaw: Introductions are in order, Pan... RPK-16.

RPK-16: Pleasure to meet you, AK-15.

RPK-16: I am RPK-16, Unit 4 of the Wolf Pack Project, codename "Silver Fox". I'll be your partner.

AK-15: Unit 4... of the Wolf Pack Project?

RPK-16: Indeed. AN-94 is obviously Unit 1.

RPK-16: That makes you Unit 2, AK-12 Unit 3, and I, the youngest of the sisters, am Unit 4.

AK-15: You...

RPK-16: Yes?

AK-15: ...

Shaw: Go on, speak your mind.

Shaw: I want to know what you think.

AK-15: Your physical specs are inferior to AK-12's.

AK-15: ...You're not equipped with the Wolf Eye System either.

AK-15: Your performance doesn't even reach our average benchmark.

AK-15 is merely listing out the facts with no intention to mock or insult.

Although she has deduced RPK-16's existence, it still comes as quite a shock when she finally meets her in person.

AK-15: You... are Doctor Shaw's latest work?

RPK-16: Yes. I am her aspiration; her treatise on Dolls.

RPK-16 meets AK-15's gaze cheerfully and answers with confident certainty.

RPK-16: My creation will mark the peak of her career, and I will be the ultimate weapon for proving Persica's mistake.

RPK-16: —Does it make you feel better if I say that?

Shaw: Pffft... Humph.

Shaw: Yep, there you go, AK-15.

Shaw: This is my newest design—poor specs and full of bull.

Shaw: She doesn't even hold a candle to AK-12. If you're not happy with this partner, I'll have to think of something else.

AK-15: ...

In response to Shaw's sarcastic but loaded remark, AK-15 falls silent.

AK-15: What can you do?

RPK-16: As you wish, I will play to your strengths and make the most out of your ability.

RPK-16: I will not hold you back or give you tasks that you're not suited to... Or put it this way—you won't have to worry about anything else because I'll solve all the problems.

RPK-16: All you need to do is charge ahead and be unstoppable.

RPK-16: ...Like you've always done.

AK-15: ...Can you really do that?

RPK-16: Who knows? Maybe it was all false advertising?

With a smile, RPK-16 sticks out a hand to AK-15, the way all partnerships begin.

AK-15 scrutinizes RPK-16's face motionlessly. In the end, she takes the hand and shakes it.

RPK-16: Do you trust me, AK-15?

Her gaze never wavers.

AK-15: ...

RPK-16: Do you trust me, AK-15?

AK-15: ...I have always trusted you.

AK-15: You let me focus on being the most powerful T-Doll. I never had to worry about anything else.

AK-15: I've always trusted you, RPK. It's just like you said.

AK-15: I trusted you.

AK-15: ...

AN-94: 15?

AK-15: ...

AK-15 cuts the tape and weighs the explosives in her hand. Her clear eyes are utterly devoid of emotion.

AK-15: Last one...

AN-94: You've already made a lot of them.

AK-15: Last spot.

AK-15: ...I'm saving it for RPK.

AN-94: ...

AK-15: I must deal with her myself.

AN-94: You mustn't let your personal feelings interfere with the mission... I understand how you feel, because I also feel the same way.

AK-15: I know.

AK-15: Which is why this is the most effective solution.

AK-15: I must be the one to kill her.

AN-94: Because you're partners?

AK-15: ...Because in her eyes, I am the most powerful T-Doll.

AK-15: That's why she will never win against me. Never.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: Let's go. The Commander is summoning us.

AK-15: Right.

AK-15 stands up and pockets all the weapons she has prepared.

...She doesn't know who will be the first.

But she vows to herself that RPK-16 will be the last.

She swears.
