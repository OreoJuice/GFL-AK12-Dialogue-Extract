FF FN49: This should be my new dorm.

FF FN49: I wonder what kinds of T-Dolls my teammates will be...

FF FN49: Somebody's sitting over there... Ngh, so nervous...

FF FN49: G-guess I'll go and say hello!

FF FN49: Um, b-bonjour!

???: Ah! I found this lying around next to the cabinet! I didn't steal it -

???: Oh, you're not 57...

???: Scared the crap outta me. Who are you? Never seen you before.

FF FN49: I-I'm FF FN49... The Commander asked me to report for duty here.

???: Ooooh! So you're the newbie that arrived today!

???: I'm FF FNC. Bonjour!

FF FN49: Miss FF FNC... Um, p-pleased to make your acquaintance!

FNC: Relax, FF FN49. Wanna join me for a snack?

FF FN49: May I? I just got here...

FF FNC: We'll be mates on the battlefield from now on. Don't worry about courtesy and stuff like that.

FF FN49: Merci...

FF FN49: (Looks like I've met a really nice person.)

FF FNC: Hmm... We've checked out the command center, the training ground, and the garage.

FF FNC: Let me see. Where should we go next...?

FF FN49: I'm almost ashamed...

FF FN49: I ate your snacks and now you're showing me around the base.

FF FNC: We're all companions here. It's only right that we help each other!

FF FN49: I've met some other T-Dolls when I first got here.

FF FN49: Everyone looks incredibly strong and powerful... I don't know how to start a conversation with them.

FF FNC: Most of us are pretty approachable at the base...except for a certain few.

FF FNC: Just talk to them like normal!

FF FN49: Hmm... Thanks to you, I think I'm feeling a bit more confident.

FF FNC: Heheh, then let's get along from now on!

FF FNC: Right... Take this.

FF FN49: A...hair brush?

FF FNC: You have such nice hair. I think it'll be perfect for you.

FF FNC: So I'm giving it to you!

FF FN49: Can I...really take this?

FF FNC: Bien sur. Think of it as a welcome gift.

FF FN49: Merci...

FF FN49: I'm so glad I met you so soon after I got here.

FF FNC: Heheh. Now let's head to our next stop!

FF FN49: So...I guess I've made a friend?

FF FN49: What is this place?

FF FNC: This is the warehouse where our supplies are stored!

FF FNC: There's lots of good food in here.

FF FNC: See the chocolate bars on the shelf over there? Let's get two!

FF FN49: But isn't it bad...

FF FN49: To take things from the warehouse without permission...?

FF FNC: This is special welfare for newbies!

FF FNC: I wouldn't tell just anyone about this.

FF FN49: R-really?

FF FN49: But...

FF FNC: No buts.

FF FNC: No one will notice two missing chocolate bars.

FF FNC: Hurry. I'll keep watch!

FF FN49: Okay...

...

FF FNC: Mmmmm, yummy...

FF FNC: Chocolate is the tastiest thing in the world!

FF FN49: FF FNC... I don't really like this...

FF FN49: It feels like stealing...

Commander: You two, what are you doing here?

FF FN49: C-C-C-Commander?!

Commander: Where did you get the chocolate?

FF FN49: These...um...we...

FF FNC: Commander, 49 gave it to me!

FF FN49: FF FNC?! You...

Commander: These are our new supplies from the warehouse.

Commander: How could you take them without permission, FF FN49?

FF FN49: But I...

FF FN49: Commander, i-it was FF FNC who...

FF FN49: FF FNC?

FF FNC has vanished into thin air.

FF FN49: Why...

FF FN49: FF FNC! Where were you just now?!

FF FNC: There didn't seem to be anything that concerned me so I came back.

FF FN49: Ughh... I was admonished severely by the Commander.

FF FN49: It was you who made me do it. Why did you leave me there on my own...?

FF FN49: You were planning to steal the chocolate bars from the start, weren't you?!

FF FNC: Eating great stuff is worth being told off, right?

FF FNC: You had some too, 49, so that makes us friends, ouais?

FF FNC: Then cut me some slack!

FF FN49: You...

FF FNC: Hmm...is there anything else you'd like to eat?

FF FNC: I can take you with me!

FF FN49: ...Not really.

FF FN49: I...I need to rest.

...

FF FN49: She doesn't seem sorry at all...

FF FN49: I'm upset...and a bit mad too...

FF FN49: But...how do I tell her...?

FF FN49: Miss Five-seven, here...

FF FN49: This is my surveillance report for today.

Five-seven: Bien. Let me see.

Five-seven: Hmm... This is pretty good for your first time.

FF FN49: M-merci...

FF FN49: Um... Is there anything I can improve on?

Five-seven: This report is perfectly adequate.

Five-seven: FF FN49, you take your assignments seriously and are very meticulous.

Five-seven: If I must point out something you should work on...

Five-seven: It would be your lack of self-confidence and the will to persist through difficulties.

FF FN49: Huh?

Five-seven: You did very well.

Five-seven: That's why you should've submitted the report with more pride.

FF FN49: I-I see!

FF FN49: I will definitely work on that...

Five-seven: That roommate of yours may be a bit of a simpleton, but that has its own merits.

Five-seven: Your complementary personalities make it perfect for the two of you to learn from each other.

Five-seven: I suppose that's why the Commander put you in the same team.

FF FN49: ...Is that so?

FF FN49: Actually, I-I'm not entirely sure how to get on with FF FNC.

FF FN49: Not to mention learning from her...

Five-seven: Did something happen between you two?

FF FN49: She's always making fun of me...

FF FN49: It's pretty harmless most of the time, but she doesn't seem to care at all...

Five-seven: FF FNC...can indeed be impertinent.

Five-seven: I think she's bullying you because you never fight back.

Five-seven: The Commander has lectured her a couple of times but she isn't one to realize her own faults.

Five-seven: So in this regard...you're on your own.

FF FN49: But I-I don't know what to do...

Five-seven: Think of it as a long-term assignment.

Five-seven: If you can sort out this troublemaker, you might be able to learn a thing or two yourself.

Five-seven: But can I...really do it?

Five-seven: If you want to stay in Griffin, you "have to" do it.

Five-seven: Like I said, have more faith in yourself.

Five-seven: Besides, I think you can do it...

Five-seven: And I have a good eye for many things.

FF FN49: Alright...Miss Five-seven.

FF FN49: I'll do my best...

FF FN49: Sigh...

FF FN49: Why must I make friends with someone like her...?

Griffin forces in combat.

Griffin T-Doll: Hurry! Get her somewhere safe!

Griffin T-Doll: Be careful! This bit is falling off!

Griffin T-Doll: Where's the emergency repair kit? Did anyone bring it?!

Griffin T-Doll: This won't do. The circuitry is completely fried...

FF FNC: How could this be...

Five-seven: Aren't you going to help, FF FNC?

FF FNC: ...Why should I?

Five-seven: FF FN49 got this badly injured giving you cover.

FF FNC: I...I didn't ask her to come save me!

Five-seven: She was willing to come out and save your back even though she'd been taking so much of your crap.

Five-seven: Even if we don't consider that...

Five-seven: Shouldn't you at least help your saviour out of simple gratitude?

FF FNC: That's her own fault and n-none of my business!

FF FNC runs off.

Five-seven: My, my... That's horrible, FF FNC.

Three days later.

FF FNC: FF FN49 still hasn't come back...

FF FNC: Why are her repairs taking so long...?

FF FNC: Maybe I should ask around.

FF FNC: 57! Are you there?!

Five-seven: FF FNC? How unexpected.

Five-seven: How may I help?

FF FNC: I'm just wondering... Is 49 still not done with her repairs?

Five-seven: Miss FF FN49, huh...

Five-seven: She was too severely damaged during the last mission and has been disassembled for reconstruction. Let's see...

Five-seven: It's almost time. A brand new FF FN49 should be reporting for duty pretty soon.

FF FNC: What...

FF FNC: What do you mean?!

Five-seven: That's right, your doting friend has completely forgotten about you.

Five-seven: You'd better start preparing a new self-introduction for later when you meet.

FF FNC: Liar! You're lying!!

FF FNC: Our neural clouds can be backed up!

Five-seven: Her neural cloud was filled with unpleasant memories the day she joined us.

Five-seven: Do you think she would've backed them up properly?

FF FNC: ...

Five-seven: I have some business to attend to.

Five-seven: You'll have to stay here or Miss FF FN49 will have to wait outside the door.

Five-seven saunters out of the room.

FF FNC: ...How did this happen?

FF FNC: 49... (sobs)

???: Um... Excuse me...

FF FNC: Oh?

FF FNC: You're...

FF FN49: I'm FF FN49...reporting for duty today.

FF FN49: Nice to meet you!

FF FN49: May I ask who...?

FF FNC: I'm...I'm FF FNC...

FF FNC: (Sobs) I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

FF FNC: FF FN49, I'm sorry...

FF FN49: H-hold on...

FF FN49: Please don't cry...

FF FNC: I was always making fun of you...and making you take the blame for what I did...

FF FNC: I'm sorry...

FF FN49: Um, it's okay...

FF FN49: I don't remember anything from before.

FF FNC: I don't care if you remember or not... (sobs)

FF FNC: Is it too late for us to become friends again?

FF FN49: Bien sur. It's never too late.

FF FN49 gives the hair brush in her hand a little wave.

FF FNC: ...Huh?

FF FNC: That's...

FF FN49: A welcome gift from you.

FF FN49: Sorry, I was just pulling your leg.

FF FN49: My neural cloud record is fully intact.

FF FNC: So you actually remember... That's fantastic...

FF FNC: But that hair brush is just some cheap stuff that I meant to throw away the other day... You don't have to cherish it...

Five-seven: What a touching reunion.

Five-seven: Now can we all get along nicely?

FF FNC: Oui!

FF FNC: FF FN49...let's be good friends for real this time!

FF FNC offers her right hand.

FF FN49: Before that...

Smack!

FF FN49 grabs FF FNC's hand and whacks her palm hard with the hair brush.

FF FNC: Ouch! W-what was that for?!

Five-seven: Hmm. This wasn't included in what we discussed beforehand.

FF FN49: FF FNC, I can certainly forgive you...

FF FN49: But my forgiveness has to be earned!

FF FNC: FF FN49...

FF FN49: I'm sorry. I'm not actually a squishy goody-two-shoes, nor am I an insensitive block of wood.

FF FN49: I, too, get upset and mad when I'm bullied and misunderstood!

FF FN49: E-even I would feel wronged and lose my temper...

FF FN49: If you're just looking for another bullying victim, you'll have to look elsewhere!

FF FNC: I'm sorry... FF FN49...

FF FNC: I was wrong. I'll never bully you again...

FF FNC: Please, let's be friends and have fun together!

FF FN49: Hmm... If it's a FRIEND you're looking for...

FF FN49: You'll have to accept this side of me as well.

FF FNC: (Nods) I will!

FF FNC: A...anything else?

FF FN49: No.

FF FNC: No?

FF FN49 grins and gives FF FNC a hug.

FF FN49: Nothing else...

FF FN49: From now on, let's be friends for real.
Part 4

FF FNC: Sigh. FF FN49 didn't come back today either...

FF FNC: She didn't even tell me when she left. What on earth is she up to?

FF FNC: Now that I think about it...she's been avoiding me these days.

FF FNC: But we have no reason to fight anymore, so why...?

: ...The door rattles.

???: Hmm? The door is locked?

???: What are you still doing here, FF FNC?

FF FNC: It's 49! You're back! I'll get the door!

FF FN49: Seriously...

FF FN49: I heard 57 had arranged a training session for you today... Are you ditching again?

FF FNC: Just sneaking off occasionally. You know me!

...FF FNC opens the door.

FF FN49: I know we're supposed to help each other out, but 57 is asking about you every day. I can only make so many excuses here...

FF FNC: Hmm...?

FF FNC: Huhhhhhhhh??!!

FF FNC: FF FN49! What...what the heck happened to you?!

FF FN49: Heheh, you like it?

FF FN49: The Commander had filed me in for a Neural Upgrade because of my satisfactory performance recently!

FF FN49: I'd actually learned about it a long time ago, but I wanted to give you a surprise so I never told you.

FF FNC: So THIS is why you've been missing for days!

FF FNC: That's unfair! Not only are you stronger, even your clothes look nicer...

FF FNC: I'm already the short one. Now you're gonna be getting ALL the attention!

FF FN49: If you don't want to be overshadowed, you'd better start training hard.

FF FN49: If you do well, you could very well be recommended for the upgrade, too.

FF FNC: Huh? Shouldn't you be more benevolent after the Neural Upgrade?!

FF FNC: It's fine as long as you're here even if I slack off a bit, right?

FF FN49: No can do.

FF FN49: If you want to keep up with me, then GET. UP. THIS. INSTANT.

FF FN49: You see this hair brush? It's a symbol of our friendship...

FF FN49: However, if you slack off, it'll turn into a whip to beat you into shape!

FF FNC: Whoaaaaaaa!

FF FNC: Spare meeeeeee, 49! Nooooooooooo!!

Outside the dorm room.

Five-seven: My, FF FN49 really has learned a thing or two...

Five-seven: She's even developed a menacing side...

Five-seven: Oh dear... Poor FF FNC. Friendship really is something one needs to cultivate with caution.
