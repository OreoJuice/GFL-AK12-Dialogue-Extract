...

Welrod MkII: Listen, it was not your fault, you just so happened to be the one who encountered the problem.

Bren: I disagree.

Bren: She actually had to rely on a human stranger to salvage the mission – how was that different from failing the mission?

Bren: The reshuffling is obviously punishment for her blunder, plain and simple.

L85A1: But our options were limited to begin with...

L85A1: With our comms modules malfunctioning, if it hadn't been for the human's aid...

Bren: It is never practical to pin your hopes on “humanity”, L85.

Bren: The only thing we can truly rely on is our own strength.

L85A1: But under such dire circumstances...

Bren: Say, we can't use our core directive as an excuse for everything.

Bren: We should've come up with a suitable solution on the spot.

Welrod MkII: Bren, L85, is this really the time to argue?

Welrod MkII: What's past is past. The goddess of victory will not smile upon those who refuse to move on.

???: ...TEN...

L85A1: Sigh...

L85A1: If you can ever find the time, make sure you drop in and have some tea with us.

Bren: Now don't look so sad... changing of station happens all the time.

Bren: If you want to see us, you are always welcome to come and visit us when you're on holiday.

Bren: I just hope whoever they're sending to replace you won't be a troublemaker.

???: ...STEN...

Welrod MkII: May the light of victory always shine upon you, my friend.

STEN!

STEN MkII: Whoa!!

AAT-52: Hahahaha, still spacing out?!

AAT-52: You just joined a new echelon! You're not leaving a good first impression, you know?

STEN MkII: I...

STEN MkII: I just remembered...

AAT-52: Remembered what? Did you leave your makeup case behind?

STEN MkII: No!

STEN MkII: I just remembered...

STEN MkII: There were a lot of things that I didn't get to tell the others before I left...

AAT-52: Ha...

STEN MkII: It's stupid of me to keep dwelling on this, isn't it?

AAT-52: I mean, it won't be nice of me to say, “I honestly don't get why you're so sad” to your face...

STEN MkII: But you just did...

AAT-52: Heh, we haven't been fired. We just got moved somewhere else.

STEN MkII: You mean we got “sent away”...

AAT-52: In any case, we're still part of Griffin, so what difference does it make?

AAT-52: I'd be more concerned about whether there will be long queues at the cafeteria at the new place.

STEN MkII: I...just feel really bad...

STEN MkII: Bren said the mission basically ended in failure because I asked a human for help...

STEN MkII: The Commander must've thought the same, or I wouldn't have been sent to a place where I won't be a hindrance.

AAT-52: Huh? So you're saying I'm also a lousy Doll because I got sent here along with you?

STEN MkII: N-no, that's not what I meant!

AAT-52: Humph! Whatever, I don't waste my time worrying about stuff.

AAT-52: What's the point, anyway? They must have their reasons.

AAT-52: I for one don't think the Commander would call for a reshuffling over something so trivial.

STEN MkII: I'm...not so sure.

AAT-52: Then what do you think? About the mission, I mean.

AAT-52: Do you believe you made the wrong decision back then?

STEN MkII: I...

STEN MkII: No, I am very grateful to the human who helped me out, though I never saw him again...

AAT-52: See? You already have your own answer.

AAT-52: Though I find it a bit unusual for a human to render aid to a Doll... Isn't it usually the other way round?

STEN MkII: It was a bit strange, but isn't the Commander always helping us?!

AAT-52: Well, there you have it! Think about how the Commander is always taking care of us.

AAT-52: It's perfectly normal for Dolls to ask humans for help when we're in trouble, so why should a Doll be punished for following a human's instructions?!

STEN MkII: You're right... The stories we see on the news are usually about Dolls disobeying their humans or things turning out badly because a Doll decided to take matters into her own hands...

STEN MkII: Which means...I didn't actually do anything wrong...

AAT-52: It was perfectly fine to begin with.

AAT-52: A human who dislikes Dolls won't even bother to acknowledge your presence. Have you ever met a human like that?

STEN MkII: No...all the humans I've met were very friendly.

STEN MkII: Alright, I think I understand... There's nothing to worry about.

AAT-52: Heh, that's the spirit! No point in moping about!

AAT-52: Now let's go see our new leader and report for duty.

...

STEN MkII: We help humans, so in return, humans are also happy to help us.

STEN MkII: Relying on humans isn't a bad thing, so...Bren was wrong!

STEN MkII: After all...most humans are like the Commander...

STEN MkII: That...must be the case...
Part 2

...

STEN MkII: (Pants) Where did they go?

STEN MkII: I didn't lose them, did I...? Wait, why is someone on their own...?

...A shadow flits around the corner across the street.

STEN MkII: Found you!

STEN MkII: Wait!!

STEN MkII: Ugh... There are more and more S.F. around...

STEN MkII: Where...exactly am I...?

...Click.

AAT-52: STEN, bad news!

STEN MkII: Huh?! W-what's wrong? Don't scare me!

AAT-52: We just arrived at the shelter, but it's already deserted.

AAT-52: We have no idea where Document 36 is!

STEN MkII: It's gone?

STEN MkII: Then...what are Miss RO's instructions...?

AAT-52: She can't seem to make up her mind either...

AAT-52: (Whispers) It's freezing in here... If you haven't discovered anything on your end either, does this mean we can withdraw?

STEN MkII: Don't give me any of that!

STEN MkII: I just saw a human while I was running some recon. I'm tailing him at the moment...

STEN MkII: We can't just leave him on his own in this dangerous city.

AAT-52: What? How do you know you aren't following some kind of Sangvis bait?

STEN MkII: I'm not. I've verified the data and his identity!

AAT-52: Just be careful... Hold on...

AAT-52: There's nobody in the shelter, and you're pursuing the only human in the neighborhood...

AAT-52: In other words...

STEN MkII: In other words...?

AAT-52: Document 36!!!

AAT-52: Quick, report your findings to RO! Document 36 could very well be in that guy's possession!

AAT-52: Heheh, the success of our mission rests entirely on you!

...Transmission terminated.

STEN MkII: Huh?? But wait! You can't just...

...The line is already dead.

STEN MkII: Alright... STEN, don't be afraid, you can do this...

STEN MkII: Humans are all kind like the Commander. Just explain the situation, I'm sure he'll help... It'll all be fine!

STEN MkII: Is-is anybody there?

...

STEN MkII: Can you hear me?

???: Stay away from me!

STEN MkII: But... Hold on, I'm not from Sangvis Ferri!

STEN MkII: I work for the PMC Griffin & Kryuger. My name is STEN MkII.

Male Human: Griffin...?

...A man pokes his head out from behind the door and gives STEN a once-over.

STEN MkII: I'm not going to hurt you.

Male Human: You're armed... Wait a minute...

Male Human: Have we met...?

STEN MkII: Huh?

Male Human: There was a traffic accident on the highway a few weeks ago... A girl with a red beret jumped in front of my car and stopped me...

Male Human: That was you, wasn't it? You're the girl?

STEN MkII: Huh...? Don't tell me...?

STEN accesses her neural cloud records.

STEN MkII: Huh?? That-that's right!

STEN MkII: So...you're the man who helped me back then...

STEN MkII: I didn't record too many details... I...

Male Human: So you're a Griffin android, huh. Goddammit, if I'd known, I wouldn't have...

Male Human: Still...what are you doing here?

STEN MkII: We've come to retrieve a document. I must also escort you to safety.

Male Human: Document? What document?

STEN MkII: Document 36. It contains information that's very important to us.

...

Male Human: Document 36...

STEN MkII: That's right. Um...are you aware of its whereabouts?

Male Human: No, never heard of it.

Male Human: Look for it somewhere else.

STEN MkII: Huh?

STEN MkII: ...

STEN MkII: But my teammate just told me...

Male Human: Are you questioning me, Doll?

STEN MkII: N-not at all... But AAT-52 did say the document was most probably...

Male Human: Wherever it is, it's got nothing to do with me!

STEN MkII: My scanner indicates that your heartbeat is accelerating...

STEN MkII: Mr. Human, could you...be lying?

Male Human: I told you already, I don't know anything!

Male Human: You'd better head back to your warehouse already!

STEN MkII: I'm sorry, are you trying to hide the fact that you know the location of Document 36...?

STEN MkII: But...why?

Male Human: Is something wrong with your head – I mean, neural cloud?! Don't you understand what I'm saying?!

STEN MkII: B-but...

Male Human: Alright... I hear that unlike the Sangvis Dolls out there, you Griffin Dolls still obey commands given by humans?

STEN MkII: That is correct... But—

Male Human: Then I now refuse to answer any of your questions, and I forbid you to pester me about it any further!

STEN MkII: No, please...!

STEN MkII: We really need to retrieve that document... It's all we need...

Screw off!

...Bang!

...The man locks himself inside the office and gives no further response.

...

STEN MkII: You helped me before...

STEN MkII: So why...?
Part 3

...

RO635: ...

RO635: STEN, lie low for now and observe his movements.

RO635: Our teams will get there as soon as we can to sort things out.

RO635: ...If the human tries to run, please pin him down by force.

STEN MkII: Huh? Is...that necessary? Won't that be too risky?

AAT-52: RO, have you forgotten again? Unless given special permission by a superior, we can't...

RO635: I AM your superior, and I'm granting you special permission to do so.

RO635: But take note, if your life is at stake, prioritize your own survival. Rescue others only when the situation allows.

STEN MkII: Roger. I'll go look for a place to hide now. Please send reinforcements soon, Miss RO.

...

STEN MkII: How did it turn out this way...?

STEN MkII: Didn't he help me before...?

STEN MkII: Is he not...a good person?

...STEN crouches quietly in the corner of the office building, keeping an eye on her surroundings as she waits in front of the locked door.

STEN MkII: Is he still in there?

STEN MkII: Could he actually know where Document 36 is but...

...

STEN MkII: (What's that huge piece of equipment that Sangvis Ferri has installed outside...?)

STEN MkII: (Hm, now that I look at it more carefully, that long tube looks kind of like a barrel!)

STEN MkII: ...

STEN MkII: Huh?

STEN MkII: It-it's turning this way?

STEN MkII: W-w-w-w-wait a minute!

...BOOM!

...

STEN MkII: Cough...cough...

STEN MkII: W-what just happened...?

...The artillery fire has blown a large hole in the outer wall of the entire office building. The empty city outside is burning in a sea of fire.

STEN MkII: No way...

Male Human: (Groans)

...The locked door is blown right off its hinges.

...Inside the ravaged office, the man is lying on the ground, blood gushing out of his abdomen.

STEN MkII: Oh no!

Male Human: Arghhhh... It hurts...

STEN MkII: Are you alright?!

STEN MkII: I-I'm going to administer some first-aid treatment on your injuries. When that's done, hold onto me and I'll carry you out of here!

Male Human: ...What...are you talking about?

STEN MkII: You're very badly injured. I'm going to get you—

Male Human: Ha, it must be one of those stupid commands again...

Male Human: Something like, “A Doll must assist any human whose life is in danger...”

Male Human: Save it...and mind your own business.

STEN MkII: I can't!

STEN MkII: If we can get you to a medical facility right now, you can still make it! You can't give up just like that!

Male Human: What do you know?

Male Human: Still...it's good that you're here. I need you to do something for me.

STEN MkII: What is it? I'll do it!

Male Human: Good... You see that hidden compartment in there?

STEN MkII: ...I see it! What should I do next?

Male Human: Find the Document 36 that you're after, then destroy it.

STEN MkII: Understood... Huh? Hold on... What did you just say??

Male Human: Something wrong with your ears?

Male Human: I am ordering you as a human – stop trying to save me and destroy Document 36 immediately.

STEN MkII: Stop trying to save you...and destroy...

STEN MkII: But the document contains a lot of criminal records! Without this document...

Male Human: I'm not asking your opinion.

STEN MkII: I can't do this!

STEN MkII: This isn't right!

Male Human: You owe me a favor, and I know you still remember it!

Male Human: You Dolls...must obey humans!

STEN MkII: No, it's not right... It shouldn't be like this...

STEN MkII: It can't be like this...

Male Human: ...

STEN MkII: Sir?

STEN MkII: Sir!

...The man has lost consciousness.

STEN MkII: W-what should I do...?

STEN MkII: I can't... I can't...

STEN MkII: What am I supposed to do right now...?

STEN MkII: AAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!

...

RO635: Miss STEN!

STEN MkII: ...

STEN MkII: I'm sorry, Miss RO...

STEN MkII: I can't give it to you.

RO635: What?!

RO635: What did you say, Miss STEN?!

STEN MkII: The human asked me just before he passed out...

STEN MkII: To destroy the document...

RO635: ...

RO635: I'm asking you to give me the document. That's an order!

STEN MkII: But the human also gave me an order...

STEN MkII: According to Griffin's contract, I must help humans whose lives are in peril...

RO635: That's the clause he's exploiting, Miss STEN.

RO635: Let me tell you, that guy is an administrator of a criminal syndicate!

RO635: And you know full well that Document 36 contains a large amount of criminal records! You can't do evil things for him!

STEN MkII: This isn't a matter of good and evil... I don't want to be an accomplice in criminal activities either, Miss RO...

STEN MkII: But as a T-Doll, I don't have a choice...

STEN MkII: As they say, we may not injure any human beings and must obey orders given by them...

RO635: Fuck the Laws of Robotics!

RO635: That's some science fiction from a hundred years ago, and we're in reality now!

RO635: We are not servants of mankind! I'm giving you special permission...

RO635: No, I'm giving you a direct order to disobey his order!

STEN MkII: Can...can you do that?

STEN MkII: Can you make me...disobey that order?

STEN MkII: But Griffin T-Dolls don't usually possess authorization higher than that of human beings...

RO635: I can, because...I'm special.

RO635: I've retained my authorization from before I came to Griffin...

RO635: ...And this is precisely the reason why I've returned.

RO635: Listen to me, Miss STEN.

RO635: I need you to preserve Document 36 and bring it to me – all of it.

RO635: I've authorized you to do so. You can do it if you just believe in yourself...

STEN MkII: Un...understood...

...

AAT-52: STEN!!

AAT-52: We finally found you! You aren't missing any parts, are you?

STEN MkII: ...

AAT-52: ...STEN? You alright?

STEN MkII: I don't get it...

AAT-52: What is it? What happened to you?

STEN MkII: This defies my understanding...

STEN MkII: Aren't humans who are happy to help Dolls...good people?

STEN MkII: Humans are our creators, so...isn't following their orders...the right thing to do?

AAT-52: Well...I'm not entirely sure myself...

STEN MkII: If those previous statements are correct...

STEN MkII: Then are the humans...wrong?

RO635: Your statements are both correct...and incorrect.

STEN MkII: Miss RO...

RO635: AAT-52, regroup with Makarov first. We'll be there right away.

AAT-52: ...Okay.

RO635: I'm sorry, STEN... When I ordered you to stand by in position, I never expected things to go this way...

RO635: I wasn't careful enough when I evaluated the situation... It was my mistake.

STEN MkII: The man... His injuries...

RO635: Type 92 is taking care of him. His condition is now stable.

RO635: The chopper is also on its way, so don't worry.

STEN MkII: I almost...ruined the entire mission...

RO635: But we made it in time, and now we've successfully retrieved Document 36 in its entirety.

RO635: You did very well, STEN.

STEN MkII: But why did the human...

STEN MkII: Why did he ask me to do that...? He knew it was illegal...

RO635: ...

RO635: AAT-52 told me you'd met this man before?

STEN MkII: Yes...

STEN MkII: Several weeks ago, there was a traffic accident on the highway when I was escorting a client... The car rolled over.

STEN MkII: Back then, I was the only one at the scene... I couldn't contact the others, the Commander...or even Bren.

RO635: How did he help you?

STEN MkII: I had no way of extracting the trapped client from the mangled car without hurting him...

STEN MkII: I needed...human instructions...

RO635: ...

STEN MkII: The man directed me as I rescued our client and I did everything he told me to without a second thought...

STEN MkII: But this time...I really couldn't...

RO635: ...

RO635: You made the right call in both cases.

STEN MkII: But we civilian Dolls must never disobey orders given by humans...

STEN MkII: We...are not like you, Miss RO... You're “special”.

RO635: We are all “special”, that's why we all rally beneath Griffin's banner.

RO635: The way I see it, you handled the situation better than I did.

STEN MkII: But I almost...destroyed the—

RO635: Yet you didn't, did you?

RO635: You hesitated because you have goodness inside you. That is a very valuable trait in humans and Dolls alike.

STEN MkII: Isn't it possible...that I only wavered because Document 36 is so important?

RO635: I don't think so.

RO635: You questioned his order because you knew it was wrong, and you stood your ground.

STEN MkII: But if he had asked me to do any other thing...I might actually...

RO635: If his order had sat well with you, what reason would you have to disobey him?

STEN MkII: But...

RO635: Unlike their own creations, there is no clear-cut way of telling good and bad people apart when it comes to humans.

RO635: Just because the man helped you in your hour of need doesn't negate the fact that he's an administrator of a criminal syndicate who tried to destroy key evidence.

STEN MkII: If there's no clear-cut way of telling them apart...then how do I know for sure if I'm making the right choice...?

RO635: Simple. You rely on this.

...RO points at STEN's chest.

STEN MkII: ...

STEN MkII: On my kinetics module?

STEN MkII: Isn't that a bit too taxing on those parts...?

RO635: Your kinetics module is there, yes, but that's not what I'm talking about!

RO635: What I mean is your conscience.

STEN MkII: Making judgment based on a Doll's own moral compass...? Is that really okay?

STEN MkII: If I'm also flawed...

RO635: Good people can also be cruel, while bad people can feel shame.

RO635: The only thing that will never fail to differentiate between good and evil...is justice.

STEN MkII: Justice... Most people at the base would scoff at the word...

RO635: But not only does it actually exist, it will always prevail. At least, that's what I believe.

RO635: ...

RO635: Could you promise me something, Miss STEN?

RO635: Promise me that no matter what happens down the road, no matter what darkness you're faced with... Never give up on what you believe is right.

STEN MkII: ...I...

STEN MkII: I don't know...

RO635: ...

RO635: True, a verbal promise won't be enough.

RO635: To safeguard justice, you'll need more than that... If what just happened was any indication.

STEN MkII: More...than that?

RO635: We will have to go our separate ways soon...tomorrow, if not tonight.

RO635: I want you to take this. Think of it as my blessing.

RO635: I hope that one day, you can proudly proclaim your conviction...as well as your decision.

...

Male Human: ...Hm?

Male Human: I'm...still alive?

Type 92: Not only that, you're being escorted.

Type 92: We can guarantee safe passage out of this city, but who knows where they'll send you afterwards? After all, I'm sure Document 36 doesn't tell the whole story.

Male Human: Urk... Why is that thing still in one piece?!

Male Human: Doll! Where's the Doll in the red jacket?

STEN MkII: ...I'm here.

Male Human: Why are you just standing there?

Male Human: I clearly told you to destroy that document and leave me where I was!

Male Human: Hurry up! If you go back and do that now—

STEN MkII: I will do no such thing.

Male Human: What?

STEN MkII: I will not execute such malicious commands, nor will I leave a severely injured man behind.

Male Human: So you're defying humans? You freaking robots!

Type 92: (Whispers) STEN... Want me to call RO over?

STEN MkII: That won't be necessary.

STEN MkII: I...no longer feel lost.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

...Back in Griffin's base.

AAT-52: Not fair!

AAT-52: That's so disproportionate!

Commander: What's disproportionate?

AAT-52: I'm talking about STEN!

AAT-52: RO only wished me good luck before she left, but look at what she did for STEN!

Commander: Well, think of it this way.

Commander: STEN has had an incredibly long streak of bad luck.

Commander: Let her have her moment, just this once.

AAT-52: But I also want RO to give me suggestions on new upgrades!

AAT-52: I also wanna have new equipment, Commander!

Commander: Don't look at me like that. If you want it, file an application!

Commander: If your requests are reasonable, I'll give it a think.

AAT-52: What?! Really?!

AAT-52: Then I'm gonna learn how to write a report right this instant!

Commander: Do your best. You could also ask STEN for some pointers.

...AAT-52 runs off, bubbling with excitement.

Commander: ...

Commander: So, why are you hiding behind the tree?

Commander: Still not used to your new gear?

STEN MkII: Uh... I'm alright...

STEN MkII: I'm just feeling a bit uncomfortable because of what AAT-52 just said...

Commander: Why should you be?

Commander: I had a chat with RO the other day. She did tell me to look forward to the result, but I certainly wasn't expecting this.

STEN MkII: Yeah, I kept the red beret.

STEN MkII: Commander...you aren't disappointed, are you...?

Commander: Quite the contrary.

Commander: When I moved you over to RO's squad, I didn't think you'd undergo such a drastic change.

Commander: Did something good happen?

STEN MkII: No, in fact...my luck was still rotten.

STEN MkII: But that's probably why Miss RO would give me a proposal for an upgrade.

STEN MkII: If I become stronger, I can stand by what is right with stronger conviction – that's what she said.

Commander: Ah, justice. Is that what she meant?

STEN MkII: Yes. In a way, she's quite like Miss Welrod.

STEN MkII: Though she did want to give me a more serious demeanor...

STEN MkII: But I thought it'd be a better idea to take this slowly.

Commander: It's wise that you've kept your friendly, girl-next-door appearance.

Commander: A sweet smile is a lot more effective than weapons when dealing with humans!

STEN MkII: You make it sound as if...Dolls that look like pushovers are more popular...

Commander: Can't be helped. Humans are that shallow.

Commander: What, disappointed in us?

STEN MkII: Not at all.

STEN MkII: I was terribly confused, but not anymore.

STEN MkII: That's right, an unyielding conscience is what points to justice...

STEN MkII: So long as we never turn our backs on this belief, we will never lose our way.

STEN MkII: And this...is how we will keep being the “shining beacon in a brave new world”.
