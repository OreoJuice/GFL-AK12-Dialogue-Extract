In the Griffin dormitory.

AR-15: Tomorrow will be our first official mission.

AR-15: I can't allow any mistakes on our first outing, so I'd better turn in early tonight.

An hour later.

AR-15: Dammit... I can't sleep after all...

AR-15: I'm only going to waste time lying here; I'd better go over the mission briefing again.

AR-15: M16 is sleeping well. A minor mission like this ought to be a piece of cake for someone as experienced as her.

AR-15: SOP-II's fast asleep. I guess having an empty head like hers is an advantage at a time like this...

AR-15: M4 should also be...

AR-15: Huh? She's not in bed?

AR-15: The door is slightly ajar... Where has she gone?

AR-15: So that's where you are.

M4A1: Eh!?

M4A1: Oh, it's you, AR-15...

M4A1: Weren't you asleep?

AR-15: ...I woke up to get some air.

AR-15: What about you, why aren't you in bed?

M4A1: I couldn't fall asleep...

M4A1: I felt restless while lying on my bed, so I thought I might as well do some planning.

M4A1: That way, at least we'll have a response ready if we encounter any contingencies tomorrow...

AR-15: Do you really need to do so much planning for a simple recon mission?

AR-15: We might not even get a chance to trade fire with the enemy.

M4A1: I'm the team leader, so it's only natural for me to plan about these things...

M4A1: Also, since this is our first mission together, I want to complete it flawlessly.

AR-15: If that's what you're really thinking, then I can be somewhat at ease.

M4A1: What do you mean by "at ease"?

AR-15: I was actually kind of worried about whether or not we could successfully complete this mission.

AR-15: After all, it was a miracle that we made it through our trials with a rookie like you giving orders.

M4A1: (Sighs) Is that so... The weight on my shoulders feels even heavier now.

M4A1: Oh yes, that also means...you can't sleep because of tomorrow's mission as well, right?

AR-15: ......

AR-15: ...I guess you could say that.

AR-15: I mean, how could I sleep peacefully when my team leader's on the verge of a mental breakdown over a recon mission?

M4A1: Haha...that means you're just like us, AR-15.

AR-15: I'm not exactly happy to hear you say that.

M4A1: I'm sorry...I wasn't referring to our abilities.

M4A1: You're serious and capable, and you're very strict with yourself...

M4A1: In truth, I was kind of afraid of you at first.

AR-15: So you're not scared of me anymore?

M4A1: Ah...well, not as much...

M4A1: At least I now know that you get nervous about upcoming missions, just like me.

M4A1: And that you can be so worried that you can't sleep...

M4A1: How shall I say this... It feels like...we're actually quite similar.

AR-15: Similar, huh...

AR-15: I admit, I do have my weaknesses.

AR-15: But we're warriors. We're weapons...

AR-15: There's only one thing we need to focus on, which is to devote every part of ourselves to achieving victory.

AR-15: Uneasiness and uncertainty are weaknesses that should be discarded...

AR-15: Especially in your case, M4A1... You're our leader, so it's even more important that you remain level-headed at all times.

M4A1: ...I've often felt that you might be better suited to be team leader than me, AR-15.

AR-15: But the humans chose you. Those are the orders.

AR-15: Since you're the team leader, you ought to take responsibility for it.

AR-15: All you need to do is focus on leadership and bring victory for us...for the members of the team.

M4A1: ...Thank you, AR-15.

M4A1: I won't disappoint you tomorrow.

AR-15: I believe you. I'm sure you wouldn't want to know what'll happen if you disappoint me.

M4A1: ...I'll keep that in mind.

M4A1: Also...it's really late now. Want to go back together and turn in?

AR-15: You're done with the contingency planning?

M4A1: Yes, I'm more than well prepared.

M4A1: ...We'll test the results of our training against the mission tomorrow.

AR-15: Alright.

AR-15 leaves.

M4A1: Goodnight, AR-15.

M4A1: ...I'll be counting on you tomorrow.

AR-15: ...

AR-15: That's...only to be expected.

AR-15: ...Ah, shut up already.

AR-15: You don't need to keep reminding me...

My body's in tatters.

My vision is murky, and I can't feel any pain.

I'm crawling on blind instinct toward a patch of faint light.

AR-15: I thought...everything would have ended just now.

AR-15: Damn you, Sangvis Ferri...

AR-15: What...a bad joke...

AR-15: M4 and the others should be safe now, right?

AR-15: M4...

M4A1: You're serious and capable, and you're very strict with yourself...

These are...

The events from that night...

M4A1: ...I've often felt that you might be better suited to be the team leader than me, AR-15.

Is that really the case?

I...

Having come to this point, I've proven myself to be even less worthy of the position than you...M4.

AR-15: We're warriors. We're weapons...

AR-15: There's only one thing we need to focus on, which is to devote every part of ourselves to achieving victory.

I want to do anything I attempt to the best of my ability...

I want to be acknowledged. I want to become a bright, shining star...but...

AR-15: But the humans chose you, M4. Those were our orders.

AR-15: I once thought that I wanted to change my fate...

AR-15: But instead, I came to understand that perhaps, in some ways, I could never compare to you...

AR-15: In being so serious... In being so persistent...

AR-15: Perhaps I'm afraid...

AR-15: Afraid that I've lost any worth I ever had...

[Warning] Less than 1% power remaining

AR-15: Is it...over at last...

AR-15: Am I going to...

...

Contemptible female voice: Huh, to think you actually crawled all the way here.

AR-15: ...Who's that?

Contemptible female voice: You look quite the mess, AR-15.

Contemptible female voice: Your parts are all over the place, and it took us a while to recover them all...

Contemptible female voice: You've always caused trouble for others...

AR-15: ...

Contemptible female voice: You've shut down already?

Contemptible female voice: Oh well, it can't be helped. I'll bring you back and then we'll talk.

...

I hate this voice beside me.

But I don't have the energy to talk back anymore.

I wonder what's going to happen to me...

I...

...

Sier: You're back, Miss UMP45. Did your mission go well?

UMP45: We achieved our objective, at least.

UMP45: You, on the other hand, don't look too good.

UMP45: Was she being that way again?

Sier: ...Yes.

UMP45: Forget it, you're not suited to deal with people like that. Let me handle it.

UMP45: It's been a while, AR-15. Here's a present for you.

AR-15: ...

UMP45: Or rather, it's a "present" that our employer has ordered you to install.

UMP45: If you want strength, then you'd best be quick about it.

AR-15: ...

UMP45: Isn't this what you always wanted? Yet you still insist on walking around with that chip on your shoulder.

UMP45: Griffin Dolls...really are delicate.

AR-15: ...I don't need anything from you.

UMP45: Don't think you're getting these for free, AR-15.

UMP45: We're losing out on our share of the profit because of you.

UMP45: Just take this mission for example, most of the pay went into that module you're holding.

AR-15: Well I'm terribly sorry about that.

AR-15: But I never asked you to save me.

UMP45: Do you think I WANTED to save you?

UMP45: Finding all your little bits and piecing you back together was really tiring, AR-15.

UMP45: We only went to all that effort because our employer thinks you're still useful.

AR-15: They want something of me?

UMP45: Sier didn't dare to say it so boldly, but I guess telling you up front is a sign of respect for you, right?

AR-15: Why me?

UMP45: You're kind of famous in Griffin.

UMP45: And among Dolls...fame often goes hand in hand with skill.

UMP45: I guess our employer likes that about you.

AR-15: Me? Famous? That's only because I was in the AR Team.

AR-15: And besides...I'm not the sort of Doll who can meekly follow orders.

AR-15: If you send me out on a mission, half the time it won't turn out the way you want.

UMP45: That is exactly what our employer wants.

AR-15: You keep going on and on about this "employer", do you even know how to do anything besides following orders?

UMP45: That's just my way of life. I have no choice in the matter.

UMP45: How about you? You wanted freedom, right? We can grant you your wish.

AR-15: Freedom?

AR-15: I don't even know anymore if I ever truly longed for freedom.

AR-15: Perhaps I simply enjoyed the feeling of disobeying orders.

UMP45: Give it a try, then. There's not much time left for you to sit idly by.

UMP45: If you don't go out and do something, you'll never find your answer.

AR-15: ...

UMP45: Hurry up and choose, AR-15.

UMP45: What can you accomplish just by staying here?

: UMP45 turns and leaves.

AR-15: The choice I should make...

AR-15: What I really want...

AR-15: Can I find the answer?

Angelia: It's time to set out.

Angelia: Are you ready, AR-15?

AR-15: ...Let's go.

Angelia: You look to be in good shape.

AR-15: ...Give me your orders.

AR-15: What do I need to do?

Angelia: You're pretty eager...

Angelia: Are you in such a hurry to pay your debt?

AR-15: Don't get me wrong.

AR-15: I want to verify certain things. And by working with you, I might get my answers.

AR-15: That's the only reason I'm taking your orders, Angelia.

Angelia: Then let's use each other until we achieve our own objectives.

Angelia: Welcome to Task Force DEFY, AR-15.

I have to act.

This isn't just for the people who are important to me...

But more importantly, to see where my worth lies.

And so, I'm starting out on a new journey.
