...

In a corner of the Griffin base.

MP-446: Hold it right there, P7! Get back here!

P7: Hehe, catch me if you can!

P7: Hey! Everyone! I learned Viking's big secret!

C96: Hm? What is it? Tell me, tell me!

M1919A4: Viking's secret? ...That sounds kind of fun.

MP-446: Waaahhhh! Don't listen! Don't say it!

P7: Hehe...

P7: I turned off the lights and closed the door to the storeroom while Viking was inside getting something...

P7: Then Viking started crying and banging on the door and said she was soooo scared! She was crying so loudly!

MP-446: I... I didn't! P7's just making things up!

C96: Huh? So you're scared of the dark, Viking? Are you a scaredy-cat?

M1919A4: Viking, you're sooooo lame!

M1919A4: What's so scary about a dark storeroom? It's exciting, isn't it?

P7: See, see? And you were talking about how you would be okay with any kind of mission just now~

P7: You can't do anything by yourself, how can someone like that take on a night op?!

MP-446: Humph...humph!

MP-446: I did that on purpose for you to see, P7...

MP-446: How could anyone go on a mission if they were afraid of the dark?

C96: Eh...so it was fake...

C96: But...

MP-446: That's right, it was fake, so don't ask about it!

P7: Hehehe... I got it.

P7: If you were really faking just now, why not prove it? 

MP-446: How...how do I do that?

P7: I know a place where we can test your courage. We'll go tonight, how about that?

P7: You won't refuse if you're really not scared, right?

MP-446: Um...er...

C96: Viking, you're not bluffing us, are you? Liars are worse than scaredy-cats.

M1919A4: It's not like you need to lie about being scared of the dark...

M1919A4: You should just say yes since it's fun, Viking.

MP-446: (Whimpers) F-fine, I'll go! What's there to be afraid of?!

P7: Hehehe...it's a deal, then.

P7: We'll meet here tonight then sneak out of the base together. You'd better come.

At night, in an abandoned town not far from the base.

C96: It's kind of cold... P7, are we there yet?

P7: We've arrived.

P7: Just in time to see what's inside!

MP-446: Where...is this place...?

...There is a thick, tightly-closed trapdoor in the underground tunnel beneath the town. The door is not labelled.

M1919A4: This door looks pretty cool! It feels like there's something fun behind it.

P7: I found it when everyone was searching this area earlier.

P7: However, I never had the time to open it and go in. Now we're just in time for Viking to show her stuff!

MP-446: Eh...me?!

P7: Yup. Just go in there, walk around a little, then come out and tell us what's inside.

P7: That should be simple if you're not afraid of the dark, right?

MP-446: I...but...that...

P7: Is it me, or is Viking shivering? She looks soooo scared!

MP-446: I'm not!

MP-446: It...it's just going inside! I'm not scared!

M1919A4: Hahahaha! That's more like it!

M1919A4: Come out quick, I want to know what's inside!

MP-446: Humph! Just you wait!

...Everyone combines their strength to push the heavy door open.

P7: The door's open, MP-446. We'll be waiting here for your return~

P7: You won't come running back halfway while crying, will you?

MP-446: As if that would happen...!

MP-446: If you don't believe me...then go ahead and close the door!

C96: Ohhhh! You're so cool, Viking! Frankly speaking, even I wouldn't dare to try that...

M1919A4: It'll be pitch black if you close the door...

M1919A4: Wow, just thinking about it gets me excited, I want to go in there too!

P7: While I didn't intend to do this at first...

P7: Since you've said so, let's close the door. Remember, you need to go all the way in.

P7: Good luck!

The heavy door closes from the outside...

...Leaving MP-446 inside, alone and by herself.

...

......

MP-446: ...Eeeep!

MP-446: What am I doing?!

MP-446: The light...where's the light...?

...MP-446 switches on her torch with trembling hands.

MP-446: I can't I can't I can't I can't ...I can't do this! I...I need to go back!

MP-446: ...

MP-446: ...But that damn P7's definitely going to be waiting for me to come back in tears!

MP-446: Damn you, P7! I won't fall for it! Just you watch! I'm not scared!

MP-446: (Whimpers) Why does this place go so deep...?

MP-446: How much further do I have to go before I reach the end...?

...MP-446 reaches the door at the end of the passage and pushes it open.

MP-446: Please let this be the last room...

MP-446: Huh? This is...

MP-446: Aaaaaahhh!

...The sprawling underground chamber is filled with many Dummy bodies.

It would seem she has arrived at a large warehouse.

MP-446: What the heck, that almost scared me to death. Turns out it's just a bunch of Doll Dummies...

MP-446: But there's so many here...it feels kind of creepy.

MP-446: Still, that's not enough to frighten me! There's nothing scary about a bunch of non-moving bodies!

MP-446 approaches one of the Dummies.

MP-446: Still, where did they come from...?

MP-446: Heehee, what if they're the same model as me?

MP-446: Hang on...

MP-446: This label...

MP-446: ...Ehhhhhhhhh?!

Upon close inspection of their manufacturing label, MP-446 jumps several steps back in alarm.

...The maker's mark, which is clearly printed on their bodies, reads—

—"Sangvis Ferri Manufacturing".
Part 2

...

Inside an underground chamber in an abandoned town near the base.

MP-446: Sangvis Ferri dummies?!

MP-446: Why...why are they here, and so many of them?!

MP-446: This is bad! This is really bad! I need to get back and tell everyone!

Calm Voice: The extent of the damage to the main door's smart lock was expected.

Calm Voice: But the strength of those Griffin Dolls...was not.

Forceful Voice: I just don't understand why you're so insistent on wiping them out. They're just a bunch of kids, aren't they?

MP-446: Huh...those voices are...

Scarecrow: If only you hadn't been so slow, we could have wiped them out before they found us.

Executioner: Attacking kids goes against my principles.

Executioner: Eliminating them did us no good, and it interfered with our mission.

Scarecrow: Our mission is to start up this backup Dummy storehouse, so obviously it would be best to play it safe.

Scarecrow: It would be troublesome if they managed to run back and report it to Griffin.

MP-446: Start...start up?!

MP-446: And everyone's already...?!

Executioner: Tsk, she sent us all this way to look for a backup warehouse that might not even exist...

Executioner: What made Intruder so confident that it was here...?

Scarecrow: Well, this used to be a Sangvis sub-plant, and the warehouse was sealed long ago.

Scarecrow: It was very likely that the items remaining here would be in good condition.

Executioner: But was there a need to go to such lengths for a bunch of old Dummies?

Scarecrow: In addition to the old Dummies, there are a lot of Goliath bombs further beneath that can still be used.

Scarecrow: Those Griffin Dolls...they'll probably scatter like rats once they see the Goliaths.

MP-446: If the S.F. Dolls are activated...then everyone at the base will be in danger...!

MP-446: ...Ugh...! What should I do...? How did things end up like this...?

Executioner: Humph, and if this surprise attack succeeds, won't Intruder steal the credit again?

Scarecrow: Enough complaining. It looks like the Dummies mothballed here are in good shape.

Scarecrow: Get to the control room. Once they're connected to the command network, it's no longer our business.

...Executioner's and Scarecrow's voices fade into the distance.

MP-446: (Whimpers) Don't tell me P7, C96 and M1919 are all...

MP-446: This is bad...but it's too late for me to run now... I need to stop S.F.!

MP-446: But...how did things end up like this...?

MP-446: If only there was someone else here... If only...

...MP-446 peers nervously at the Dummy body beside her.

MP-446: ...

MP-446: ...C96?

MP-446: Can I call you C96?

...MP-446 pulls off the Dummy's head.

MP-446: ...

MP-446: ......

MP-446: ...This is terrible! Listen to me, C96!

MP-446: S.F. just snuck in here, and if they activate the Dummies, the base will be in danger!

MP-446: ...That's right! We mustn't be scared of them! We've got to stop them!

...

MP-446: Those S.F. Dolls said that there were lots of Goliath bombs further below...

MP-446: Yeah, M1919, I know. If we can bring them up here and detonate them, we'll be able to destroy these Dummies!

MP-446: So we'll be able to find those bombs if we head further down...

MP-446: (Whimpers) It's so dark...

MP-446: How far down does this go...?

MP-446: No! I'm not scared!

MP-446: Good thing you're all here! I'm at ease as long as everyone's around!

MP-446: Quit laughing, C96, if you were here you'd pee your pants in fright too...er...no, wait, I mean, your skirt...er...hang on...

...MP-446 takes a while to think about C96's clothes.

MP-446: Forget it! In any case, let's carry on!

...MP-446 hugs the Dummy head.

Eventually, she reaches a door labelled "Caution! Mobile! Explosive!"

MP-446: "Explosive"... This must be it, right?

MP-446: I wasn't followed...so they probably didn't spot me...

MP-446 looks back anxiously into the darkness. She tries to listen for any sound, but she can only hear her own breathing.

Then, she pushes the door open.

MP-446: (Whimpers) If I'd known, I wouldn't have looked back, all it did was make me more worried...

MP-446: It's all your fault, C96! Er...why are there so many Goliaths here...? And they're all painted red, what's with that...

MP-446: Although, if I can get one upstairs...

MP-446: Even if I can't wreck all the Dummies, at least the base should hear the sound of the explosion...

Scarecrow: Your plan is so full of flaws I don't even know where to begin.

MP-446: Whoa!

MP-446: What-what are you doing here?!

Scarecrow: Since when were you under the impression that I had not found you?

Scarecrow: I really am quite curious. Oh well, it's not like it's that important. Nice to meet you. Now die.

MP-446: Aaaaaaahhhhh!

Scarecrow: ...Huh?

...Scarecrow reaches out to grab MP-446, but she is hit by the Dummy head that MP-446 throws at her.

MP-446 takes advantage of the opening to dive into the pile of Goliaths.

Scarecrow: ...

MP-446: How's that! Bet you don't dare open fire, do you!

MP-446: If you miss, this whole place will go "Boom!"

MP-446: So come on, shoot me! Shoot me! Come on!

Scarecrow: ...I can rip you to shreds with my bare hands.

MP-446: Come have a go if you're so tough!

MP-446: Watch this!

MP-446 picks up a Goliath beside her and throws it at Scarecrow.

At the same time, she hugs another one to herself.

Scarecrow: Hm... I anticipated this level of resistance. It's useless.

MP-446: As if I'm going to fight you! Dumbass!

MP-446: So long! Moron! Goodbye!

Still holding the red Goliath in her arms, MP-446 slips through a gap and runs past Scarecrow.

She runs into the jet-black passage again, toward the S.F. Dummy storage warehouse.
Part 3

...

Under an abandoned town near the base, in a Sangvis Dummy storage warehouse.

MP-446: (Pants)

Executioner: Is that it? Is this your plan?

...MP-446 stands in the middle of a warehouse full of Dummies, holding a Goliath bomb in her arms.

MP-446: So...so what if it is?!

MP-446: I'm going to stop your evil scheme!

Executioner: Huh...well, you should know what'll happen when that thing blows up.

Executioner: Although simply cutting you in two goes against my personal principles...

Executioner: I have a mission to carry out, so I can't leave you to wreak havoc behind my back.

MP-446: (Pants) Then come at me if you can!

MP-446: See if I won't blow you up with all these Dummies!

Executioner: Tsk...

Executioner: Tell me, why have you come alone to a place like this?

MP-446: What do you mean, "why"?

MP-446: We'll stop you if you're up to no good!

Executioner: That's not what I'm asking.

Executioner: Why did you abandon your friends at the door and run into a place like this by yourself?

MP-446: Because I'm not like what P7 said I was!

MP-446: I'm not the sort of person who needs to cling to others!

MP-446: I can get things done, even if I'm alone!

Executioner: ...

Executioner: Is that so...

Executioner: Alright, then. You've done very well.

Executioner: However, all your rashness has accomplished is cause trouble for your little friends.

Executioner: They will all die at the doorway to this place because you insist on doing this.

MP-446: Huh...?

Executioner: The Dummy activation program has almost finished uploading.

Executioner: I'll give you one last chance...

Executioner: Drop that thing and get out of here.

MP-446: I won't! I'll never do it!

MP-446: I won't let you activate these Dummies!

...Bang bang!

MP-446: I...

MP-446 collapses after being attacked from behind.

Scarecrow: Why waste your breath, Executioner?

Scarecrow: Isn't this much simpler?

Executioner: I told you before...

Executioner: Never mind.

MP-446: ...E-everyone...

Scarecrow: Huh, this brat's still conscious.

Scarecrow: We'll save a special seat for you to witness your foolishness.

S.F. Combat Dummy: IFF authentication program complete...connected to the operational network...

S.F. Combat Dummy: Welcome back, Commander.

MP-446: (Groans)

Executioner: Is that enough? Intruder must be overjoyed now.

Scarecrow: Well, if you know that, then why don't you run?

Scarecrow: After all, these things are still quite dangerous...

Goliath Bomb: ...

Goliath Bomb: ...IFF authentication program complete.

Scarecrow: Hm?

Scarecrow: Executioner, did you activate the Goliaths as well while you were on the server?

Executioner: What? Didn't you tell me not to do that for now?

MP-446: Heh...hehe...

Goliath Bomb: Threat identified, entering attack mode.

Goliath Bomb: Initiating detonation sequence.

Executioner: It's detected a threat? Is it the remains of this brat?

Executioner: What's this bomb talking about?

Scarecrow: It doesn't matter, that brat must have fiddled with it. We can't stop it now.

Scarecrow: Executioner, we'll get caught up in the blast too if we don't leave now.

Executioner: Then what about these Dummies?

Executioner: We can't just go back and report...

Scarecrow: We'll just say there was something wrong with those Goliaths.

Scarecrow: Let Intruder worry about the rest.

...The two high-ranking S.F. Dolls flee the warehouse with haste, leaving only the Goliath and MP-446 behind.

MP-446: ...Hey! P7...we did it...

MP-446: Did you hear that?

Goliath Bomb: Disabling safety device. Entering final countdown phase.

MP-446: P7, you...that's such a heartless reply...

MP-446: But at least this way... I've succeeded, right...

MP-446: Everyone...

...MP-446 feels someone lifting her body.

MP-446: Ugh...who's that...?

...A massive explosion roars out just as she makes it out of the underground room.

MP-446: (Grunts)... I'm saved...

MP-446: But...who...

M1919A4: Hey! What do you mean "who"?!

M1919A4: C96! Viking's neural cloud has been damaged, did you bring the quick repair kit?

C96: It's not like we came out here to fight! Why would I bring one along?!

MP-446: M1919...and C96?

MP-446: Weren't you...?

P7: You thought we were dead?

P7: Don't tell me you actually believed what S.F. was saying?

MP-446: P7...?

P7: You're too naive, Viking. Say no more.

P7: It was easy enough to deceive someone like Scarecrow with petty tricks.

P7: I think...it was about as hard as the games of hide and seek we usually play.

MP-446: But...why were you...

C96: We came back to look for you, of course!

C96: Actually, we were hiding behind those Dummies.

C96: I've never seen P7's face so pale before...ow!

P7: Quiet, you!

M1919A4: When we saw you running back with that bomb, we thought you were planning to let it go and run...

M1919A4: But we didn't expect you to stand up to Executioner and get in a shouting match with her, it scared us all to death.

M1919A4: That bomb even scanned us when it activated, that really was...

MP-446: ...So...that bomb exploded...because of you?

P7: Humph, it's your fault for only setting a timed detonation.

P7: If we weren't around, your plan would have failed!

P7: Hurry up and thank us!

C96: Huh, did you really call that bomb P7?

C96: It felt really weird hearing you talk to it all that time!

MP-446: Uh...that was just...

...The sound of a chopper comes from the distance.

P7: Ah...trouble's coming.

P7: After all... the base would surely have noticed an explosion like that.

M1919A4: What should we do...? Should we run?

M1919A4: At least we can take Viking with us...

P7: Forget it, we need to get her to the repair bay ASAP.

P7: As for the rest...we'll just have to believe in Viking.

MP-446: Huh...?

MP-446: P7...what are you doing?!

...In the Commander's office.

P7: That's how it is Commander.

P7: All this was thanks to Viking, who found suspicious traces which led to S.F. Dolls while conducting a patrol, even while she was being repaired and in pain...

P7: She even continued pursuing them, which was how she found out about something so important!

Commander: ...While I should inquire further into why exactly you went out by yourselves in the middle of the night, I guess I'll just have to let that slide for now given the circumstances.

Commander: As for Viking...MP-446... She did show her courage and responsibility.

Commander: It looks like I'll need to find an opportunity to commend her for it...so please help keep this under wraps, all of you.

C96: Yes, Commander!

M1919A4: Sure thing!

Commander: You've all worked hard tonight. Go get some rest.

...Everyone leaves the Commander's office.

C96: P7, did you describe the situation to Commander like that on purpose?

C96: Wasn't that a little too...

P7: Hehe...now I'm square with Viking, aren't I?
Part 4

    4chevron_right

...

In a corner of the Griffin base.

C96: Ah! Viking's come to show off again!

MP-446: Hehe, this is the reward the Commander specially presented to me!

MP-446: And Miss Kalina even ordered a new set of gear for me too!

C96: Miss Kalina was just looking for a chance to make you spend your reward money!

C96: You're too easily fooled!

MP-446: So what! At least she gave me a special discount!

MP-446: It was just enough to change out all my previous gear!

M1919A4: Ah...it's so nice...

M1919A4: I'm so jealous of your new gear...

MP-446: Hehe, after all, it took a lot of hard work to hang on in that dark and cold place.

MP-446: As of now, I've conquered the darkness!

P7: Oh? Really?

P7: How about...we go out again tonight?

P7: You were just lucky last time, you might still be a scaredy-cat!

MP-446: It's not that I don't want to go, but I don't want to put everyone in danger just so I can prove myself.

MP-446: If you really want a test of courage...how about the big storehouse?

MP-446: You can try anything you want.

P7: Tsk...it's not fun in our own base...

MP-446: It's a deal, then! After all, I can't cause trouble for other people just to satisfy my recklessness!

...

P7: Ehhh...she was so fun to toy with a few days ago, how did she suddenly end up as our leader...?

P7: Oh well.

P7: I suppose it's time for me to find someone new to mess with!
