Inside the new Griffin base.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wooooow—! RO!

M4 SOPMOD II: Look, it's waaaaaay bigger than the previous base!

RO635: How do you STILL have the energy to be so excited about all this?

RO635: Wait, wait, don't start jumping all of a sudden!

RO635: ...I'm going to fall off! SOP-II, you dummy!

M4 SOPMOD II: After all we've been through, this is like heaven!

M4 SOPMOD II: Aren't you happy, RO?

RO635: I'm not in the mood.

RO635: Right now, I just want to swap to a new body...

M4 SOPMOD II: Aw, don't worry, RO!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sure we'll be able to fix everything soon enough in this new base!

...Click.

...Communications link established.

M4 SOPMOD II: This signal is... Miss Kalina!

Kalin: Haha, you look pretty lively, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yup yup! RO and I are alright!

RO635: I'm not alright in the slightest!

Kalin: We're kind of busy now so I can't really chitchat...

Kalin: Miss Persica said she wants to see the two of you...

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica's on the base too?

M4 SOPMOD II: That's wonderful, RO! You'll be getting a new body soon!

RO635: Haha... I sure hope so...

Kalin: I'm sending you the coordinates to the dorm, SOP-II. You two should get some rest.

Kalin: Miss Persica's still making adjustments to the facilities. She'll send for you later.

M4 SOPMOD II: Got it! Thanks, Miss Kalin!

...The transmission ends.

SOP-II and RO proceed to the room that Kalin specified.

M4 SOPMOD II: This must be our new dorm room!

M4 SOPMOD II: It feels great! Seems to be about the same as before... No, it's a little bigger than our previous one!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhh, and this bed looks so comfy— Woohoo~

SOP-II dives onto the bed, and lies down comfortably hugging a pillow.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yup yup, the bed's softer than before too...

RO635: SOP-II! Tell me before you jump on the bed!

RO635: Ah! Ahhhh! Hurry and help me up — this bed's too soft!

M4 SOPMOD II: Pfhahahaha! No need to panic, I'll help you now!

SOP-II sits up and cradles RO into her arms.

M4 SOPMOD II: Our new dorm is great... If only the rest of the team were here with us too...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO... when will everyone come back?

M4 SOPMOD II: M16... M4...

RO635: We'll find them. Persica will fix you up soon enough, and I'll get a new body for myself too.

RO635: Once that's done, we'll look for them together.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yup, that's right! Hopefully Miss Persica will fix us soon. That way, we'll be able to find everyone sooner!

Half an hour later.

M4 SOPMOD II: Mmmm... Why hasn't anyone contacted us yet...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica's so sloooow...

RO635: It's only been half an hour.

RO635: Just be patient and wait. Why not use this time to clear out your cache?

M4 SOPMOD II: But I don't wanna keep lying around...

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh yeah, how about going outside for a walk?

RO635: Nah.

M4 SOPMOD II: C'mon, let's go familiarize ourselves with the layout of the new base.

M4 SOPMOD II: If we scout ahead, it'll be easier to find places to eat and play in the future!

RO635: How do you expect me to go out and meet people when I look like this?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Aw, don't worry! Everyone's busy, I'm sure nobody'll notice.

M4 SOPMOD II: Alright, it's settled! We're heading out now!

RO635: Hey! Don't go and decide that on your own!

RO635: Would you PLEASE listen to what others have to say, SOP-II—!

SOP-II brings RO to the main hall of the new base.

M4 SOPMOD II: In addition to the brand new dorms, there's a whole lot of new facilities that I don't recognize here!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hmm, those Dolls seem to be members of the HOCs. Maybe I go over and say hi...

RO635: ...Hurry up and go back.

M4 SOPMOD II: Aw, just a little more, RO. We'll go once I find the cafe!

RO635: Someone's coming, we've got to go...

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh? Are they dangerous?

M4 SOPMOD II: But I'm not picking up any weird signals...

Makarov: SOPMOD II of the AR Team... Looks like you're alright.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah, you're... Makarov!

Makarov: I'm glad you still remember my name.

Makarov: In that case, mind if I take up a bit of your time? There are some things I would like to ask you.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah...sure.

Makarov: Are you... the only one from your team to have made it back?

M4 SOPMOD II: Er, well...

Makarov: I just wanted to check with you if RO was safe.

Makarov: A few people outside of your team... are worried about her too.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, I understand...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Come on, RO, say something!)

RO635: ...

Makarov: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Makarov cares a lot about RO too; I can't let her leave in disappointment...)

M4 SOPMOD II: (How should I say this...)

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, well... she...

Makarov: What happened to her?

M4 SOPMOD II: RO... RO's been badly hurt, so Miss Persica's fixing her up right now!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah, but her neural cloud is fine! I'll put her in touch with you once her body's fixed!

Makarov: ...Is that so?

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm telling the truth!

M4 SOPMOD II: I personally ripped... I mean, I personally brought her neural cloud back!

Makarov stares at SOP-II and raises an eyebrow.

Makarov: ...I understand... Well, as long as she's fine.

Makarov: Spasibo, SOPMOD II. I will relay the news to the others.

Makarov: By the way, your new trophy looks very unique.

Makarov left.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, are you alright? C'mon, say something!

RO635: ...What good would that do? It's not like you'd listen to me anyway.

M4 SOPMOD II: Phew... I was scared for a moment back there. I thought you broken down or something...

RO635: If only I could scare your neural cloud into being more mature...

RO635: Still... why didn't you tell Makarov the truth just now?

M4 SOPMOD II: But I DID tell her the truth!

RO635: I mean, about me being in this Dinergate.

M4 SOPMOD II: Well...

M4 SOPMOD II: I just thought that... you'd be really mad if I'd told her, right?

RO635: Yes, I really don't want to show up like this in front of the others, especially Makarov.

RO635: I guess... your neural cloud must have grown a little if you managed to understand that.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahaha... really?

M4 SOPMOD II: Doesn't feel that way to me.

M4 SOPMOD II: We went through so much to get back to safety, so all I wanted was to cheer you up a little, RO...

RO635: It's not often that I praise you, so you should just leave it at that.

RO635: Let's go to the cafe next, and then hurry back to the dorm...

M4 SOPMOD II: Alright! The adventure continues~

...Click.

...Communications link established.

Persica: SOP-II, RO, it's been a while since we last met.

M4 SOPMOD II: M-Miss Persica!

Persica: Your adventure's going to have to wait for a while, SOPMOD II.

Persica: Come to my lab now, and be quick about it.

Persica: If we're lucky, we should be able to settle your problems before dinner.

M4 SOPMOD II: Roger! We're heading over now!

...End of transmission.

RO635: So I can leave this body at last, huh...

M4 SOPMOD II: Just hang on a little bit longer, RO!

M4 SOPMOD II: We'll be back to normal soon!
Part 2

SOP-II and RO arrive at Persica's lab.

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica — we're here!

Persica: Well, that was fast. I thought I'd have enough time to finish my coffee...

Persica: Eh... SOP-II, are you alone? Where's RO?

M4 SOPMOD II: RO came too! Here she is!

SOP-II holds up her Dinergate in front of Persica.

Persica: What? Is she really inside that Dinergate?

Persica: I thought Kalina was joking, I even kicked her out of my lab...

RO635: As much as I hate to admit it...

RO635: My neural cloud now resides within this contraption, Miss Persica.

Persica: While that's hardly surprising in itself... the fact that it was SOP-II who did this...

Persica: If this had happened in the past, I'm pretty sure you would have simply handed me a destroyed neural cloud with drained battery.

M4 SOPMOD II: What do you take me for?! There'd be no point in giving you a broken core, would there?!

Persica: Not necessarily. However, what I'd like to know is... how did you do it?

M4 SOPMOD II: I... I'm not too sure myself. Back then, the only thing on my mind was to save RO, so I did everything I could think of.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then... things ended up like this.

Persica: Hm... I expected an answer like that, but further investigation might prove very interesting...

Persica: What you did exceeded my expectations, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh! I'm the kind of T-Doll that makes miracles happen when it counts!

RO635: Miss Persica... before that, could you hurry up and get me out of this Dinergate?

Persica: I'm sorry, RO, but I don't have any suitable Doll bodies for you right now, so you wouldn't be able to do anything even if I got you out of there.

Persica: Why don't you stay in there for a while? After all, your current condition is pretty stable...

RO635: W-what?! But I can't stand this body anymore! I don't care if I end up as a normal Doll, just get me out of here!

Persica: My... you can't just move things around like they were Legos.

Persica: You two were lucky this time. Who knows what would happen if we tried another forced transfer?

RO635: It doesn't matter! I don't want to spend another moment in this stupid body!

RO635: Please, Miss Persica! Anything would be better than remaining in this Dinergate!

Persica: Hmm...there IS a place where I could put you for a while.

Persica: But you might run into a bit of trouble there...

RO635: That's fine! It can't possibly be worse than my current situation!

Persica: Alright then, I'll take care of that for you.

Persica: As for you, SOP-II... I need to deal with your jigsaw puzzle of a body.

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, I'm pretty much alright, although this arm moves by itself from time to time... Could you help RO first, Miss Persica?

Persica: I'll need to give you both a checkup before I take care of RO. Sit down here, you two.

Persica: While I'm preparing, tell me about what the two of you have been through.

M4 SOPMOD II: Okay! It's a very long story, though...

SOP-II takes the seat that Persica gestured at with RO on her lap.

Persica starts working.

...Half an hour later.

Persica: I see. Sounds like quite a thrill.

Persica: (Mutters) I do hope she'll be safe...

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica, are you worried about someone?

Persica: Ah, it's nothing. Let's sort out you two first.

Persica: SOP-II, what do you make of the recent operation?

M4 SOPMOD II: Here's what I think - I hope we never have to go through anything like that ever again!

RO635: Agreed...

Persica: ...Let me put it another way - what have you learned?

Persica: After all that fighting... have you come to a new understanding about yourself or others?

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, about that...

SOP-II lowers her head.

M4 SOPMOD II: In the past, all that mattered to me was having fun... I only realized how hard it was to be the one in charge only after I went through all that.

M4 SOPMOD II: M4 and RO are amazing... They can lead everyone to victory and bring everyone back from the battlefield in one piece, but I could never do that...

RO635: SOP-II...

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't want to lose my friends anymore. I don't want to be the only one left behind either... I don't want to be the sole survivor.

M4 SOPMOD II: I want to make myself useful to others... I want to ensure everyone's safety, so that all my friends can live on happily!

Persica: ...I understand.

Persica smiles warmly.

Persica: That was a good answer. Here's a little treat for you.

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm getting a treat, too?

M4 SOPMOD II: I thought you were just going to fix me...

Persica: Correct. I'm going to upgrade every aspect of your neural cloud and your weaponry.

Persica: You can look forward to your new-found power now, SOPMOD II.

SOP-II: What... IS this place?

SOP-II looks around the empty space.

RO635: We're inside a certain large database.

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh? RO, you're back to normal?

M4 SOPMOD II: No, wait... Am I on Level II now?

RO635: Yup. Miss Persica just dumped us in here.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh, I remember now.

RO635: For some reason I have a bad feeling about this place...

...Incoming transmission.

Persica: Looks like the two of you have successfully connected to my neural cloud database.

M4 SOPMOD II: What are we going to do next, Miss Persica?

Persica: RO's going to wait here for her new body.

Persica: SOP-II can go back once the separation is complete.

RO635: Tsk... So now I don't have a body at all, huh... Forget it, it's still better than being in the Dinergate...

Persica: You'll be parting soon, so best say your goodbyes while you can.

Persica: The separation program will activate in 5 minutes. You won't be able to see each other for a while after that.

RO635: A while... How long will that be?

Persica: That depends on how long the two of you can hold out.

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh? What do you mean...?

???: I sensed something so I came over to take a look. I didn't expect it to be you two.

RO635: What...? You, you're...

Ouroboros: Maggots of the AR Team...

Ouroboros: I've missed you.

Architect: Hi~ Don't forget me, I'm here too!

RO635: Hey! What's going on?!

M4 SOPMOD II: What are these Sangvis dorks doing here?!

Persica: Griffin transferred their neutral clouds to me in order to put them to better use.

Persica: Play nice, you all~

RO635: Eh? Hang on, is this some kind of joke?!

Ouroboros: Humph... Well, it won't be a problem if it's just you.

Ouroboros: Let me shred your neural cloud, RO635!

M4 SOPMOD II: I won't let you bully RO!

M4 SOPMOD II: You're the ones who're going to get shredded!

Persica: Nobody's going to be shredding anyone. That would cause trouble for me.

Persica: Alright, SOP-II, time to say goodbye to RO.

M4 SOPMOD II: But these two Sangvis...

Persica: It'll be fine, they can't do much inside my database.

Persica: Besides, don't you have faith in RO's skills?

RO635: What does this have to do with skills?!

RO635: Hey! Persica! Are you going to leave just like that?!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO...

Persica: Even if you don't believe in RO, you should believe in me.

Persica: RO will be perfectly safe here. I guarantee it.

M4 SOPMOD II: Al... alright, then.

M4 SOPMOD II: If you say so, Miss Persica...

RO635: Eh? What? Wait! Don't! Don't leave me alone, you two!

Ouroboros: Now die, Griffin scum!

Ouroboros: C'mon, you too, Architect!

Architect: Huh? Eh... fine, fine. We won't lose this time since it's two on one, right?

RO635: Come... come back, SOP-II!

RO635: At least help me take care of them first...

RO635: Ahhhh! Stay away from me you Sangvis bastards—!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll be heading off for now, RO! I'll come back to check in on you after my body's fixed!

...

【System】 ...Database connection terminated.

【System】 ...Returning to Level I.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO... seems to be having a hard time...

Persica: Is this really the time to be worried about someone else?

Persica wheels out a trolley with all kinds of machinery and gadgets on it.

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica... these things look kind of dangerous, don't they?

Persica: Now, without further ado, let's get started!

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica...

M4 SOPMOD II: You're really going to upgrade me and not scrap me, right?

Persica: Well, in order to upgrade you, I must first take you apart.

Persica: Don't worry, I've taken the necessary steps so this won't hurt. Trust me~

A dangerous smile spreads across Persica's face.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Whimpers) That face isn't assuring at all...

M4 SOPMOD II: Miss Persica's scarier than the Military right now...

M4 SOPMOD II: (Sighs) What's going to become of me after this...?
Part 4

【System】 ...Connecting.

【System】 ...Database connection established.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO? RO, are you there?

RO635: SOP-II?

RO635: ...What are you doing here?

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, I came to see you, of course!

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, this place is huge, so I can't find you...

RO635: So you just barged into the database without any idea of what you're doing?

M4 SOPMOD II: I was in a hurry to find you, RO...

M4 SOPMOD II: My neural upgrade is complete! I want you to be the first to see!

RO635: Jeez... Alright.

RO635: Hold on a bit, I'll guide you to my current sector...

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Why am I in the dorm?

RO635: Well, I was bored and I had no idea how long I'd be spending here, so I decided to remodel the surroundings.

RO635: Besides, there's lots of space here, so Persica probably won't mind.

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't believe you could do all this... You're amazing, RO!

RO635: Humph, I can do a lot more than this.

RO635: Didn't you say you were upgraded? You don't look very different than before, though? Also...

M4 SOPMOD II: Ah, well...

M4 SOPMOD II: I like the way I looked before, so I asked Persica to make as few changes to my appearance as possible.

RO635: But you didn't need to keep that Dinergate either, did you?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, seeing it reminds me of the time I spent with you and the others...

M4 SOPMOD II: So I asked Persica to turn it into a piece of supporting accessory and kept it with me!

M4 SOPMOD II: Plus, it's very cute, isn't it?

SOP-II holds up her modified Dinergate in front of RO.

RO watches the Dinergate's stubby legs flail helplessly in the air, and sighs in resignation.

RO635: Eh, whatever. Besides, it's not like I hate it now...

RO635: You know, upgrades don't come by often. You could have asked Persica for so much more.

RO635: You're so headstrong but gullible at the same time...

M4 SOPMOD II: But I HAVE become stronger! Besides, no matter how I'm upgraded, I have to stay me. Otherwise it's just getting more powerful for its own sake, and there's no point in that!

RO635: Is that so...?

...RO falls into a thoughtful silence.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO?

RO635: It's nothing. Just mulling over your uncharacteristically wise words.

M4 SOPMOD II: What?! This remodel should have made me smarter too!

RO635: I can't tell. Maybe all it did was give you more ways to torture your enemies?

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, well, I do feel more inspired.

RO635: Eh, that's good...

RO635: I want to get out of this place and go outside too. I wonder what kind of body Persica's got waiting for me...

M4 SOPMOD II: I heard from Persica that a team is already hard at work on it!

M4 SOPMOD II: She also said that you'd definitely be very happy with it when it's ready.

RO635: Happy? I sure hope so. I have no idea what Persica has in mind...

M4 SOPMOD II: By the way, RO... Are you alone here?

RO635: Yes, why do you ask?

M4 SOPMOD II: If I remember correctly... there were two Sangvis Ringleaders with you when Persica put you in here, right?

RO635: Oh, you mean Ouroboros and Architect?

RO635: They were too much of a nuisance, so I took care of them.

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh?! You destroyed them?

RO635: Why do you look so shocked? This is my home turf.

RO635: Also, I didn't destroy them. Persica must be keeping them around for a reason.

RO635: Right now... they're probably banging their heads against a wall in a dark corner somewhere.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wow... For some reason I feel like RO has a scary side too...

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't worry. You've always been nice to me, so I won't lock you up in a dark room.

M4 SOPMOD II: Okay, that's a relief!!

M4 SOPMOD II: Right, I gotta go, RO! I need to go see the Commander about a new assignment!

RO635: Hold on! Remember to tell Persica to work faster! Make sure she doesn't forget about my new body!

M4 SOPMOD II: Got it! I'll keep nagging her to work!

RO635: Also, don't forget Makarov and the others! Tell them I'll be back!

M4 SOPMOD II: I~ got~ it~! I'll tell them too!

...The farther away SOP-II goes, the softer RO's voice becomes.

RO635: One more thing, SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh—?

RO635: Will you really be okay by yourself—?!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm not alone—!

SOP shouts back at the top of her voice and raises her Dinergate in her hands, giving it a shake for emphasis.

RO635: What — are — you — doing?! I — can't — see—!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'll — be — fine —! I — still — have — everyone — with — me —! Don't — worry —!

RO shouts something else, but SOP-II can't make it out. Still...it doesn't matter anymore.

...

【System】 ...Database connection terminated.

【System】 ...Returning to Level I.

M4 SOPMOD II: Now then... time to see the Commander! And meet all the new friends I've made!

...SOP-II leaves the room and heads outside. The Griffin base is filled with busy T-Dolls running here and there.

Cx4 Storm: SOP-II! Is that you?

M4 SOPMOD II: Cx4! We meet again, what a coincidence!

Cx4 Storm: Yup! But... you look a little different from before, don't you?

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right! My previous body was too old, so I had it replaced. How do you like it? Do I look good?

Cx4 Storm: Yup! You look even cooler than before!

Cx4 Storm: Actually... I wanted to thank you, SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? You've already thanked me enough.

Cx4 Storm: Not at all. I thanked you back for saving me.

Cx4 Storm: But this time, I want to thank you because you gave me hope.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hope?

Cx4 Storm: I had no idea what I was capable of, and I spent my days mindlessly following orders at G&K...

Cx4 Storm: But when you arrived, you showed me that there were a lot of things I could do!

Cx4 Storm: Thank you for bringing me on an adventure, SOP-II. I can always do my best from now on even on my own!

MP40: Cx4 Storm, hurry up! The logistics mission is about to start!

Cx4 Storm: Ah, sorry, I'm rambling too much. Well, that's how it is. See you next time, SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: Yup, we'll meet again! Do your best!

...Cx4 Storm waves at SOP-II before rushing off. SOP-II watches her as she leaves for a good long time.

M4 SOPMOD II: I should be the one thanking you...

M4 SOPMOD II: If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't know I could do so much for everyone.

M4 SOPMOD II: And the more I can do, the more courageous I become in the face of obstacles...

SOP-II pats the Dinergate on her shoulder, and steps into the flow of traffic moving through the base.

Just you wait, everyone. I'll find a place for myself at G&K all over again...

And then...

M4, AR-15, M16...

I'll bring you all home — I promise!
