...

AK-47: ...This is Corsac Fox. Nothing to report in Zone B.

SKS: This is Bullseye. Nothing to report. The target is not in Zone C.

AK-47: Tiss?

OTs-12: Sorry for the delay. No sign of the target in Zone A either.

SKS: Are you sure the target is in the factory?

AK-47: All the other locations have been cleared. She's got to be here, there's no mistake.

Grasping her weapon, AK-47 huddles close to stacks of containers and slowly walks ahead as she explores.

SKS: Do we really have to be so careful? Isn't there only one of them?

AK-47: Hush... Don't be ridiculous, Bullseye.

Apart from the sound of dripping water, all is silent.

AK-47 is on high alert as she scans every nook and cranny conscientiously.

SKS: ...Tiss?

Just then, SKS's puzzled voice comes through her earpiece.

Ba-dump.

An ominous feeling spreads through AK-47. She can almost hear her non-existent heart pumping in her chest.

SKS: We've lost contact with Tiss! I'm going to find her!

AK-47: Something feels off... Crap, this is a trap!

AK-47: Bullseye, get out of there at once!

Bangbangbangbangbang!!!

All of a sudden, a series of gunshots erupt through the comms line. AK-47 immediately tears out the earpiece.

AK-47: Freaking hell!

She can't afford to sneak around anymore! The enemy is operating alone!

She has to reach the target while SKS and OTs-12 are slowing her down!

Thunk!

AK-47: !

However, AK-47 has barely run several meters when she suddenly hears a loud noise. Then both the gunshots and the commotion cease.

AK-47: ...Bullseye? Tiss?

Naturally, no answer comes through the comms. AK-47 racks the bolt on her rifle.

AK-47: Don't panic... There's still a chance. There is still...

???: —

Thunk!

...

A somber-looking middle-aged man strides down the corridor in a hurry. When he arrives at the entrance of the workshop, he looks up at the camera on the door.

???: Security clearance check. Tier A. Serial number 00541.

???: Sasha Jarvis.

???: Vice-Chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, PIC and Liaison of the Wolf Pack Project.

???: Welcome, Mr. Jarvis.

Jarvis: Thank you, Nadia.

"Nadia": You are welcome.

As the door opens, a strong odor of tobacco mixed with the smell of machine oil and dust wafts out, making Jarvis frown.

???: (Exhales)

Through the thick cigarette smoke, a person dressed in a white lab coat can be seen standing in the center of the room. She appears to be the source of all this smoke.

Even sailors from the last century wouldn't have smoked tobacco of such poor quality, but she has to resort to such crude materials just to clear her own head.

Jarvis: Doctor Samantha Sh—

???: Shut up.

After cutting Jarvis off irritably, the woman with dark circles around her eyes opens her eyes with obvious displeasure.

She plucks the cigarette away from her lips and blows out another whiff of tar-filled smoke.

???: You stepped on my chessboard.

???: And you interrupted my train of thought.

Jarvis: Chessboard?

Jarvis looks down at his feet. He finds nothing other than a pile of nuts of varying sizes and a haphazardly placed spanner.

Jarvis: Where?

???: Here.

The woman points at her own temple impatiently. She glares at Jarvis and places the half-smoked cigarette between her lips again.

???: ...Take three steps forward.

Jarvis blinks. Then with a helpless chuckle, he obliges and takes three steps forward.

???: Two steps to the right.

Jarvis: ...Hm, well?

???: Checkmate.

After putting out her cigarette, the woman dusts her hands off and sits down on her chair.

???: What do you want?

Jarvis: Comrade Zelinsky wishes to congratulate you, Doctor Samantha Shaw.

Jarvis: The latest test has been yet another great success.

Shaw: ...Of course it was, it's not worth making a fuss over.

Shaw: Also, just call me Shaw. All those unnecessary syllables just make my head hurt.

Not impressed by the good news brought by Jarvis, the woman swivels in her chair and taps away on her keyboard.

Shaw: It took her such a long time to handle those garbage ex-civilian Dolls from IOP. She still has a ways to go.

Jarvis: The results are already quite extraordinary at this stage.

Shaw: Spare me the nonsense. I hate it when people beat around the bush.

Rubbing her temple, the doctor rises from her chair. At her full height, she is as tall as Jarvis, though right now she looks a little haggard.

AN-94: ...Reporting for duty.

Jarvis: Oh, if it isn't the star herself.

An exquisite Doll enters the room through the door. She looks rather haughty, though she dials it down in Shaw and Jarvis' presence.

AN-94: Good afternoon, Mr. Jarvis.

AN-94: Good afternoon, Doctor Shaw.

Shaw: Just skip the pleasantries... You did well in your training.

Shaw: I gathered some pretty useful data.

AN-94: You flatter me. It was just a routine session.

AN-94: Are my opponents in the previous match the best T-Dolls IOP has to offer?

Jarvis: Well, they may not be the best, but they certainly have a lot of combat experience.

Jarvis: Their leader, AK-47, in particular, has worked with our forces in the past, and her performance was very commendable.

AN-94: But even so, she was no match for me.

AN-94: I would hardly call someone of that caliber an "elite".

Jarvis: Hahaha... Your tongue is still as sharp as ever.

Jarvis: Still, it's good that things are going well. I'll be taking my leave then, Doctor Shaw.

AN-94: One moment please, Mr. Jarvis.

Jarvis: Hm?

Jarvis is just about to leave when AN-94 calls out to him. A little confused, he turns around to face her, then looks over to Shaw.

Shaw: ...What is it?

Clearly, AN-94's behavior has also taken Shaw by surprise. She eyes the Doll silently and quirks an eyebrow.

AN-94: ...May I ask when I will go on active duty?

Jarvis: Well...

Jarvis seems shocked by AN-94's question. Instead of giving an answer, he looks toward Shaw.

Shaw: That's for us to decide.

Shaw: Robots shouldn't ask too many questions.

AN-94: But... Sorry, it's been a long time since I was created.

Shaw: You don't qualify yet.

AN-94: I outperform those Griffin Dolls in every way.

AN-94: Even they can go on missions with Statesec, while I'm only allowed on the training ground.

AN-94: I want to know why.

Shaw: Why? Because I say so.

Shaw: Now get out and stop badgering me.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: ...I understand. I will continue my training until you deem me ready.

AN-94 falls silent. Her face is unreadable.

She peers at Shaw, who looks adamant. She bows slightly and leaves the room.

...

AN-94: (Sighs)

"Nadia": You sound pretty miffed, 94.

AN-94: ...Nadia?

AN-94: No, I'm not miffed. Just a bit defeated.

AN-94: I thought I did an excellent job, but Doctor Shaw expects an awful lot from me.

"Nadia": I have served Doctor Shaw for a long time, and she has always held everything to a very high standard.

"Nadia": Especially since you are the very first Doll she's created, she has extraordinarily high hopes for you in many regards.

AN-94: I know, I am Unit 1, so I must have something to show for it.

...At the very least, she must show some improvement before her next successor is rolled out.

AN-94: Nadia, could you pull up the report from my last training exercise?

"Nadia": The report is as follows.

"Nadia": "Wolf Pack Project" Experiment Log 10032, Location – Field No. 3

"Nadia": Opponents – Griffin Squad formed of three T-Dolls and 15 Statesec Special Forces.

"Nadia": Result – All targets subdued in 11 minutes 24 seconds.

AN-94: ...What could I have done better?

"Nadia": Apologies, I am an AI for scientific research. I am incapable of detailed tactical analysis.

"Nadia": But I do believe this was a very outstanding result for you.

AN-94: Then why? Why can't I go on any actual missions?

AN-94: The Griffin Dolls that lost to me today are all so much weaker than me, yet they have already accumulated a great deal of field experience.

AN-94: So why am I not given the same opportunity?

"Nadia": I'm deeply sorry, but I don't have the answer to that question.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: ...Never mind. There's no point in being angry with you.

AN-94: Doctor Shaw must have a reason for this decision... I am a member of the Wolf Pack.

AN-94: Of course I shouldn't compare myself with ordinary Griffin Dolls.

"Nadia": ...I'm glad to see you've cheered up.

AN-94: I will keep training. No matter how many times it takes, no matter how many enemies I must defeat.

AN-94: I will not back down so easily until I've earned Doctor Shaw's recognition. Don't worry, Nadia.

After a brief pause at the door, AN-94 shakes off her restlessness and puts on a brave smile. Then she turns around and heads off to the training ground.
Part 2

2

Statesec Training Ground, Neo-Soviet Union.

Bangbangbang!

AN-94: ...

The gunshots cease, and AN-94 lowers her weapon.

"Nadia": Accuracy – 92.16%.

"Nadia": Congratulations, AN-94, you have shown even more improvement.

Her test result has improved yet again since last time.

She once thought a Doll's performance was decided from the moment they're rolled out, but now, she can see the difference that training has made.

AN-94: So this is what Doctor Shaw wanted me to figure out... Now I understand completely.

Nadia's statistics has lifted AN-94's spirits. She stretches her arms and put down her weapon.

AK-47: Oh? If it isn't AN-94! So you're here today as well.

AK-47: You still train very diligently even though you're an elite Doll.

AN-94: The efficacy of training isn't measured by the day.

AN-94: I'm plenty strong, but that's only in comparison with you.

AN-94: I'm still a long way off from measuring up to Doctor Shaw's standards.

AK-47: ...Oof, that stings.

AK-47: We also train very hard, you know, but we're often busy with missions.

AK-47: Unlike you, we can't hang around on the training ground all day.

AN-94: ...

AN-94 does not know what to say to that. She picks up her gun again and loads another magazine.

AK-47 obviously doesn't mean to be hurtful either... She doesn't know why AN-94 still hasn't been deployed.

AN-94: Our specifications are different from yours. We won't be deployed unless it is absolutely necessary.

AN-94: Besides, our creator is a perfectionist who won't let us go on missions until she is completely satisfied with our performance.

AK-47: Really?

AK-47: But your little sister did a pretty good job.

Bang!

"Nadia": Shot missed.

AN-94: ...What did you say?

AK-47: W-what's wrong?

AK-47 doesn't know what she said to have provoked such a strong reaction from AN-94. She backs away a little uncomfortably.

AN-94: What did you just say? What little sister?

AK-47: You don't know about AK-15?

AK-47 stares at AN-94 in shock.

AN-94: ...I do, of course I know about her.

AN-94: You're referring to Unit 2 of the Wolf Pack Project, White Mastiff, who is to be Imprinted with the assault rifle AK-15, right?

AN-94: Now that you mention it, it IS about time she got rolled out. I've been at the training ground all this time, I've clearly forgotten about that.

AK-47: Yeah, I think she was completed the day before yesterday.

AK-47: You're sisters but you didn't even know? Man, that's cold.

AN-94: We are Tactical Dolls. We hold no such sisterly ties, so please don't refer to us as such.

AN-94: Not to mention, I haven't been notified of her completion—but that's not the point. I want to know what you meant by what you just said.

AK-47: What did I say?

AN-94: You said AK-15 did a pretty good job. What did you mean by that?

AK-47: You haven't heard about that either? We just came back from a mission with her.

AK-47: She is an absolute beast like you. She took on all those terrorists single-handedly.

AK-47: She was practically a tank on legs.

AN-94: ...

...How could this be?

The day before yesterday? AK-15 was only rolled out two days ago, so she just had her first performance evaluation, right?

How come she was sent on a counter-terrorist mission on the very next day?

AN-94: Then what's the point of me... Nadia?

"Nadia": Yes? How may I be of assistance?

AN-94: Did you know about this?

"Nadia": If you are enquiring about Mission File No.206202170016...

"Nadia": I cannot divulge any information outside of the laboratory as it pertains to confidential matters under the Wolf Pack Project.

AN-94: So this mission really did take place?

AN-94: —WHY?!

AK-47: Wait—hey, calm down! Why are you shouting all of a sudden?

AN-94: Get out of my way, AK-47!

AK-47: Hold... What's your problem?!

...

AN-94: Nadia, why didn't you tell me?!

AN-94 questions the accompanying AI angrily as she dashes down the corridor.

"Nadia": You never asked me about the daily schedule.

"Nadia": I don't know which item you are referring to.

AN-94: Don't play dumb! I'm obviously talking about AK-15!

AN-94 abruptly comes to a stop.

The corridor is completely deserted. Other than the AI that's embedded in the computer system of the entire facility, nothing else can be heard.

AN-94: ...I've always thought Doctor Shaw had her own considerations.

AN-94: As the very first unit of the project, I must set a good example, and I trust Doctor Shaw's decisions and judgment.

AN-94: That's why I've spent the last few months on the training ground telling myself that I wasn't ready, that I still didn't meet her standards.

AN-94: But Unit 2 took part in a counter-terrorism mission the day after she came out of the factory!

AN-94: How am I supposed to accept that?! I haven't even met AK-15!

"Nadia": ...

"Nadia": ...I have no answer to this question.

AN-94: Then I'll have to ask Doctor Shaw herself.

"Nadia": I do not recommend this course of action.

"Nadia": AN-94, you may not receive a satisfactory answer.

AN-94 ignores Nadia's warning and continues on her way.

AN-94: Doctor Shaw!!

AK-15: ...

Being overcome with emotion, AN-94 uncharacteristically throws open the door to Shaw's office without even a greeting.

She marches into the office with the intention to confront Shaw, but the moment she comes through the door, everything she wants to say is lodged in the back of her throat.

She stands transfixed as she meets the gaze of a stranger.

AK-15: ...The prototype.

Studying AN-94, the towering Doll mutters in recognition. All hostility instantly vanishes as she retracts her predator's gaze.

But AN-94 remains rooted to the spot. She gawks motionlessly at the statuesque Doll standing in the center of the office.

???: AN-94, I presume?

Just then, an unfamiliar voice jogs AN-94 out of her shock.

Angelia: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Angelia—the future commander of the Wolf Pack. Tentatively speaking.

Shaw: Shut up.

Shaw sits down on the sofa and puts out her cigarette impatiently.

It's plain to see that she doesn't want AN-94 here right now.

Angelia: I'm introducing myself to my future subordinate. You're the one who should shut up.

Angelia: You may be their creators, but I'll be the one in charge of them. Don't get the wrong idea here.

Shaw: It's AK-15 and AK-12 that I'm handing over to you, not her.

Shaw: She's just the prototype.

AN-94: ...What does that mean?

AN-94 looks at Shaw.

AN-94: She... AK-15, right? She also said the same thing just now.

AN-94: Am I not Unit 1 of the Wolf Pack Project? What do you mean by "prototype"?

Angelia: ...Shaw?

Shaw: It's her misunderstanding. I have no obligation to explain myself to a Doll.

AN-94: Misunderstanding?

A seed of doubt and dread burgeons in AN-94 and starts growing rapidly.

AK-15: I am Unit 1, AN-94.

AK-15: You are the prototype. If you're to be given a number, it would be 0.

AK-15 answers AN-94's question quietly.

AN-94: ...What's the meaning of this?

AN-94 clenches her fists, trying to suppress her anger.

AK-15's brow furrows in confusion at the question.

AK-15: Which part of my answer did you not understand?

AK-15 means no offense with her query.

Her face is completely calm and devoid of emotion.

Her crimson eyes are cold... just like the way she views the world.

Angelia: I think you DO need to explain it properly.

Shaw: To whom?

Shaw ruffles her own hair in exasperation.

Shaw: What's the point in telling her?

Angelia: No matter what your plans are for her...

Angelia: She has a right to know the truth.

Shaw: Ha, so even Dolls have rights now.

The two women starts arguing back and forth right in front of AN-94.

Already anxious to begin with, AN-94 can no longer remain silent.

AN-94: ...I came to ask you something, Doctor Shaw.

AN-94: It is more important than the prototype matter.

AN-94: I want to know why AK-15 is deployed on missions while I'm not.

Shaw: ...I don't have time for your nonsense.

Angelia: You're full of nonsense yourself. Just solve the problem if you don't want to waste time.

As if stung by Ange's words, Shaw clicks her tongue in annoyance and produces another cigarette from her pocket.

Shaw: ...Because you're a prototype, AN-94.

AN-94: So what exactly does that mean?

Shaw: It means, I never intended for you to go on missions.

Shaw: You're just a unit for collecting data in experiments, not for actual combat. Do you understand now?

AN-94 stares at Shaw in disbelief.

AN-94: I'm... an experimental subject, a tool for you to gather data?

Shaw: Scientific research is a process of trial and error.

AN-94: So I'm an "error"?!

AN-94 screams furiously.

AK-15: ...

Stunned by her outburst, AK-15 does an almost imperceptible double take. She gazes at AN-94.

Angelia: ...Calm down, AN-94.

Angelia: And you, Shaw, can't you say something nice for once?

Shaw: I never thought I'd ever get a lecture on "speaking kindly" from you of all people.

AN-94: ...I'm sorry.

Realizing that her reaction was a bit overboard, AN-94 reins in her anger and apologizes to Shaw glumly.

AN-94: But I cannot accept your decision.

Shaw: ...You're not getting this right.

Shaw: My decisions aren't for you to second-guess.

AN-94: ...

Shaw: I've given you the answer you wanted.

Shaw: Now get out and stand by. Don't make me say that again.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: ...Understood.

AN-94 looks like she still has more to say, but under Shaw's stern gaze, she gives up in the end.

She takes a deep, shuddering breath, and after one final glance at AK-15, she leaves the office.

Angelia: ...

Watching AN-94's receding figure, Ange drums her fingers lightly on the table.

She has a feeling...

...that this isn't over yet.
Part 3

In a corridor in Statesec HQ, Neo-Soviet Union.

AK-15: ...

AK-15's dull footsteps echo through the empty corridor.

...She has just completed her training for the day and is on her way back to the dormitories.

AK-15: ...

Just then, she comes to a stop.

AK-15: ...Is something the matter, AN-94?

She turns her head and looks behind her.

A Doll much shorter than her but no less striking strides out from the shadows.

AN-94: ...

AK-15: You've been following me since I left Doctor Shaw's office.

AK-15: If there's anything you'd like to say, just say it.

AN-94: Let's have a duel, AK-15.

AK-15: Pardon?

AN-94: I want a duel with you.

AK-15: ...I don't understand.

AK-15: What is the point of that?

AN-94: Doctor Shaw never lets anyone question her decisions.

AN-94: Unless they can prove that she's mistaken.

AN-94: Whether I'm Unit 1 or Unit 0, I don't care.

AN-94: But I must prove that I'm better than you, AK-15.

AN-94: I'm not some experimental unit left to rot in the factory. I am the forerunner of the Wolf Pack.

AK-15: I still don't understand. If that's the case...

AK-15: Your action is even more pointless, AN-94.

AK-15 turns around and faces AN-94.

AK-15: My performance is superior to yours in every way.

AK-15: You cannot win against me.

AN-94: ...How will we know without trying?

AN-94: I really hate the way you look at everything so indifferently.

AN-94: Can't you even be bothered to look me in the eye?

AK-15: ...

AK-15 is silent for a while.

AK-15: ...Alright.

AK-15: As you wish...

AK-15: Prototype.

AN-94: Much obliged.

...

AN-94: Hm?!

Shaw: ...

AN-94's eyes snap open as she awakens abruptly. She jumps right out of the repair tank.

Shaw is sitting on a chair with her back to her, breaking open a cigarette and scattering the tobacco on the table.

Shaw: Run a self-diagnostics to see if anything's wrong with your neural cloud, little nutter.

AN-94: D-Doctor Shaw?

AN-94: ...Why are you calling me that?

AN-94: Wait, where's AK-15?

Shaw: ...

Shaw swivels around on her chair and stares at AN-94 in silence.

She's looking at her with a strange expression—she seems angry, but there's something more.

What just happened? As AN-94 recalls, she was on the training ground with AK-15...

AN-94: Ugh...!

Shaw: How dare you do that behind my back.

Ba-dump.

Shaw: ...Anna was right.

Shaw: I've made you too human.

AN-94: (Groans)

She remembers now.

Effortlessly, like a grown-up teasing a child, like a mastiff hunting a hare...

She was defeated... unequivocally, as expected.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 is superior in every way.

Be it performance, tactics, or skills.

She simply cannot hold a candle to this insurmountable mountain of a Doll.

To AN-94, this is an unprecedented experience. She has always won. She has always been victorious. This is the first time she has experienced crushing defeat.

...She cannot accept it.

AN-94: I'll never, ever—

AK-15: —!

The last thing she remembers doing was lunging at AK-15 like a lunatic.

It wasn't even a duel at that point. All she wanted was to beat AK-15, because if she didn't do that, she would never recover from the defeat.

However...

AN-94: Ugh...

AN-94: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!

Shaw: ...Tsk.

Shaw: Nadia, deactivate her!

"Nadia": Yes, madam.

She remembers it all.

She suffered a one-sided beatdown against AK-15, but she refused to give up.

In the end, AK-15 disabled her completely, and she was taken to the repair workshop.

"Nadia": Wild fluctuations detected in AN-94's neural cloud.

"Nadia": It is inadvisable to assign her any tasks for the time being. More lenient management is recommended.

Shaw: ...Right.

Shaw tosses her cigarette butt into the garbage can and picks up the postcard lying on her desk.

Angelia: I told you so.

Shaw: Get off it. You're the last person who can say that.

Angelia: Is it so difficult to admit that you made a mistake?

Shaw: What mistake? My only mistake was making her too human.

Ange walks around Shaw's desk and sits down across her quietly. She studies the chessboard lying on the surface.

Shaw eyes the notation written on the postcard morosely and moves a white piece.

Angelia: She is a Doll.

Shaw: As well as a weapon.

Shaw: Which makes her, quite simply, a weapon.

Angelia: T-Dolls are not just weapons.

Angelia: She is far more human than you think.

Shaw: Tell me, Nadia, are you human?

"Nadia": I do not comprehend your question, Doctor Shaw.

"Nadia": According to official information, humans, also known as homo sapiens, are the only surviving species within the genus of Homo.

"Nadia": A human is, first and foremost, a member of the kingdom of Animalia.

"Nadia": Since I am an artificial intelligence, I cannot be classified as a human.

Shaw: You heard her.

Angelia: You know that's not what I mean.

Ange watches the chessboard.

Now fiddling with a black piece, Shaw ponders how to counter white's previous move.

She is playing against someone far, far away. He is the investor of the Wolf Pack Project as well as a friend of Shaw's.

Angelia: A Doll's neural cloud has infinite potential. It is more than just programs and data that you wrote and compiled.

Angelia: Whether you acknowledge that or not, the fact is you've created AN-94, so why are you destroying her by your own hand?

Angelia: ...Persica would never do that.

"Nadia": Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

"Nadia": There are also certain fields where Doctor Shaw's expertise far surpasses Doctor Persica's.

Angelia: I'm talking to your master, Nadia.

Shaw: You're interrupting my thoughts.

Angelia: Shaw.

Shaw: Anna.

Shaw squeezes the chess piece in her hand. Her voice grows steely.

Shaw: I've never taught you how to use a gun, have I?

Angelia: If I ever start behaving like a stubborn idiot like you, feel free to tell me.

Shaw: Stop making unsolicited comments about my work.

Angelia: Dolls and weapons are two totally different things.

Angelia: If you want to succeed, you must let go of your prejudice.

Shaw: Prejudice?

Shaw snickers as she moves the black queen.

Nadia records her move quietly and prints the notation onto an empty postcard with a robotic arm.

Shaw: Would a Doll made according to your philosophy be able to defeat AK-15?

Angelia: ...

Shaw: AK-15 is the most ideal and perfect T-Doll—she doesn't question her orders, and she is practically a one-man army.

Shaw: Right now, she is definitely the most powerful T-Doll in the Neo-Soviet Union, no doubt about it.

Angelia: ...If you truly believe that...

Angelia: Why did you make 94 so much like a human?

Angelia: So much like...

Shaw: ...

Angelia: That's because you never intended for her to head onto the battlefield, isn't that right?

Angelia: That's terribly selfish of you, and you're hurting her with your selfishness.

Shaw: I don't know what you're talking about.

Angelia: In any case, I'm sure you don't actually hate 94 as much you pretend to. I'd stake my life on it.

Shaw: Whatever you say. I don't have the energy to argue with you.

Shaw: Can we change the subject now?

Angelia looks at Shaw and lets out a long, exasperated sigh.

She finds it unbelievable that there's someone in the world who's even more hard-headed than herself.

Angelia: I read your proposal on improving the Assault Artillery. You really are second to none when it comes to creating weapons.

Angelia: But you're creating Dolls right now... and there's a lot more to Dolls than simple weapons. AK-15 is indeed very powerful.

Angelia: But she also comes with a fatal flaw. You just haven't noticed it yet.

Shaw: A flaw that you see, but I don't?

Shaw snorts.

Angelia: That Wolf Eye System is pretty useful, but it's stifling AK-15's ability to learn and grow.

Angelia: She makes a brilliant soldier, but without flexible thinking, she won't be an effective leader.

Shaw: Would you let your gun order you around?

Angelia: You're letting Nadia help you with your research, aren't you?

Angelia: Can't you create a Doll that can both fight and lead?

Shaw: Trying to goad me into doing it? You think that'd work?

Shaw narrows her eyes dangerously, as if she's about to do something to Ange.

However, Ange only returns her gaze and crosses her legs the other way round.

Angelia: Yep.

Shaw: Ha! You're right, it always works.

Shaw: I'll make you eat your words... There's no need for another high-performance weapon anyway. AK-15 alone will do.

Shaw: I'll give AK-12 some additional features.

Shaw takes the postcard offered by Nadia's robotic arm and stamps her own seal on it.

Angelia: Persica is giving a lecture.

Angelia: I suggest you have a listen and broaden your mind.

Shaw: Screw off.

Shaw dismisses this ridiculous suggestion without hesitation.

A few days later...

Statesec Lab, Neo-Soviet Union.

AN-94: ...

Dragging her battered body, AN-94 slowly sits down before a one-way mirror. She gazes at the half-assembled Doll lying on the other side of the glass with hollow eyes.

"Nadia": You challenged AK-15 to another duel.

A light flickers in the empty room as a familiar voice offers her some company.

AN-94: ...Nadia?

AN-94: So you're still here.

"Nadia": I'm in charge of the security of Doctor Shaw's lab.

"Nadia": Besides, I'm just an AI. I'm always on duty as long as the power supply is running.

"Nadia": So I saw everything that had happened on the training ground.

AN-94: ...

"Nadia": The first time you fought AK-15, both your body and neural cloud experienced an unprecedented breakdown.

"Nadia": You are putting yourself in excessive danger with your actions. I advise against further duels.

AN-94: Nadia, am I weak?

"Nadia": You are without a doubt one of the strongest T-Dolls in existence.

AN-94: I once believed I represented a long-awaited new generation of Dolls in Statesec.

AN-94: I thought I was special. A powerful soldier destined to shoulder extraordinary responsibility.

"Nadia": ...Well, you are indeed very special.

AN-94: But I'm weak.

AN-94: Maybe not objectively speaking, but no matter how many times I take on AK-15, the result is always the same.

AN-94: I'm pathetically weak, Nadia.

AN-94: Doctor Shaw is right. She doesn't need me for no reason other than because I'm weak.

"Nadia": ...AK-15 is an exception among exceptions.

"Nadia": Even Doctor Shaw herself may not be able to produce another Doll that powerful.

AN-94: What about her?

AN-94 points to the slumbering T-Doll on the other side of the glass.

AN-94: ...How do you explain her?

"Nadia": "Snow Wolf" is only half-complete. It's too early to tell what kind of Doll she'll be at this stage.

AN-94: Stop lying to me, Nadia.

AN-94: I found out about what the Wolf Pack Project is all about.

AN-94: Right from the start, only two Dolls were planned—White Mastiff, the direct combat specialist, and Snow Wolf, the commander and strategist.

AN-94: They are the Wolf Pack. They are destined to work together and blaze a trail into the future for Statesec. As for me... I'm just a simple puppet.

AN-94 puts her hand against the glass and stares at the Doll in the workshop.

...Who exactly is she? What was the purpose of her creation?

If AK-15 is a weapon, then she... is just a useless gun.

AN-94: Griffin Dolls may be weak, but they're still needed; they still have a place where they belong.

AN-94: But I... I was born in the lab, and I will never get to leave the lab.

AN-94: My creator has no use for me, and neither does anyone else.

"Nadia": ...

AN-94: If I can't win against AK-15... Doctor Shaw will never spare me even a glance.

AN-94: I thought I was important, but in truth, I'm useful to no one.

AN-94: Nadia, I have no "value".

"Nadia": 94...

AN-94: They... THEY are the Dolls that Doctor Shaw, Statesec, and the world need.

Looking at Snow Wolf through the window, AN-94 lowers her head bitterly.

AN-94: I am, quite simply, superfluous...

Even Nadia doesn't know what to say to that.

AN-94 clenches her fists and curls up into a ball on the floor.

Her shoulders shake lightly.

AN-94: I'm... superfluous.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: AK-15's existence made me realize that.

AN-94: There's nothing special about me. I am not the least bit valuable.

AN-94: Neither Shaw nor Statesec expected anything of me.

AN-94: Nobody is counting on me. Nobody needs me. I don't have to do anything.

AN-94: ...Can I even say that I'm alive?

AN-94: ...

AN-94: ...The truth is too much for me to bear.

AN-94: If I'm not needed... If I have no value, then what is my purpose?

...
Part 4

...

SKS: (Sighs) Why is my score even lower than last time?

OTs-12: The moving targets create great variables, so fluctuations in your performance are only natural.

OTs-12: It takes more than just a few days to see tangible improvement.

SKS: But there must be some trick to this.

OTs-12: As if it'd be so sim—

AN-94: ...Your firing posture is too stiff.

AN-94: This is a common problem for civilian Dolls with a newly installed fire-control core.

AN-94: Relying too much on data hinders your ability to make full use of your body.

SKS: A... AN-94?!

A voice suddenly interrupts the Dolls' conversation, making both of them jump.

AN-94: You don't have to be so loud. I can hear you just fine.

OTs-12: Uh, no, sorry. She's just a bit surprised.

OTs-12: You've never talked to us before.

AN-94: ...Tiss, I've been meaning to tell you since our last training session.

AN-94: When you were operating on your own, you were too engrossed in your surroundings. You wanted to keep an eye on every direction.

AN-94: Your attention ended up being stretched too thin, and your distraction was easy to exploit.

AN-94: If you don't want to get taken out like that again, you'll have to get rid of that habit.

OTs-12: ...I see.

AK-47: ...

AN-94: ...What is it, AK-47?

AK-47: Nothing, it's just a little unexpected.

AK-47: You're suddenly being so nice to us. What's gotten into you?

AN-94: It's just a small favor. Giving you such feedback won't bring you much closer to my level.

AN-94: ...Besides, it'd make me feel better if I can be of some help.

AK-47: Feel better?

AN-94: ...It's nothing.

AN-94: It's just that I now understand how it feels to be defeated.

SKS: Defeated? You? Really?

SKS's face is the very image of shock.

AN-94: ...There will always be someone better than you.

AK-47: ...Are you talking about AK-15? You've been training with her for a while.

OTs-12: I see. Well, then it isn't so surprising...

OTs-12: AK-15 and AK-12... Hm, from what I know, they're both insanely powerful.

SKS: Are they really that big of a deal...? But powerful as they may be, they still botched a mission, didn't they?

AN-94: ...What?

AN-94 does a double take at that.

SKS: You haven't heard? They went on a mission together and ended up getting the target they were meant to protect—

AK-12: Now, now, let's stop right there. How about letting us sisters have a private conversation?

AK-47: —?!

AK-47: AK-12?!

Someone abruptly interrupts the discussion. This Doll with closed eyes and a smile who has just entered the training ground is none other than AK-12, the key member of the Wolf Pack.

AK-12: A word, AN-94?

Unlike AK-15, this Doll who has just strolled up casually to her isn't of extraordinary stature, nor does she seem particularly intimidating.

But the moment AN-94 first sets eyes on her, she can instinctively tell that there is something dangerous about her.

...

AK-12: Your results are much better than your records suggest, 94.

AN-94: ...I've been training regularly.

AN-94: Still, I am nowhere near as good as AK-15.

AK-12: ...

AN-94 turns around and puts away her weapon, then she starts tidying up the slightly messy desk behind her.

...Now that AK-47 and the others have left, AN-94 is alone on the training ground with AK-12, who still hasn't explained why she wanted to talk.

AN-94 speculates about AK-12's intentions as she organizes the ammo stores—accumulated spent casings, low-quality cartridges, blanks... She sorted them all out and stacked up all the ammo boxes tidily.

AK-12: You're a far cry from what's written in the records, AN-94.

AK-12: Your neural cloud has clearly undergone changes that Shaw didn't see coming. That's no easy feat.

AN-94: Doctor Shaw didn't see this coming because she doesn't care about me.

AN-94: I don't think these changes are anything remarkable anyway. I just feel like I should be doing a little more.

AK-12: Why is that?

AN-94: ...Because I have no purpose.

AN-94: If I don't do something, I can't justify my own existence.

AK-12: Hahahahahahahahaha.

AK-12 bursts into a peal of shrill laughter at AN-94's reply.

AN-94: ...Was that funny?

AK-12: Wasn't it? I thought you were breaking the ice with humor.

AN-94: ...Are you trying to pick a fight?

AK-12: No way. I just wanted to see if you're really the sort who'd take jibes lying down.

AN-94: ...

After cleaning the weapon she has been practicing with and returning it to its original storage place, AN-94 looks up and stares at the wall in front of her.

She doesn't want to turn around and look at AK-12... This Doll's very existence is a proclamation that "AN-94 is trash".

AN-94: So... what business do you have with a useless Doll like me?

AK-12: AK-15 and I separated.

AN-94: ...What?

AN-94 turns around dubiously and stares at AK-12, who looks decidedly flippant.

AN-94: That's no laughing matter.

AK-12: I'm not joking. AK-15 and I aren't compatible at all. Our differences are so great it put our mission in jeopardy.

AK-12: So I've decided to ditch her.

AN-94 gazes at AK-12, dumbfounded.

She's been immensely tormented because of AK-15's greatness, yet here stands AK-12, casually telling her that she's ditched AK-15.

And what she doesn't understand is...

AN-94: ...What does this have to do with me?

Sitting on the bench with her chin resting in a hand, AK-12 studies AN-94 with great interest.

Her usually closed eyes are now open. The faint glow characteristic of the Wolf Eye sends a jolt down AN-94's spine, making her flinch a little.

AK-12: You just said you had no purpose, yeah?

AK-12: Well, here's your chance, 94—I need a partner.

She holds out a hand to AN-94.

AK-12: I need you.

...

The Wolf Pack Project is an elite T-Doll research and development scheme initiated by the Bureau of State Security of the Neo-Soviet Union and led by the renowned military tech specialist Samantha Shaw.

Only two ultra high-spec elite T-Dolls were planned for the project, their designations being AK-15 and AK-12.

This two-Doll team was to be deployed on a variety of high-risk and critical missions under the command of Anna Viktorovna Tsoi.

...That was the original plan.

...

In an underground passage inside a submarine base.

The dull clanking above ground can be heard faintly even from so far below ground level.

AN-94 follows silently behind her teammate and commander and carefully cleans up their tracks.

AK-12: You do know that we can't handle that Sinner with just the two of us, right?

Angelia: Of course I do.

Angelia: I can't attest to the aesthetics of Shaw's creations, but they are definitely the most effective in the Neo-Soviet Union.

AN-94: But it's just a matter of time for Yegor to make his way down here.

Angelia: Luckily for us, our backup will join us before he can get here.

Angelia: We'll still have time to discuss strategies.

AK-12: Let me put it more plainly, Ange.

AK-12: Do you know what we'd need in order to take down the Sinner?

AK-12: A team that can pin it down in direct combat and three or more highly skilled blasters.

AK-12: The key would be the one leading the assault. I could do that, but what can you do about the very specific things that we don't have?

AK-12: Even two more T-Doll squads would be useless against that kind of monstrous mech.

AN-94: ...I can pin it down.

AK-12: No, it's too dangerous for you, 94.

AK-12: That's not something that a Doll can handle alone.

AN-94: Right...

Angelia: If 94 can't do it, what about AK-15?

AK-12: ...Who?

AN-94: —?!

AN-94's hands twitch as she looks up in shock.

Angelia: Your former partner, THE AK-15.

AN-94: AK-15... is here?

Angelia: Yep, together with RPK-16, so there's your blaster.

Ange turns around and looks at her two subordinates.

Angelia: With them in the equation, what are our chances of winning?

AK-12: They jumped from 0% to 1%—rejoice, Ange.

Angelia: ...So it went from "utterly impossible" to "worth a try", eh?

AK-12: I envy your optimism.

AK-12: But it's true. So long as that gorilla stays on her feet, we'll stand a chance of bringing down the Sinner.

AN-94: But... is AK-15 back on the frontline already?

Angelia: Thanks to AK-12, I don't know much about what she's been up to in the last two years.

Angelia: But I hear that she gets along swell with RPK, unlike with a certain someone.

AN-94: ...

Angelia: They'll be here any minute, so get ready.

AN-94: ...Right.

AN-94: AK-15 isn't one to skim on ammo, so she'll need some spares.

AN-94: I'll see if I can find any in the ammo dump we passed by earlier.

With a shake of her head, AN-94 turns and leaves hastily.

AK-12: ...

Angelia: I'll go and scout out the terrain.

Angelia: Start coming up with a battle plan.

AK-12: Alright, you're the boss.

Inside the ammunition depot, AN-94 gathers all the 7.62mm cartridges she managed to find.

AN-94: There are still some explosives here...

AN-94: They could come in useful later...

...AK-15 is coming.

AN-94 stops what she's doing and stands rooted to the spot.

The thought buzzes inside her head incessantly.

AN-94: That's great...

It is certainly a huge relief.

Powerful support is coming their way in this hour of desperation and despair, bringing them a sliver of hope.

As Ange has said, AK-15's arrival makes their plan worth a try.

AN-94: ...

But...

AK-15... was AK-12's original partner.

They went their separate ways because of irreconcilable differences, but that was a long time ago.

If AK-15 is willing to put aside her disagreements with AK-12, then... will AK-12...

AN-94: Does 12... need a stronger partner after all...?

...What she cannot do, AK-15 can.

In the end, she is still just a substitute.

Turns out the one who claimed to need AN-94 is still going to—

AK-12: AN-94.

AN-94: 1-12? W-why are you here?!

AK-12: If we're to bring down the Sinner, ammo alone won't do.

AK-12: We'll need a large amount of explosives, so I've come to take a look... You've already gathered them?

AK-12: I really shouldn't be surprised. You're always so thoughtful and attentive.

AN-94: Yes... I thought we might have use for them.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 takes in AN-94's awkward unease and walks up to her with a smile.

AK-12: I've never considered you a substitute for anyone.

AK-12: It's my problem that I don't gel with the gorilla, but you're a fantastic partner.

AN-94: ...!

AN-94: I... How do you...

AK-12: How long have we been partners now?

AN-94: ...It has almost been two years since Shaw disappeared.

AK-12 pats AN-94 on the back warmly.

AK-12: You don't have to keep thinking about how to beat her. It's stupid to compare muscles with a gorilla like that.

AK-12: You are you. You are AN-94, and you have your own strengths.

AK-12: You must be yourself, and not another AK-15.

AN-94: Strengths? ...Do I have any?

AK-12: AK-15 wouldn't have thought to gather the explosives even she spent a whole day in here.

AN-94: ...

AK-12: My partner will only be you, AN-94. You are you.

AK-12 says cheerfully as she makes for the door.

AK-12: They're almost here so Ange asked me to go collect them. Get everything ready and go back to her...

AK-12: Partner. ♪

AN-94: ...

AN-94: Got it.

...

AK-12's plan is absolutely insane.

Even with AK-15's exceptional strength on their side, the chances of success are still extremely minimal.

In other words... the challenge they're facing this time is incredibly difficult.

RPK-16: What's on your mind, 94?

AN-94: Huh...?!

AN-94: Oh... Nothing, I'm just familiarizing myself with the plan.

RPK-16: Yeah, AK-12 is asking for the impossible, isn't she?

RPK-16: Even if we pull it off, we'll most probably still be wiped out.

AN-94: That would already be quite ideal.

AN-94: I'm worried that we won't even succeed. Right now, we're about to face...

...An enemy even more powerful than AK-15.

AN-94 looks at AK-12, who is standing with her back towards her, and clenches her fists.

RPK-16: ...I've been snarking AK-12 the whole time, but I've got to admit that this is the only feasible solution.

RPK-16: Besides, the deciding factor of our success or failure isn't actually AK-15.

AN-94: What?

RPK-16: 15's job is just to pin the Sinner down.

RPK-16: It doesn't matter if she can last five seconds or ten, the result will still be the same.

RPK-16: The key to taking out the Sinner for good... is you.

AN-94: Me...?

RPK-16: In AK-12's eyes, you're better than AK-15... More outstanding than AK-15, even.

RPK-16: Before the moment of truth, you must protect AK-12, our chief assaulter.

RPK-16: Whether she can deliver the killing blow... depends entirely on how much strength you can help her preserve.

AN-94: ...

RPK-16: She trusts you a great deal, 94.

AN-94: 12...

RPK-16: Oh, by the way, before we set off, let me look upon your face one last time.

AN-94: ...?

RPK-16: Hm, now I'm brimming with motivation.

RPK-16: Let's do our best together.

AK-12: The target is within visual range.

AN-94: ...Understood.

AN-94: Ready for the assault.

Looking at AK-12's back, AN-94 exhales slowly and walks up to her side.

...RPK-16 was right.

She shouldn't get hung up... on how to be AK-15. For both AK-15 and AK-12, she should focus on being AN-94.

There are things that AK-15 can do, just as there are things that AN-94 can do.

She isn't anyone else... She is AN-94.

...

...

AN-94: (Exhales)

AN-94 comes out of her meditation and raises her head.

...That's not enough.

AK-15: What's not enough?

AN-94: 15? ...What's that you're holding?

AK-15: An explosive rivet—a part of a Stasi anti-armor weapon.

AK-15: The launcher is a write-off, leaving only the ammo, but it can still be useful.

AN-94: ...

AK-15: What were you talking about that's not enough?

AN-94: ...Did I say that out loud?

AK-15: Yes.

AN-94 closes her eyes. In the darkness behind her eyelids, she can almost see the awe-inspiring back again.

AK-12 has dragged her out of the abyss and given her salvation. She told her, "You are needed."

AK-12 is undoubtedly a light that has shone upon her... And now it is her turn to repay her.

As AK-12 has been telling her all along—she is AN-94.

AN-94: ...It's not enough that I just walk out from your shadow, AK-15.

AK-15: ...

AN-94: The challenge we're facing right now is even more trying than what we went through in the submarine base.

AN-94: If we are to overcome it, we must each do our part to the best of our ability.

AN-94: I will no longer ask myself, "What would AK-15 or AK-12 do?"

AN-94: ...Instead, I'll ask, "What can AN-94 do at a time like this?"

AK-15: ...The Commander is summoning us.

AN-94: ...Let's go.

AN-94 slowly rises and picks up her weapon. She turns and looks through the door.

...This time, she will be standing at the forefront, in the lead.
