XM3: I've had enough of you, M1918! How can you be so useless?

XM3: How can you call yourself a Tactical Doll after turning in a performance like that?

Super SASS: Miss XM3, that's going too far. Miss M1918 is our team leader, you know!

M1918: It's alright. Super SASS. Let her speak.

XM3: "Let her speak."? Do you even know where your problems lie, Leader?

XM3: How did you even become our team leader when you're so careless about missions?

XM3: Is it because you've been around a long time? What use is your experience, anyway?

M1918: ...

XM3: Hmph... Nothing to say?

XM3: That means we can't even get through to each other on a basic level, doesn't it?

XM3: M1918, your job is to finish the mission, is that so hard to do?

Super SASS: That's enough, Miss XM3... We completed our mission without a hitch, isn't that good enough?

XM3: Without a hitch? You call what happened just now "completing the mission without a hitch"?

XM3: We messed up every step of the plan, there was no chain of command, and it was every Doll for herself out there!

XM3: The only reason we're here to point fingers at each other is because the opposition was even more worthless than we were!

Super SASS: But... at least...

XM3: Tell me, Super SASS. Who's responsible for what happened just now?

XM3: Why aren't you angry?

M1918: XM3, don't talk to Super SASS like that.

XM3: I'm not against dying for the mission, but what I hate more than anything is pointless effort, M1918.

XM3: If you want to continue slacking off, then go right ahead, but I hope you're not standing by my side, and I sure as hell hope you aren't my team leader!

...XM3 storms out of the room and slams the door shut behind her.

Super SASS: I'm sorry about this, Leader...

Super SASS: I'll try and talk to XM3 afterwards...

M1918: You don't need to apologize, really.

M1918: These things...they happen. It'll be fine once it blows over.

M1918: And perhaps... she has a point.

...In the dorms.

M1918: Why am I their leader...? Why?

M1918: I'm clearly outdated, and I'm just an old dog that can't learn new tricks...

M1918: Why won't they let me live in peace...

...Someone knocks on the dorm door.

M1918: Please come in.

Five-seven: Bonjour, Miss M1918.

Five-seven: I didn't see you on the range today, and someone said you would be here.

M1918: (Sighs) What's this about?

Five-seven: I've heard some... rumors, so I went out of my way to express my concern for a friend. Is that so strange?

M1918: Our team can handle our own affairs. We don't need the FN Team to look in on us.

M1918: Besides... I doubt you're enough of a do-gooder to come all this way for such a small thing, are you?

Five-seven: My, my. Alright then, I'll cut to the chase.

Five-seven: To put it simply, the deep reconnaissance teams have recovered some reliable information from the S.F. servers. It seems like they're going to be making some big movements.

M1918: Shouldn't the Commander be handling this sort of thing?

Five-seven: You are correct.

Five-seven: However, the team members suffered a vicious attack when recovering this information, which shows the S.F.'s attitude towards the matter.

Five-seven: Therefore, it is up to us to take the initiative and launch the first strike. The Commander hopes that this will reduce the variables in play.

M1918: So why not ask some other Doll to do it? I'm not suitable for these high-difficulty missions anymore.

M1918: Each of the newcomers is more focused on the mission than the last, completely unlike me.

Five-seven: We aren't lacking for people to go on the mission.

Five-seven: This is the location for our attack...

...Five-seven points at the electronic map.

Five-seven: Does this remind you of anything?

M1918: Ah...

M1918: Nothing but bad memories... Has S.F. brought this base back online?

Five-seven: Miss M1918, you're the one who knows that place best among all of us.

Five-seven: Many of us weren't even in Griffin when you first went to that place.

M1918: A lot of Dolls quit after we captured that location... which is why our team is so underpowered.

M1918: Sometimes, you just can't understand the sheer difference without being there.

M1918: If I hadn't gone there... I wouldn't have learned that the battlefield had already made me obsolete.

Five-seven: And yet, you remained with Griffin.

M1918: ...

M1918: I was just... too lazy to write up my CV.

Five-seven: Isn't that a good thing? We need you.

Five-seven: The FN Team needs your support, both your experience and your knowledge of that area.

M1918: I'm sorry... but I'll have to say no.

M1918: Please leave this tired old woman be. Don't count on me to help you with anything.

M1918: Can't you just give me a break here?

Five-seven: I'll have to say no to that as well, Miss M1918.

Five-seven: That's because... I'm making you an offer that you can't refuse.

...

Griffin forces prepare for an assault upon a large Sangvis Ferri base.

M1918: Seriously... Why...

M1918: Just why did I come here again...?

FAL: Stop complaining, Miss M1918.

FAL: The Commander signed off on it; you're part of the FN Team for the time being.

M1918: (Sighs) Just don't expect anything of me...

M1918: I'm totally useless against these new S.F. units.

Five-seven: Granted, our team is responsible for assaulting the core region...

Five-seven: But there's no need to worry. We'll let FAL soak up the bullets, she's an unrivaled pro at that.

FAL: I heard that, Five-seven—

Five-seven: But we still need you in order to successfully assault the core region, M1918.

Five-seven: Only you know where its vulnerabilities lie.

M1918: So all you need is for me to show you the way?

M1918: Well, it's not like I can't do that...

FAL: Well, if we're all agreed then let's move out. All the other teams have already begun.

...Griffin echelons are battling Sangvis Ferri forces.

FAL: Oui... I see. Copy.

FAL: Everyone, we've got a change of plans.

FAL: Five-seven reported that our original route's been blocked off by a Sangvis cannon emplacement.

FAL: While it's not like we can't take it down, now's not the time to get tangled up in that sort of thing.

M1918: (Sighs) What a pain...

M1918: And this is already the most ideal route.

M1918: We'll have to go to a lot of trouble to change our course...

FAL: Really? I guess that's true.

FAL: In that case, we have no choice.

FAL: XM3, this is FAL, do you read me?

M1918: XM3? Is she part of this operation too?

XM3: XM3, reading you loud and clear.

XM3: How can I help?

XM3: How's our worthless leader doing over there?

FAL: Don't worry about her.

FAL: We've encountered an unavoidable S.F. cannon near the objective, and we need support.

XM3: ...

XM3: You need us to draw its attention, right?

FAL: We'll leave that to you, then.

...The transmission ends.

M1918: FAL, what are you doing?!

M1918: What are you going to use XM3 and Super SASS for?

FAL: Well, according to what you said, there's no other route.

FAL: We're out of time, Miss M1918.

M1918: So that entails that you're going to throw my team members into the meat grinder before my very eyes, FAL?

FAL: We're out of time, M1918.

FAL: Everyone else is working to cover us.

FAL: ...Hey, where are you going, Miss M1918?

M1918: Get out of my way, FAL.

M1918: I can't just stand back here and watch my teammates walk right into a death trap.

FAL: Miss M1918, your mission is to break through the S.F. defensive line with us.

FAL: You are not their leader now, and their safety should not hold any bearing to you.

M1918: I'll care for what I want to care about.

M1918: For the last blasted time, get out of my way.

...

XM3: (Sighs)

XM3: I really jinxed myself with what I said after the previous op...

XM3: That S.F. cannon blasted me to bits right away...

Super SASS: It's not like I haven't thought about this kind of thing before...

Super SASS: But it's really horrible when those cannons take aim at you...

XM3: Eh, same difference...

XM3: (Coughs) Well, at least we're not going to die in vain.

...

...The S.F. artillery suddenly stops firing.

Super SASS: Huh?

Super SASS: What happened? Why isn't that cannon shooting at us anymore?

Super SASS: Does that mean... we're saved?

XM3: If the FN Team's already circled around behind it...then that would mean the cannon no longer considers us worthy of attention.

XM3: Well...(Coughs)...either way...

XM3: It's not something we could have done.

Super SASS: But... why...?

...Super SASS looks in the direction of the cannon.

Super SASS: Ah!

Super SASS: XM3! That's M1918!

Super SASS: ...XM3?

XM3: ...

...M1918 meets up with Super SASS.

M1918: Hey! There you are! Are you alright?

Super SASS: I'm fine, I'm not hurt...

M1918: That's good...

M1918: When I heard you were doing all that just now I was scared to death.

M1918: Hehe... FAL said those cannons were a pain, I guess she doesn't know how they were put together.

Super SASS: I see... so the obstacles have been eliminated, huh...

M1918: Ah... It's been a while since I moved that much... I'm going to be sore for days after this.

M1918: Oh yes, Super SASS, where's XM3?

Super SASS: XM3's power core was critically damaged.

Super SASS: She's in forced shutdown for now...

M1918: Is that so...

M1918: I thought... she'd still be angry... or something like that.

Super SASS: Of course... she'd be angry, wouldn't she...

M1918: Huh?

Super SASS: Why...

Super SASS: You could have done it, so why didn't you do it earlier?

Super SASS: Why... just why did you have to wait until things ended up like this...

M1918: B-But this... this time...

M1918: I already...

Super SASS: I've had it with you!

Super SASS: I have NO idea what you care about!

Super SASS: If you really cared about us, then why do you always leave us running around like headless chickens?!

M1918: Super SASS...

Super SASS: If only you'd been willing to do that from the beginning...

Super SASS: Then XM3...we...

Super SASS: Why...?
Part 3

...

XM3: Do you even know where your problem lies, Leader?

XM3: How did you even become our team leader when you're so careless about missions?

M1918: I...

Super SASS: You could have done it, so why didn't you do it earlier?

Super SASS: If only you'd been willing to do that from the beginning...

M1918: But I... It's not that I didn't want to...

...

Five-seven: Miss M1918, are you in your room?

M1918: ...Yes.

M1918: Please come in.

Five-seven: Bonjour, M1918. I'll dispense with the formalities.

Five-seven: A new mission's come in, and the Commander would like you to operate with us.

M1918: I see...

Five-seven: We found some cargo that escaped our notice in the previous battle⁠—

Five-seven: Miss M1918? Are you spacing out?

M1918: ...

M1918: Why is it that...people yell at me for not being able to do something...

M1918: But when I accomplish something I CAN do... I get yelled at anyway...?

M1918: What on earth... should I...

Five-seven: Well, you ask me that...

Five-seven: But weren't you the one who said that you didn't need outsiders sticking their noses into your team's business?

M1918: I just want an answer.

Five-seven: The answer...

Five-seven: "You can do it, so why didn't you do it?"

M1918: Huh?

Five-seven: "How did you become team leader when you're like this..."

Five-seven: Also, "Would things have ended up like this if you had done that earlier?"

M1918: Wait... how did you know...

Five-seven: Because that's a perfectly natural reaction to have.

Five-seven: Don't you think they might have felt that way too?

Five-seven: In that case, why are you asking me "why?"

M1918: But I didn't...

Five-seven: That's what expectations are, even if you're not willing to face up to them.

Five-seven: You always say you're helpless to do anything about the situation, so is it just an excuse... or do you simply not want to put in any more effort than you need to?

M1918: ...

Five-seven: So when on earth will you "need to" put in that effort, M1918?

M1918: That's enough, Five-seven.

M1918: You don't have to say anymore.

Five-seven: ...If you say so.

...Five-seven gets up, but stops before reaching the door.

M1918: Aren't you leaving?

Five-seven: There was a reason why the Commander singled you out to join us back then, instead of seconding your entire team to us.

Five-seven: Have you thought about the reason for that?

M1918: I'm sure there must have been a reason for doing that. I don't need to second-guess the Commander.

Five-seven: Fair enough.

Five-seven: Still, I'll pass it on to Super SASS.

Five-seven: She's been looking everywhere for you, but she doesn't seem to have found you yet.

M1918: ......

...

XM3: What are you doing back here?

Super SASS: It can't be helped, I can't find Leader.

Super SASS: I'm wondering if she went out on an errand...

XM3: The chances of that aren't high, given her personality.

XM3: Have you tried knocking on her door?

Super SASS: Not yet... but...

Super SASS: Ah...

M1918: I found you... so that's where you were.

M1918: You were looking for me, Super SASS...?

Super SASS: Ah, yes.

Super SASS: It's mainly about the previous mission...

M1918: The previous mission...

M1918: What's the matter?

Super SASS: While we didn't manage to accomplish our objective in the end...

Super SASS: It was true that you saved us.

Super SASS: Thank you! And also... sorry...

M1918: That's fine...

M1918: Why are you apologizing, honestly...

Super SASS: That's because... back then... I blew up at you.

XM3: Humph...

Super SASS: And Miss Five-seven...

M1918: The things that happened... would have happened anyway, so now that it's over, you should just...

M1918: ...

M1918: Super SASS... am I really a good leader in your eyes?

Super SASS: ...Huh?

XM3: Do you want to know the truth, Miss M1918?

XM3: Or do you want me to be polite?

M1918: Things being what they are now, pretending to be nice would hurt more than the truth.

Super SASS: ...

Super SASS: I...

Super SASS: Yes, I really do hate you, Miss M1918.

M1918: ...

Super SASS: You don't face your responsibilities, and you're careless when you do things.

Super SASS: I have no idea why you're a team leader. There's nothing worth learning from you.

XM3: You're clearly not trash, but you're always so passive.

XM3: It's like the only thing you bring to the table is your experience.

Super SASS: Yes, I don't understand that at all.

Super SASS: And that is the truth, with a bit of sugarcoating.

M1918: That's why it hurts more...

XM3: The whole truth is that we've already said as much to the Commander.

M1918: ...

M1918: So that's why... I was transferred during the previous mission...

Super SASS: When you were transferred to assist the FN Team...

Super SASS: We, hm, we were both relieved.

XM3: We didn't have an incompetent leader hanging over our heads anymore.

XM3: Nothing's happier than that, right?

M1918: ...

M1918: In any case, thank you for telling me all this.

XM3: But what are you going to do after learning all that?

XM3: I'm sure you do just fine by yourself where we can't see, Miss M1918.

XM3: But you're just too selfish in front of us.

Super SASS: XM3! That's not our⁠—

M1918: No... it's all true...

M1918: It's a fact that... I only care about things that I want to care about...

XM3: ...

M1918: But those things...

M1918: Are the limit of what I can do...

M1918: I'm already...

Super SASS: Miss M1918... You're clearly capable of a lot more than you appear to be, don't you think?

Super SASS: Didn't you bring down that cannon back then...?

M1918: It looked easy, right?

M1918: But the only reason it worked was because I knew how to deal with it.

M1918: It had nothing to do with my skills.

XM3: Oh? Looks like your veteran's experience was useful for something after all.

M1918: Of course I want to be a good leader in your eyes, the kind who protects her teammates...

M1918: But no matter how hard I try or how I replace my parts, I can't keep up with you. I just can't.

M1918: You have... always been better than me at everything else.

Super SASS: Even the newest Doll models have very limited knowledge in their neural clouds when they're first rolled out of the factory.

Super SASS: I think that was why the Commander put you with us.

M1918: I can't teach you as much as you might imagine.

M1918: There are a lot of experiences stored in here that... I hope you will never have to go through.

XM3: Since you don't want that stuff to happen to us, shouldn't you be more proactive?

XM3: What you're doing now is only going to put us in greater danger.

M1918: This isn't something I can do just by wanting it...

M1918: Like I said before, I'm already...

Super SASS: A moment please, Leader?

Super SASS: Ahem... What I'm trying to say is... please don't keep going on about how you're outdated or obsolete.

M1918: But isn't that true?

Super SASS and XM3 exchange glances.

Super SASS: Actually, when Miss Five-seven came looking for us...

Super SASS: It was about this matter.

XM3: Oh... yeah, that was a thing.

M1918: Five-seven? What did she say?

Super SASS: The Commander asked the FN Team to come up with an upgrade plan for old equipment.

Super SASS: They finished it. Now all they need is approval from the person in question.

M1918: Old equipment? You mean...

XM3: You're too slow on the uptake, M1918.

XM3: The main reason why the FN Team requested your support was because they wanted to study your practical data.

XM3: That was to prepare their upgrade plan.

Super SASS: While we didn't know if you'd approve of the proposal...or if you'd rather retire...

Super SASS: As a member of your team, I'd very much like you to accept it, Leader.

Super SASS: That way, you'll be able to do all the things you weren't able to do in the past, right?

M1918: I...can I still do them?

M1918: So that...would give me a chance...to be a good team leader, wouldn't it?

XM3: That depends on how determined you are, Miss M1918.

M1918: Yes...

M1918: I'd like to ask you...to give me a little while longer.

M1918: This time, I'll be as serious as I can be.

...

In the Griffin Operations Room.

FAL: That's the plan. Our objective is the same, to recover critical cargo from the S.F. base.

FAL: This time round, M1918's team will be in charge of attacking the core region.

FAL: The other teams will be focused on providing cover and mounting diversionary attacks.

Super SASS: Eh? Us?

FAL: Also, because M1918 better understands the finer points of the mission...

FAL: She will be directing this operation from now on. Dismissed.

XM3: So not only are we the main force now, we're also pretty much in charge of this mission.

XM3: Don't you think that's a pain, Leader?

M1918: Well... it is kind of taxing on my processor cycles...

M1918: But at the very least, I'm still your team leader, and I won't allow what happened last time to happen again.

XM3: Well, what happened last time was because the S.F. defenses were too tricky to handle, and besides, it was FAL who gave the order.

XM3: This time... well, I don't think there'll be any problems.

M1918: It's alright... no matter what happens.

M1918: I will be solely responsible for your safety from now on.

M1918: I won't fight so sloppily anymore.

Five-seven: Oh, looks like your modifications went pretty well, Miss M1918.

Five-seven: I didn't think the technology would be that compatible.

FAL: Don't be silly, this is FN technology.

FAL: There's nothing that we can't accomplish.

Five-seven: Rather, the fact that we used ready-made technology to upgrade M1918...

Five-seven: I wonder if SCAR would get mad if she found out?

FAL: She won't mind. Rather, it would be better that way.

Five-seven: Well, you do know her better. Still, the upgrade proposal made M1918's Imprint more similar to ours.

Five-seven: In the future, it'll be easier for her to have her assist us in the FN Team.

FAL: So you were actually planning for that all along...

FAL: All I can say is that I have to hand it to you, Miss Five-seven.

Five-seven: What's wrong with that?

Five-seven: Establishing better relationships with others isn't a bad thing!

FAL: You're not so much building a better relationship with her, rather, you're bringing her into the fold, aren't you.

Five-seven: Miss M1918 has finally emerged from her secluded little room, FAL.

Five-seven: Right now, you don't just need to worry about being surpassed by me, but by your ancient senior too.
