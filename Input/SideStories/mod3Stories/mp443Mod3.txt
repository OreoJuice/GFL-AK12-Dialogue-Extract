...

Serdyukov: ...In the end, Alfa covered us as we broke out of the encirclement.

GSh-18: Oooh!

AK-Alfa: ...You're exaggerating.

AK-Alfa: I was just doing my job, the situation wasn't as bad as you're making it out to be.

FI M82: But you're also very reliable in daily life.

FI M82: You taught me a lot of astronomy facts when we went stargazing together.

AK-Alfa: It's just because it was my hobby... Aw, look what you did, I'm blushing now.

After their mission is over, a group of Dolls gather in the Café, eagerly discussing Alfa's impressive work during their operation.

GSh-18: I envy you guys for being able to go on dispatch all the time.

GSh-18: I'd like to see fancy sights like that in person. I'm sure it'd do my manuscripts a great deal of—

Bam bam bam bam!

Serdyukov: Yeah, what a shame. If you could personally—

Wham!

FI M82: I feel very secure every time I go out on missions with Alfa.

FI M82: I'm glad Alfa's been by my side all this while.

Smack!

AK-Alfa: Er... M82, what did you say? I didn't hear you just now.

AK-Alfa: Could you repeat yourself?

Scratch scratch scratch— bing bang dong!

Serdyukov: ...What on earth are you doing, 443?

Unable to bear it anymore, Serdyukov glares at the customer on the other table who has been making noise all this time.

MP-443: ...Huh? Am I bothering you?

MP-443 has taken up an entire table to herself next to the group.

The table is covered with a pile of strangely-shaped rocks, and 443 has a hammer and chisel in hand, which she is using on a round stone.

Serdyukov: Well, duh!

Serdyukov: All that banging and whacking is just too noisy! Go back to your dorm and do it there!

Serdyukov: Can't you see Miss Springfield is staring at us?

Behind the counter not far away, Springfield is looking at them with a helpless and slightly troubled smile.

But since there are no other guests around, she is not compelled to come over and tell them off.

MP-443: I'm here for GSh-18, but since you guys are busy talking, I've decided to work on my own stuff.

GSh-18: You were looking for me?

MP-443: I went to find you in the clinic, but you weren't there.

MP-443: Miss Kalina said you might be in the Café, so I came over.

FI M82: So...you carry all these rocks with you wherever you go?

MP-443: Hm? That's pretty normal, right? Don't you also carry things you like with you?

MP-443: Also, they're not "rocks"; they're my "stars".

FI M82: Stars? Looks like you've got the same interests as Alfa.

FI M82: Wow, they're so cute!

MP-443: What?

Unsurprisingly, just as MP-443 responds with confusion, AK-Alfa—who has remained silent all this while—rises from her place and leans in to look at the rock MP-443 is holding with some curiosity.

AK-Alfa: I see, these are very interesting handicrafts.

AK-Alfa: But this can hardly be compared to what I like, don't you think? I like real stars.

MP-443: What's that supposed to mean?

MP-443 raises her chin indignantly at that statement and finds Alfa staring down at her with amusement.

MP-443: These don't count as stars, you say? They aren't ordinary "handicrafts", you know.

MP-443: To me, they're treasures that can rival the stars in the sky.

AK-Alfa: ...Really now?

AK-Alfa picks up an unfinished stone.

AK-Alfa: They sure look pretty, but this makes no sense if you're shaping them after real stars.

AK-Alfa: I mean, the most basic thing that you should know is that real stars aren't five-pointed. You do know that, right?

MP-443: ...Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

AK-Alfa: Not at all. I think they're carved very well.

AK-Alfa: However, they are not realistic. I just wanted to say that.

Serdyukov: ...W-w-w-w-wait a minute, calm down, calm down.

Serdyukov: Sorry, I was just complaining about the noise, don't get all confrontational on me.

AK-Alfa: Confrontational? I am simply stating the facts.

AK-Alfa: It's not my intention to make you mad. Just think of it as some friendly advice.

MP-443: Why you—

Alfa takes the stone she's holding and lifts it high. It sparkles with an alluring radiance under the lights.

AK-Alfa: If you want to make them more like real stars, then what you have here just won't do.

MP-443: What...what did you— PUT THAT DOWN!

GSh-18: Alright, alright! Quit arguing! 443, didn't you come here to find me? Well, you have! Let's go! Now!

MP-443: Quit pulling me! I'm going to have it out with her!

AK-Alfa: Hm? Did I say something wrong?

Serdyukov: Not at all... A-Alfa! Movies! Let's go watch a movie!

FI M82: Y-yeah! A good movie, I just bought one!!

AK-Alfa: Er... Okay then.

In the Griffin clinic...

GSh-18: Honestly, that Alfa, she didn't have to go that far, did she? It's just a hobby after all!

GSh-18: And you too! What's there to quarrel about with her? Are you an elementary schooler or something?

MP-443: You don't get it. It's a matter of principle.

443 plops down on the chair with a disgruntled look on her face, her pockets heavy with stones.

GSh-18 sighs in resignation and turns her chair to face the computer screen.

GSh-18: I read your diagnostic report. Miss Kalina was right to send you over to me.

GSh-18: Your neural cloud is a little unstable and I suspect something might be wrong with it, but finding the exact problem will need further examination.

GSh-18: Don't head out on any missions for the time being and have a good rest in the dorm. Let me or Miss Kalina know immediately if anything happens, got that?

MP-443: Wait, seriously? It's that bad?

MP-443: I feel pretty okay though—nothing weird in particular.

MP-443: Oh, but my obsession with rocks seems to have grown stronger recently! Is that because of the malfunction?!

GSh-18: Hm, that sounds pretty normal, but you should still be extra careful.

After putting the report into a file, GSh-18 hands it to MP-443.

MP-443: I've been wanting to ask this for a while now.

MP-443: Why can't you just generate the file in digital format? Why do you have to go out of your way to print it?

GSh-18: Well, there must be a reason why paper files still exist till this day.

GSh-18: Alright, that's enough nonsense out of you, I'm very busy. Get lost already.

MP-443: Is this what you're supposed to say to a friend?!

...

Click.

MP-443: Honestly... She's making a mountain out of a molehill.

MP-443 dumps the report on her bed and heads over to her desk. It's covered in many rocks of different sizes.

She fishes out the rocks from her pockets and carefully arranges them.

MP-443: ...

I can't believe she said these rocks weren't worth a mention... How dare she.

What the hell does Alfa know? What gives her the right to point fingers at me?

MP-443: I'm so mad...

???: What's wrong? Who made you mad?

MP-443: Who else could it be?! It's that AK-Alfa, of course!

MP-443 slams her chisel down onto her desk in frustration as she replies reflexively.

...Hm?

MP-443: Who's in my dorm— A-Alfa?!

AK-Alfa is seated primly at the head of the bed, beside the file that 443 just threw over there.

She blinks and gazes at the startled 443 with the tender expression of someone looking at her best friend.

AK-Alfa: Welcome back, 443!
Part 2

2

Inside the tiny dorm room, MP-443's gawks dumbly at Alfa, who's sitting on the bed.

MP-443: You...you...you you...

AK-Alfa: Good evening, 443.

Alfa looks at MP-443, then pauses for a moment before introducing herself again.

MP-443: —!

AK-Alfa: ...?

Still staring warily at her, MP-443 swiftly approaches her table and sweeps all the rocks there into a bag, then cinches it up tight and hugs it to her chest.

MP-443: You...you came to wreck my stuff, didn't you?

MP-443: Let me tell you—I won't allow it!

MP-443: I will NEVER allow you to touch my rocks!

AK-Alfa: Are you mistaken, perhaps?

AK-Alfa: I believe I made myself very clear this morning, I have no designs on your rocks.

AK-Alfa: I like actual stars, and I was mildly interested in them because you called these rocks stars.

AK-Alfa: But they are fundamentally different things.

AK-Alfa shrugs helplessly.

MP-443: Liar!

MP-443 hugs her rocks even tighter after hearing that.

MP-443: Why would you come here to look for me for no reason?

MP-443: I knew it, you must have been dazzled by my rocks and realized they aren't any worse than real stars.

MP-443: Which is why you've come to steal them, isn't that right?!

AK-Alfa: Now where did that self-confidence come from... I mean, what's so special about these rocks?

AK-Alfa: Can't you find them everywhere outside?

MP-443: Ha! Amateur!

MP-443 puffs up her chest, then loosens the string on her bag and produces a rock from it.

This particular piece has been cut into a polyhedral star shape. It is semi-transparent and its clarity contains the occasional glint of laser-like brilliance.

MP-443: Fluorites like these are formed from cooled lava. They're very brittle, so shaping them is very difficult.

MP-443: This particular piece has a good color, and with my masterful carving, I'm sure it's no less brilliant than the morning star!

AK-Alfa: It is, actually. Much less brilliant, I mean.

AK-Alfa: But this carving IS exquisite. I'm impressed by how delicate the points are and that you didn't smash them.

MP-443: Shut up! There's also this one!

AK-Alfa: Isn't this an ordinary cobblestone!

MP-443: Humph! You're a SUPER amateur!

AK-Alfa: There you go calling me an amateur again... Why don't you tell me about it, then?

MP-443: It looks good, doesn't it?!

AK-Alfa: You're right, it does look good.

AK-Alfa: I've seen many cobblestones in my time, but this one is almost perfectly shaped.

AK-Alfa: The patterns on it are also very interesting, it looks like Saturn.

MP-443: Yep! What the hell, you know this stuff, don't you?!

AK-Alfa: And? How is it special?

MP-443: ...Because it looks really pretty!

AK-Alfa: ...Alright, I know they're your babies. Relax, I won't do anything to them.

AK-Alfa sighs and rises from the bed.

Startled by her movement, MP-443 cautiously withdraws, still holding her bag of rocks protectively.

AK-Alfa: Earlier today, at the Café, you were deliberately trying to get our attention, weren't you?

MP-443: ...What nonsense are you talking about? I have no idea what you're saying.

AK-Alfa: No need to lie. The rocks you were working on back then were just ordinary rocks, weren't they?

AK-Alfa: Also, you were just banging on them with your hammer. If you had used a little force, they would have crumbled completely.

AK-Alfa: That isn't part of carving rocks, you were just making noise. They didn't realize it, but I did.

MP-443: You...

MP-443 looks suspiciously at AK-Alfa.

MP-443: ...So you knew?

AK-Alfa: Also, the ones you just showed me aren't even your favorites, are they?

AK-Alfa: Your most precious rock is in that safe over there, the black meteorite that you emptied your savings to buy.

AK-Alfa: You haven't dared touch it yet because you're deathly afraid of breaking it, aren't you?

MP-443: You—!

MP-443 jumps to her feet.

MP-443: How did you know that?!

AK-Alfa: Hehe... I wonder?

AK-Alfa approaches MP-443 smilingly, her expression a little bizarre and a little unsettling.

AK-Alfa: You...

MP-443: W-wait, wait! Don't come so close to me!! Get lost!

Whoosh—

MP-443 panics as Alfa draws close to her, and so she forcefully shoves the latter away—

MP-443: ...Huh?

AK-Alfa: Oh dear, I guess the cat is out of the bag.

Her hand passes clean through Alfa's chest. There is no sensation, like she's grabbing a handful of air.

MP-443: You...you...

MP-443's eyes widen. She wiggles the hand inside Alfa's chest, but she still can't feel anything.

Is this Alfa...a non-existent phantom?

AK-Alfa: Oh well, since you've found me out, I ought to introduce myself. I'm—

MP-443: Are you my Astral Guardian?!

AK-Alfa: ...

MP-443: ...

AK-Alfa: ...I have to admit, I'm really amazed by how you arrived at that conclusion.

MP-443: No, that can't be it.

MP-443 shakes her head, then walks right through Alfa's body with her bag of stones in hand before arriving at her bed.

AK-Alfa: Hang on... Even if I AM an illusion, that's still pretty rude...

MP-443 ignores her and picks up the file that she dumped on her bed.

MP-443: You-you're a hallucination! So my neural cloud really is busted after all, isn't it?!

"AK-Alfa": Bingo~ You got it, looks like you're not as dumb as you look.

MP-443: How is this normal?!

MP-443: Wait a minute, It's one thing to be hallucinating... But why does it have to be Alfa?!

"AK-Alfa": Who knows? I don't.

"AK-Alfa": Since it's YOUR hallucination, why don't you ask yourself?

Having dropped all pretense, "AK-Alfa" smiles playfully in a way that the real AK-Alfa never would.

MP-443's face twitches — she doesn't know Alfa all that well, but however dumb she might be, even she knows that the real Alfa would never act like this...

MP-443: I knew it... How could she know so much about rocks...

"AK-Alfa": Hm? What did you say?

MP-443: I must be mad... I need to go look for GSh-18.

"AK-Alfa": Aw, what's the rush? Why don't you think it over? What are you going to say to her, anyway?

"AK-Alfa": That your neural cloud is so messed up you're seeing things and talking to an imaginary friend?

"AK-Alfa": That said imaginary friend is AK-Alfa, with whom you just had a fight? How do you think she'd look at you?

MP-443: ...

"AK-Alfa": Alright, have you calmed down a little yet?

MP-443: You said you knew the meteorite was in the safe, right?

"AK-Alfa": Yeah, I AM your hallucination, after all. Frankly speaking, no one knows you better than I do.

MP-443: What is the pass code for the safe?

"AK-Alfa": It's 667259.

MP-443 suddenly stands up and heads for the door.

"AK-Alfa": Where are you going?

MP-443: To see a doctor.

"AK-Alfa": Wait, wait a minute! I know the code, but that's all! I'm just a hallucination! I can't steal it!

At the clinic—

GSh-18: So you think you have severe issues with your neural cloud?

MP-443: Yes, so I'd like you to give me another checkup.

GSh-18: Well, even if you say that...

GSh-18 turns aside to look at the display.

GSh-18: Your data looks pretty normal, you know?

"AK-Alfa": She says you're normal, you hear that?

MP-443: That can't be.

MP-443 looks unflinchingly at GSh-18.

MP-443: Please check again, more carefully this time.

"AK-Alfa": Are you so eager to get rid of me?

"AK-Alfa": I think we get along pretty well, you know? Look, she can't see me.

GSh-18: Alright, but...

GSh-18 fiddles around with the machine for a bit and checks the result again.

GSh-18: There's nothing here. Your data's perfectly normal.

MP-443: ...

GSh-18: Did something happen to you, 443?

Seeing the gloomy look on 443's face, GSh-18 ventures a worried question.

"AK-Alfa": She's asking you a question. Why don't you answer her?

MP-443: WILL YOU STOP BOTHERING ME ALREADY?!

GSh-18: What... I'm just concerned about you, you know?!

MP-443: Er, no, that's not right, I wasn't talking to you... No, it's nothing.

MP-443 is about to say more but promptly changes her mind. "Alfa", who's making faces at her nearby, is driving her up the wall.

MP-443: Forget it! If you say I'm fine, then I'm fine! I'm leaving!

GSh-18: Wait! Tell me what you meant!

After fleeing from the clinic, MP-443 rests her hands on her knees in front of the door and takes a deep breath.

"AK-Alfa": You DO know you're going to hurt others' feelings like that, right? She was just concerned about you.

"AK-Alfa": You don't have any lasting friends because you're always like this.

MP-443: Why don't you shut up?! How is this any of your business?!

"AK-Alfa": There's no point getting mad at me either.

"AK-Alfa": I don't exist, I'm just a figment of your imagination.

"AK-Alfa": If you're angry, it's because I'm saying the things that you're keeping in your heart.

AK-Alfa blinks and continues to stare evenly at 443, who's glaring at her.

"AK-Alfa": You'd better apologize to GSh-18 and explain the situation to her.

MP-443: Who are you to boss me around?

MP-443: Who do you think you are, anyway?

With those cold words, MP-443 dismisses her own hallucination and heads back to her dorm.

...

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: ...Wait, don't tell me there really IS something wrong with her... Oh no, I need to inform Miss Kalina!
Part 3

MP-443: ...

GSh-18: ...It was just last night.

Serdyukov: Really...?

The oppressive atmosphere in the morning cafeteria is so heavy that it's threatening to crush the table. MP-443 is focused on eating her breakfast wordlessly. Beside her, two of her friends are muttering to each other and occasionally pointing to 443.

"AK-Alfa": I'm sure they must be talking about your weirdness.

MP-443: ...And whose fault is that?

Serdyukov: She-she's doing it again!

GSh-18: 443... Uh, about that checkup... I-I've already submitted the results to Miss Kalina for vetting.

GSh-18: Um, but you absolutely have to make sure you tell us if you're having any difficulties, okay?

"AK-Alfa": Aw... I'm so touched. Is this friendship?

"AK-Alfa": I think I'm about to shed a tear...

MP-443: Do you mind? You're grossing me out...

GSh-18: Say what?

MP-443: Wasn't talking to you.

GSh-18: ...

Serdyukov: ...

The two of them give 443 strange looks and back away slowly and simultaneously.

Serdyukov: Er, I-I'm full... Uh, we'll be off first then, 443?

GSh-18: Er... Um, I'll let you know right away once the report comes back!

GSh-18: Before that, make sure you stay put in the base and don't head outside!

MP-443: Got it.

443 doesn't seem bothered by their hasty retreat and shrugs.

"AK-Alfa": Is this really okay?

MP-443: Look at me, since when have I cared about this sort of thing?

"AK-Alfa": Oh yeah~ Since when did the independent, proud and unbound Lady 443 care about how other people thought and felt?

MP-443: Quit bothering me.

"AK-Alfa": Fine, fine, I'll shut up.

MP-443 continues eating her breakfast. After a long time, she finishes the last bite and wipes her mouth with a tissue.

Springfield: Would you like anything else?

Upon noticing 443's plate is empty, Springfield comes over with a smile.

MP-443: No, thank you.

443 shakes her head and courteously declines the offer.

Springfield: Alright, then do your best today!

Springfield: Ah, hello and welcome.

After exchanging some quick greetings, Springfield steps out from behind the counter to address new customers who have just arrived.

MP-443: Whew...

443 sniffs and pushes the plate in front of her away. Just then, someone seems to have taken a seat beside her.

She turns to look, but all she sees is "Alfa".

MP-443: Anyway.

MP-443: You'll be accompanying me up the mountain north of the base later, right?

MP-443: I want to go dig up some new rocks.

AK-Alfa: ...Huh?

AK-Alfa: Are you talking to me?

MP-443: Who else could it be?

MP-443: Of course I'm talking to you.

AK-Alfa: Er... Well, it's true that I don't have anything planned for later.

MP-443: Well, what COULD you be doing, anyway?

443 snorts and stands up with her plate in hand.

MP-443: Let's go. The weather should be perfect for this.

443 tilts her head to the side and looks at Alfa.

MP-443: Got a problem with that?

AK-Alfa: ...Not really.

AK-Alfa: Since you've invited me along, I'll keep you company.

MP-443: Yes yes~ You're doing me such an honor~

AK-Alfa: ...

...

The two Dolls struggle to climb the hilly wilderness as wildly-blowing winds set the tree branches fluttering.

AK-Alfa: W-wait... MP-443!

MP-443: Ah... This looks like a good piece— Now what?

AK-Alfa: Is this what you meant by perfect weather?!

AK-Alfa: The wind's so strong... Is it really okay to climb a mountain in this weather?

MP-443: I'm not scared of it, so why should you be?

MP-443: It's on days like these when the surface soil is blown away that the rocks underneath are revealed!

AK-Alfa: Rocks? Are rocks that important?!

MP-443: What the heck are you talking about? Of COURSE rocks are important!

MP-443: They're my one and only—and greatest passion!!

AK-Alfa: B-but this is really dangerous!

AK-Alfa: I suggest we head back!

MP-443: It's fine... It's not like...this is my first time...coming here!!

MP-443: You're just...a hallucination... It's not like you'll get blown away!

MP-443: What are you worried about?!

AK-Alfa: A hallucination? What are you talking about—

AK-Alfa: H-Hold on! 443!~ Look out!!

MP-443: What...did you say...??

AK-Alfa: Up top!! Look out!! Rock!!

MP-443: Saaayyy whaaaaat?

443 looks up in confusion—

A rock the size of an ostrich egg is falling out of the sky.

Doink!

...

GSh-18: ...Didn't I tell you not to leave the base?

MP-443: Did you?

GSh-18: I did!

GSh-18 scratches her head.

GSh-18: If Miss Alfa hadn't been with you, you'd be rotting in the mountains by yourself!

AK-Alfa: Well, Miss 443 did invite me along.

GSh-18: Since when were you two on such good terms?

MP-443: Wait... You can see her?

GSh-18: ...?

AK-Alfa: ...Er, what do you mean, 443?

GSh-18: Is...is there something wrong with your head again?

"AK-Alfa": I'm sooooo worried~ 443~

MP-443: —!

443's eyes go wide as she sees two "Alfas" in front of her.

The one in the back cheekily sticks her tongue out, then floats over to 443's side and collapses into an uncontrollable giggling fit.

MP-443: S-so you're the one...who saved me?

AK-Alfa: ...I thought we've already established that?

AK-Alfa: Are you really alright, 443?

MP-443: No...I... Uh... I'm fine.

GSh-18: The checkup didn't find any other problems, just that you shouldn't move around too much in the short term.

AK-Alfa: It's good that she's alright.

AK-Alfa: I now fully understand your passion towards rocks, but please don't do something dangerous like that again.

GSh-18: Thank you very much for your help.

MP-443: Just you remember this...

MP-443 grabs her blanket resentfully and mutters under her breath.

Only one person knows who she's talking to.

"AK-Alfa": Haha, well, can't be helped. Who would have known that the original would show up then?

"AK-Alfa": All I could do was hide. Besides, things didn't turn out all that bad.

"AK-Alfa": I mean, I don't even count as a person. I can't even help you call for help.

MP-443: ...But you could have spoken to me.

GSh-18: Of course I could, but I had other things to do.

GSh-18: Listen up, your body is very badly damaged. Be good and stay in the infirmary for now. No running around.

MP-443: Ehh? Wait, wait, no! It'll be super boring!

MP-443: Can't you just fix me up right away?

AK-Alfa: I think this is a very wise decision.

AK-Alfa: It was fortunate that I was accompanying her this time. It would be a hassle if Miss 443 headed out alone and encountered something like that again.

AK-Alfa: You look like the sort of person who would do that.

MP-443: (Groans)

"AK-Alfa": Hahaha~ She has you dead to rights.

GSh-18: We'll carry out the repair work once we get your neural cloud diagnostic report.

GSh-18: Take this as a good opportunity to settle down and get some rest!

MP-443: C'mon! At least give me my rocks!

GSh-18: Don't even think about it! We have to handle human patients here too! Don't disregard the amount of work that goes into disinfecting this place!

MP-443: But why—

AK-Alfa: That's how it is. Please get well soon and don't let your imagination run wild.

AK-Alfa: We'll come back later.

MP-443: H-Hold on! Don't go!

Ka-click.

The room door closes ruthlessly.

MP-443: ...

"AK-Alfa": There, there. Come now, look over here, 443.

MP-443: What do you want?! I'm in a really bad mood right— hm?!

After GSh-18 has left the ward, MP-443 turns to glare grumpily at "Alfa", but her eyes widen immediately in shock.

"Alfa" smirks; she's holding MP-443's most beloved black meteorite.

MP-443: W-wait! Didn't you say there's no way you could steal it?! Give it back!

"AK-Alfa": Relax, your stone's still sitting in your safe.

"AK-Alfa": This one...is mine.

MP-443: ...Yours?

MP-443 reaches out to grab the meteorite that "Alfa" is holding, but her fingers only make contact with empty air.

MP-443: How...

"AK-Alfa": I'm a hallucination, remember, 443?

"AK-Alfa": I can't bring your rocks over, but I can create illusions like this to show them to you.

MP-443: ...Well that just feels empty.

"AK-Alfa": Oh? Do you have to be so blunt?

"AK-Alfa": The illusions I create look just like the real thing, you know... And I can produce anything as long as your neural cloud has the appropriate data.

"AK-Alfa": Do you know what that means?

MP-443: So you're saying... You can conjure rocks that I haven't been able to find?!

"AK-Alfa": Hehe—

MP-443: Even a huge meteorite...!

"AK-Alfa": Hehehe—!!

MP-443: Even the entire moon—!!

"AK-Alfa": Not that.

MP-443: Tsk.

"AK-Alfa": Be realistic! Even if I could make something like that, do you think this place could hold it?!

MP-443: Aw, I was just wondering. In any case, I'm bored, so hurry up and bring out about 70 or 80 rocks for me to enjoy.

"AK-Alfa": What a slavedriver you are...

"Alfa" grumbles a little, but she nevertheless produces all manner of strange rocks for MP-443.

There is the fluorite from before, bigger and better cobblestones, and even some ores that can't be found in modern times—up to and including real diamonds!

They come in all shapes and sizes, all the colors of the rainbow, some of them so rare she's only ever read about them in books, but all of them are floating in front of MP-443, within her arm's reach. Apart from the fact that she can't touch them, they're no different from the real thing.

MP-443: ...

As she takes in this array of treasures, 443's eyes go wide with wonder and sparkle with a glint that they have never had before.

Part 4

In the Griffin medical ward—

"AK-Alfa": Speaking of which...

MP-443: What is it?

MP-443 is staring at the spectacular variety of stones before her, transfixed, when "Alfa" chimes in from beside her.

"AK-Alfa": Don't you think you've been too cold to GSh-18 and the others recently?

"AK-Alfa": Every time they come by for a routine checkup, it's as though you can't chase them away fast enough.

"AK-Alfa": I mean, there were a few times when they wanted to stay behind and talk to you.

MP-443: Well, if they don't go, you can't come out.

MP-443: That would keep me from looking at rocks. This is a rare opportunity to view rare and precious stones from around the world up close.

MP-443: I won't waste a moment of that time.

"AK-Alfa": ...

With a whoosh, the marvelous array of rocks vanishes from before MP-443's eyes.

"AK-Alfa": 443...

"Alfa" stands next to 443 and looks sternly at her.

"AK-Alfa": You see, I know very well that you're actually terrified of being alone.

"AK-Alfa": That's why my presence cheers you up, right?

MP-443: What kind of nonsense is that... Who's scared of being alone?

MP-443: I can get by just fine by myself, you know? I'll be okay as long as I have these rocks.

"AK-Alfa": I also know that's not what you're thinking.

MP-443: What do you know?

MP-443 sits up on her bed.

"AK-Alfa": I AM you, which is why I know you best.

MP-443: ...

"AK-Alfa": It's okay if you don't admit it.

"AK-Alfa": But you can't keep relying on me. I'm just a hallucination. I don't exist. Whether or not you admit it, these are the facts.

"AK-Alfa": I'm just like those rocks. However rare or pretty they are, they can't really be seen or touched, and they'll vanish without a trace with just a slight puff of wind.

"AK-Alfa": What you should be looking for are rocks of your own, not these illusions.

"AK-Alfa": And you shouldn't be wasting so much time on me. You should cherish your friends more.

"AK-Alfa": Otherwise all you can do is throw tantrums by yourself like this.

MP-443: GOD YOU'RE SO ANNOYING!

"AK-Alfa": ...

"AK-Alfa" closes her eyes.

"AK-Alfa": I didn't mean to make you mad. I just hope you can look ahead to the future..

MP-443: You're just a hallucination... Don't go lecturing me about how I live my life.

MP-443: I may let you hang around, but that doesn't mean I'm attached or anything.

"AK-Alfa": I know. After all, I don't even exist.

"AK-Alfa": I am you, and the fact that I can say all this means that you also understand it.

"AK-Alfa": You have friends in other people, not me.

MP-443: ...I don't want to talk to you for now.

MP-443: Go away.

"AK-Alfa": ...I won't be around forever, 443.

"AK-Alfa" smiles humorlessly with a rare look of helplessness on her face as she fades away.

MP-443: ...

...

GSh-18: Miss Kalina handed me the approval form.

GSh-18: 443, you can go in for your neural upgrade now.

MP-443: ...What?

MP-443 has not seen "Alfa" ever since that afternoon.

And shortly after that, GSh-18 dropped a bombshell during a routine checkup.

GSh-18: Miss Persica thinks that the "neural cloud abnormalities" you're experiencing are a side effect of your neural cloud growing.

GSh-18: Your current body can't support a neural cloud as strong as yours, so you'll need to be upgraded ASAP.

MP-443: W-when will that be?

GSh-18: The sooner the better, of course. We can even do it now, if you don't have anything else planned.

MP-443: Right now?! Isn't that a bit too hasty?

MP-443: I-I haven't...

MP-443 looks around herself but sees no sign of that noisy figure.

GSh-18: Do you have any concerns about the procedure?

MP-443: ...Not really.

MP-443: It's just that it feels a little too sudden.

GSh-18: It kind of is, but there's no need to worry, this is bound to be a good thing.

GSh-18: Relax, Alfa and I will both be there, if not today, then tomorrow.

GSh-18: We'll take a day off and once you get upgraded, we'll have our first drink together in a long time.

MP-443: ...

MP-443 stares blankly at GSh-18. That's when she spots AK-Alfa standing outside her ward.

Her upright and dignified demeanor is dramatically different from the "Alfa" that MP-443 has been seeing day in, day out.

GSh-18: While you're hospitalized, Alfa has been collecting lots of rocks for you during missions...

GSh-18: We aren't to educated on the subject though, so we just picked the ones that looked good to us.

GSh-18: Hope you don't mind.

MP-443: I-I don't mind at all... Uh, thank you.

GSh-18: Not at all. We're friends, after all.

GSh-18 smiles.

The sight renders MP-443 speechless for a long time.

GSh-18: So, have you decided?

MP-443: Well...

"AK-Alfa": Good luck.

MP-443: ...?!

A quiet voice suddenly speaks into MP-443's ear. She immediately lifts her head, but there is nobody there.

MP-443: ...

GSh-18: 443? Are you alright?

Taking in the strange look on 443's face, GSh-18 inquires anxiously.

MP-443: Yes... I'm completely fine.

MP-443 lets out a long exhale. She feels as if she has gained some kind of strength.

MP-443: I'm ready whenever you are.

MP-443: Let's take care of this ASAP.

...

...

...

...

GSh-18: Are you awake? The upgrade went very well. How do you feel? Can you move?

MP-443: ...

MP-443 emerges from the upgrade capsule. She stares blankly at her hands, then she looks up and around at her surroundings.

GSh-18: ?

GSh-18: Is something the matter?

MP-443: ...No.

443 smiles and puts a hand on GSh-18's head. Then she turns and finds AK-Alfa standing at the entrance to the room, gazing at her.

443 flinches a little at the sight of her.

AK-Alfa: Congratulations on your upgrade, 443.

AK-Alfa: Here, it's a getting-out-of-hospital gift.

Completely oblivious to 443's awkwardness, she smiles and hands over a bulging bag of heavy rocks.

MP-443: ...Thank you.

MP-443: Sorry for causing you trouble lately.

AK-Alfa: Don't mention it. I've also been enjoying myself.

AK-Alfa: These rocks are more interesting than I expected.

GSh-18: Oh yes, since it's not often that the weather's so good, why don't we go mountain-climbing today?

GSh-18: Think of it as a celebration. We'll go dig up some rocks and have a picnic. How about that?

AK-Alfa: That's a good idea. Let's invite Serdyukov too.

AK-Alfa: She has also been worried about you all this time.

MP-443: ...Alright, we'll all go together.

MP-443: I'll teach you all about the differences of each kind of rock.

AK-Alfa: I'm looking forward to it.

MP-443 grins as she leaves the upgrade lab hand-in-hand with her two friends.

As the trio walk off into the distance and the door slowly closes behind them, MP-443 glances back.

The hazy, phantasmal figure completely vanishes behind her.
