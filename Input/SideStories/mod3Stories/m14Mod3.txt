In the T-Doll Repair Bay at Griffin.

Kalin: Phew, all done!

Kalin: You can come out now, M14.

M14: Okay, we're coming out!

M14: Thank you so much, Miss Kalin!

Kalin: Heheh, you're welcome. Just be more careful next time.

Kalin: Actually, you seem to be coming for repairs pretty frequently these days...

M14: Sorry to have caused any trouble, but we'll watch it in the future!

M14: We'll be off now. Thanks again, Miss Kalin!

M14 gives Kalin a deep bow, then bounces away.

Kalin: ...Will she really watch it?

Kalin: Sigh, never mind. I'll leave this to whoever wants to worry about it.

In a Griffin dorm.

M14: Hmm, why is the dorm completely empty...?

M14: Where is everybody?

OUTTA MY WAAAAAY!!

M14: Huh?

M14: WHOA!

A T-Doll crashes right into M14 from behind.

M14 turns and sees M9 with a large box in her arms, stumbling to regain her balance.

M9: Ouch, that hurt! I told you to get outta my way!

M9: ...Hmm? If it isn't M14. I remember you coming back in two halves last time. Didn't think you'd get out of the repair bay so soon.

M14: All thanks to Miss Kalin, we're strong as an ox!

M14: By the way, why isn't anybody in the dorm?

M9: Why else? They've all left on a mission.

M14: Mission? But we weren't notified.

M9: Of course you weren't notified lying around in a repair bay.

M9: Right, I've got no time to chat. Our leader is still waiting for my rations.

M9 jogs off with the box.

M14: We didn't even know there's a mission...

M14: We can't miss out on it! We'll go look for our squad leader now!

At the entrance of the Griffin Base.

M14: Thompson! Thompsooooon!

Thompson: M14? Why are you here?

Thompson: I'm pretty sure I didn't recruit you on this mission.

M14: There IS a new mission, right? Bring us along!

Thompson: No.

M14: Huh? Why?

Thompson: Have you counted how many times you've entered the repair bay in the last two weeks?

M14: One...two...three...four...oh! Five times!

Thompson: Yeah. That's also the exact number of times we engaged enemy units in battle on our missions in the last two weeks.

M14: Well...we-we'll do our best not to get hurt!

Thompson: It's true that loss is inevitable in battle.

Thompson: But that doesn't mean you can run amok recklessly in a fight.

Thompson: If you can't promise you won't do that, then don't bother to come. I don't have the luxury to spare manpower on taking care of you if you're badly injured.

M14: But...but we're also part of the team!

M14: We really want to be of help on the field!

Thompson: Do I have to spell it out? You're the one being helped on the field right now.

M14: Oh...

Thompson: If you really want to be helpful, just stay put at the base.

Thompson: Run some logistics if you're bored. Both we and Kalin would be very grateful.

M14: We...understand.

M14 trudges off miserably.

M1911: Wasn't that a bit too much, Thompson?

Thompson: It's about time she calmed down and thought things through. Idiots with nothing but keenness will only end up dead here.

Thompson: Metal scrap lying limp on the ground can never see the sights from high above... True victory belongs to the last person standing.

M1911: You're right.

M1911: But we can't just shelf her indefinitely. We gotta think of a way to help her with her condition.

Thompson: She'll have help.

Thompson: We have no shortage of keen idiots here.

In the Griffin dorm.

M21: Why are you sitting here all alone, M14?

M14: M21...

M14: You're not on the mission either?

M21: This mission doesn't require sniper support so I'm on break.

M21: What is it though? You look like the loan sharks are here to get you.

M14: Thompson doesn't want us on missions...

M21: Huh? Why is that?

M14: Because...

M14 repeats what Thompson said.

M21: Oh...

M21: Don't be too upset. I'm sure Thompson is only concerned about your safety...

M14: But we don't want to be left behind on our own...

M14: We want to fight side by side with our teammates! We don't wanna lose to anyone!

M21: You're not left behind on your own... I'm here with you, aren't I?

M14: But you'll leave as well when you have a mission...

M14: But we...we'll never get that chance again...

M21: Ah... Then we have to make the most of the time we spend together now...

M21: Right, wanna hear a joke?

M14: Will Thompson take us on missions after hearing it?

M21: Uh, well... Uh...haha...

M14: We want to grow stronger...

M14: We want to be strong enough so Thompson won't think we're a deadweight!

M21: Then...let me think...

M21: You can't improve just sitting around... Why don't you ask Miss Kalin if there's any work you can help her with?

M14: What?

M21: Even running logistics is a kind of training!

M21: I'm sure everyone will be very glad to see a heap of supplies when they come back from the mission!

M14: Logistics, huh...

M14: But we still want to be part of the fight.

M21: You'll have to win Thompson's recognition before that though.

M14: Then how can we win her recognition?

M21: If you can't join them in battle, you'll have to prove your mettle some other way!

M21: There is a lot of work to do around the base, and you're always full of energy. You can do this, M14!

M14: Hmm...you have a point. Then we'll give it a go!

M14: Thanks a lot, M21!

M21: Heheh, don't mention it.

M21: We're sisters. Don't hesitate to come to me for anything.

M14: We'll be off then!

M14: We'll definitely convince Thompson to take us onto the battlefield again!
Part 2

At the Griffin base.

M1911 hears some faint gunshots coming from the shooting range.

M1911: Hmm? Who's practicing at this time of night?

M1911: ...Guess I'll go take a look.

M1911 leaves the database and makes her way to the shooting range.

M14: Oh, M1911!

M14: Good evening!

M1911: Good evening, M14.

M1911: Was that you shooting just now?

M14: Yeah. We couldn't sleep so we came to practice!

M14: Are you also here to practice?

M1911: No, I'm here to look through the kids' training data.

M1911: The mission in two days is gonna be tough so we're preparing as thoroughly as we can.

M14: Another mission?

M14: But we guess you won't be taking us this time either...

M1911: Well...I'm afraid I can't answer that right now.

M1911: Candidates for the mission are chosen depending on the job requirement.

M14: Thompson doesn't want us on missions. Miss Kalin doesn't want us at work. Even other T-Dolls don't want our help...

M14: Are we only causing everyone trouble?

M1911: Miss Kalin? Other T-Dolls?

M1911: M14...what have you been up to in the last few days?

M14: (Sobs)

M14: These couple days...we've been...

M1911: Slow down. Let's sit down and hear it...

Three days ago, in the warehouse at the Griffin base.

M14: We're back, Miss Kalin!

Kalin: Oh, M14. Have you brought the supplies?

M14: All here!

Kalin: Great. Let me check...

Kalin inspects the supplies delivered by M14.

Kalin: That's not right... There should be 40 boxes this time. Why are we missing so many?

M14: That can't be right.

M14: This is all we saw at the factory warehouse.

Kalin: The factory only provided...these supplies, M14?

M14: The person in charge said all the goods were at the warehouse reserved for Griffin, so we moved all the boxes outside the warehouse over here!

Kalin: ...What about those INSIDE the warehouse?

M14: Inside the warehouse?

Kalin: All our goods are always placed together... I told you as much before you set off.

M14: Oh!

M14: W-we're sorry...we forgot.

Kalin: Can't be helped. I'm afraid you'll have to make another trip.

Kalin: But the supply schedule is ruined for the day. What a pain...

Kalin: You'd better not miss a single box this time, M14.

M14: We're really sorry...Miss Kalin.

Kalin: Alright, alright. Just go.

M1911: I see...

M1911: There's more, right?

M14: Yeah...

The previous morning.

Kalin: M14, I have to go and inspect a new delivery.

Kalin: If anyone comes asking for supplies while I'm gone, tell them to wait here.

M14: Okay!

Kalin: Right, then I'll be back soon.

Kalin: I'm leaving things here to you.

Kalin leaves the warehouse.

STEN: Miss Kalin, I'm here for ammo-

STEN: M14? Why are you here? Where's Miss Kalin?

M14: She's off to inspect a new delivery!

M14: We're watching the warehouse for her while she's gone.

STEN: Did she say when she'll be back?

M14: Soon, she said!

STEN: Hmm, then I'll wait here.

...20 minutes later.

STEN: Why isn't she back yet...? I'm running out of time.

M14: Are you on some urgent business, Sten?

STEN: Yeah, our team has to go on an emergency mission. I need to get some ammo pronto.

M14: Then just take it first.

M14: We'll tell Miss Kalin when she comes back!

STEN: Huh? Is that okay?

STEN: I think it's better if I wait till she's here...

M14: But aren't you in a hurry?

STEN: I am... My leader was rushing me just now.

STEN: Hmm...can't be helped.

STEN: I'm taking these then. Please apologize to Miss Kalin on my behalf when she's back.

M14: Okay, we'll definitely tell her!

...A few minutes later.

Kalin: Jeez. Suppliers nowadays are SO tenacious...

Kalin: I'm back, M14. Did anyone come by?

M14: Sten was here!

M14 tells Kalin about what happened.

Kalin: ...WHAT?! You let Sten take the ammo?!

M14: Because she looked like she was in a hurry, you know.

Kalin rushes over to the shelves and checks the ammunition.

Kalin: Arghhhhh!!

Kalin: She took blank rounds used for practice!!

Kalin: I need to tell the Commander right now!!

M14: That's what happened...

M14: We wanted to do our logistic duties properly, but we always ended up causing trouble.

M1911: Looks like you've been apologizing all the time...

M14: Will Thompson sack us, M1911?

M14: We want to stay here with everyone at Griffin... We don't want to have our core removed and get sent away...

M1911: Slow down, slow down. Things are that bad yet...

M1911: Right. Since you've been practicing, mind if I take a look at your data? I might find something you're good at.

M14: Really?

M14: Can we really come back to the team?

M1911: You never left, M14.

M14: What?

M1911: We only hope you can readjust yourself and come back on duty at a better time.

M1911: If all you care about is playing the hero and sulk in defeat whenever you botch something up, how could you expect anyone to trust you with their backs?

M14: We...we simply...don't want to be abandoned...

M1911: We haven't abandoned you...

M1911 kneels down and looks at M14.

M1911: If you don't want to give up, then calm down and find something that you really want to do.

M14: We've tried many things, but none of them really worked out.

M1911: Were you actually trying, or were you just trying to get lucky?

M1911: Have you put in any effort for what you want?

M14: Effort...

M1911: That's right. Put in the effort until you're up for the job.

M1911: It's like love... If you don't make an effort, you'll never know the darling of your dreams. If you don't give everything you've got, you'll never win their heart.

M14: That's an odd metaphor...

M14: But...we think we get it.

M14: Yeah, we'll do our best! For what we want to do!

M1911: Great. So, since I'm here anyway...let me see the results from your practice just now.

M1911 pulls up M14's shooting data.

M1911: Hmm...

M14: ...Is it terrible?

M1911: No...it's much better than I expected.

M1911: Perhaps rather than being in the vanguard, M14, you'd be more suited for providing cover from the back.

M14: Providing cover? Like M21?

M1911: That's right. You'll have to stay back to give support. This will make your fighting style vastly different than what you're used to.

M1911: You'll have to rein in your personality to maximize the use of your Imprinted weapon.

M14: Our Imprint...

M14: We're not sure if we can do that...

M1911: It depends on how much change you're willing to make.

M1911: Learning to compromise is also a kind of effort, you know.

M14: Compromise...is also a kind of effort?

M1911: In a team, everyone has to sacrifice a bit of themselves in order to work side by side with each other.

M1911: This kind of sacrifice isn't always noticeable, but it's essential to achieving victory.

M14: Have you, and has Miss Thompson also made this compromise?

M1911: If you know how Thompson used to do things, you'll realize how easy we have it now.

M1911: If you really want to help us, then you have to change.

M1911: Well? If you want to give that a try, I can talk to Thompson and ask her to take you on our next mission.

M14: ...

M14: We want to fight with you.

M14: It doesn't matter from which position. We'll do our best!

M14: We'll also work hard on our shortcomings in order to stay with you...

M14: So...please, M1911, please ask Thompson to let us fight!

M1911: I can see that you do have the determination. I'll keep my promise.

M1911: But next time, if you still charge straight to the front, Thompson might really just tear out your core and dump it in a coal mine...

M14: Ughh... That's scary...

M1911: Haha, just kidding.

M1911: Then I look forward to your performance!

M1911: Don't disappoint us, okay?
Part 3

Squad Thompson in the middle of a mission.

M1911: Are you in position, M21?

M21: M14 and I are ready. We can punch our enemies full of holes anytime!

M1911: Good. Please keep an eye on M14. Tell her about the way you fight if you've got free time.

M21: No problem. Leave it to me!

M1911: Hmm. I know I can count on you.

M1911: I'll see you later.

M1911 terminates the call.

M14: What are we gonna do, M21?

M21: Just wait for the enemy forces to set foot in the trap.

M21: Then "bang, bang, bang" them all!

M14: We understand!

M21: Right, this is the first time you're fighting this way...so you can just be on standby next to me.

M21: If there are too many of them, help me with whatever I miss.

M14: Okay, we'll definitely do our job!

M21: By the way, I've been wondering about this for a while...

M14: What?

M21: Why do you address yourself as "we"?

M14: Well...we do it so that M14 never forgets about our old companions!

M21: Old companions?

M14: Yeah. It was a long time ago...

At that moment, Thompson's voice comes through the comm link with gunshots in the background.

Thompson: Save your chatting for later, ladies.

Thompson: If you want any extra bounty, get to work and pull your weight.

M21: Alright, here we go!

M21: Tell me the rest after the fight, M14.

...Several minutes later.

...

Combat over.

M14: Thompson! Thompson!

Thompson: Looks like you're still in one piece, M14.

M21: Of course she is. I'm with her.

M14: Look, Thompson, we didn't lose a single screw this time!

Thompson: Isn't that how it's supposed to be, M14?

Thompson: You were never meant to be a walking target on the field.

M14: Hmm, we understand... That's why we did as M1911 said and fired from the back.

M14: Were you satisfied with our performance?

Thompson: It's...acceptable. Nothing exceptional.

Thompson: Now let's not waste time and head for the next location.

...In a safe house somewhere.

Thompson: We're now in Phase 2.

Thompson: M14, you stay behind to guard this outpost. Everyone else, with me.

M14: Wait... You're not taking us with you?

Thompson: The operation will be rather risky from now on. You just switched positions so it's unwise to have you with us.

Thompson: We'll rendezvous after the battle.

M14: But...

Thompson: No buts. Squad leader's order.

M21: Don't worry, M14!

M21: We'll sort it out quickly and come back for you soon!

Thompson: Keep in touch.

Thompson: I'll call you over if we need help.

M14: Okay...

The rest of the squad leave the safe house.

M14 sits down against the wall of the building on her own.

M14: ...

M14: It's all the same...

M14: We still got left behind.

M14 curls into a ball and hugs her knees while she waits.

M14: I'm all alone.

M14: ...

M14: I hate how it feels...

M14: It's just like back then...

???: Don't give up. We will definitely pass the test!

???: Our numbers are dwindling...

???: Are we really a defective model?

???: As long as one of us passes the test...

???: All our hopes are on you...

M14!!

M14: ?!

A voice suddenly comes through the comm link. M14 jumps to her feet right away.

M14: We're here!

M14: Is this M21?! Is something wrong?

M21: Cough... M14, withdraw immediately!

M14: But our order is to...

M1911: M14, you must leave that safe house at once!

M1911: The enemy is much tougher than we imagined... A platoon we didn't manage to get is heading straight towards your location!

M9: Stop chatting! They're on us again!

M21: Alright, got it! I'll—

M21: M14, we're in a bit of a spot now, but we'll get you as soon as we can...

M14: (M21 seems to be in serious trouble...)

M14: Why don't we stay here and ambush them?!

M21: What?! Don't even think about it! Not funny at all!

M21: Just run! We'll do our best to catch up!

...Transmission terminated.

M14: Then we're leaving.

M14: But...if we go now...

M1911: Have you put in any effort for what you want?

M14: ...

If I go now, won't I be letting down my companions of old?

There once was a line of T-Doll that was put under hundreds and thousands of test during its development.

Countless units of the same model were screened out from during the testing process.

In the end, only a single unit passed all performance tests...

M14: The remaining unit...was me.

I survived all those tests. I am not defective.

Even I can fight... Even I can achieve victory for everyone!

This is all I want to prove!

If I give up now, their sacrifice would've been for nothing.

The T-Dolls retired in the lab...the ones that didn't pass the tests...

I am the only one who still remembers them.

If even I am retired, all memories of them will be gone.

M14: I...

M14: WE aren't defective, useless T-Dolls!

M14: We have to fight!

M14 connects to Thompson's communication channel.

M14: Thompson!

Thompson: M14? I don't have time...

Thompson: Wait, why are you still at the safe house?!

M14: Listen to us, Thompson!

M14: We have an idea...

...

I will go forward on their behalf. This is our wish.

I will never forget about this wish from now on.

I will remember our past and live on...

This is our fight.

I must work even harder for this goal.
Part 4

    4chevron_right

At the Griffin café.

M21: ...So that's your story.

M21: Earlier models really had it rough.

M14: But we were really happy!

M14: Thank you so much for listening to our story, M21.

M21: It's nothing. We're friends, after all.

M21: I'm glad to know you better.

M14: Hmm, we've finished our coffee.

M14: Time to rejoin the squad...

M21: You seem nervous?

M14: Yeah...

M14: It's been a while, and we look different now... We wonder how they'll see us.

M21: Don't worry. M14 is M14.

M21: Besides, you did us a huge favor on our last mission. Miss Thompson was all smiles.

M21: She arranged special training for you and even asked the Commander to file you in for a Neural Upgrade.

M21: M1911 never had anything against you. Even M9, fussy as she is, won't have a problem with you.

M14: Really?

M21: Really! I'm not joking this time.

M14: Th-that's a relief!

M21: Now let's go. They're in for a shock when they see how you've turned out.

In the dorm at the Griffin base.

M1911: Say...isn't it the last day of the special training that Thompson put M14 through?

M9: I think so... It's been more than a month. I wonder what M14's like after all that training.

M9: I sure hope she didn't turn into a Thompson 2.0!

M1911: If Thompson were here, you'd probably be full of holes by now.

M9: Humph...

M9: (Mutters) If Thompson ever finds out, some old granny must've snitched on me.

M1911: I heard that, M9.

M14: So you're here!

The two T-Dolls in the lounge turn simultaneously to the door.

M1911: Ah, you're back, M14.

M9: What...? Are you really M14?

M21: The one and only!

M14: It's been a while. We missed you!

M9: You look a lot cooler than before.

M9: Damn, can't believe I'm actually jealous...

M14: Heheh, all thanks to Thompson's special training!

M14: Oh, and Miss Kalin, who acquired a lot of new parts for us.

M14: We can easily take on hundreds of Sangvis now!

M1911: Haha, it's the same old M14, alright.

M1911: Now you don't have to worry, M9.

M9: ...I wasn't worried or anything!

M14: Don't worry. We'll definitely be of help from now on!

M9: I said I wasn't worried...whatever.

M1911: By the way... M14, that's not the first thing you should say when you see us.

M14: Huh? Then what should we say?

M9: Yep, she's still an idiot...

M9: Isn't it obvious that you should say something along the lines of "I'm back" when you get home?

M14: Oh... Then...we're back!

M14: From now on, we will fight side by side with you!
