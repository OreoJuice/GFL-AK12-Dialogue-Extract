In the Dolls' dormitory at the Griffin base.

Gr G36: ...So that was what happened during the previous operation. Human bodies are very fragile, so do pay attention to that when carrying out missions that involve protecting your target.

Tokarev: Which means we won't be able to charge with our target in tow during evacuation?

Gr G36: Absolutely not, that is way too risky.

Gr G36: If your target ends up getting injured, your entire mission will have been for naught.

P7: Seriously... Humans really could use some physical enhancement.

Gr G36: But that's just the way they are, and it is our duty to protect them.

Gr G36: Isn't it the same with the Commander?

StG44: You're not even part of this assignment, P7, so why are you complaining?

StG44: If you have so much free time for idle chatter, perhaps you should spend it at the training ground.

P7: I'm just listening in! There's no harm in sharing our experience with each other. Gr G36 and Tokarev clearly aren't bothered.

StG44: I don't mind people joining our conversation, as long as they don't drop empty seed husks everywhere...

P7: I only dropped like a couple, you hardly have to freak out about that!

P7: Besides, it's not like I'm not going to tidy up later...

Tokarev: Now stop arguing. Try to get along.

Tokarev: Thank goodness I had this chat with you, Gr G36, or I might really do something stupid on my mission...

Tokarev: (Sighs) But I'm still a bit worried... I'd feel a lot better if StG44 could come along.

StG44: Hm... I'd love to, but I'm not on the roster.

StG44: We all have our orders, so do your best, Tokarev.

Tokarev: True, I'm sure the Commander has a reason for this arrangement.

Tokarev: Thanks for the talk, now I'd better be off!

Gr G36: You're very welcome. If you have any more questions in the future, feel free to come to me.

P7: Right, I've got to get going too.

P7: Oh yeah, I need to tidy up...

StG44: Just leave that to me.

P7: You don't need any help?

StG44: Don't worry about it. It's just a quick sweep.

StG44: Having too many hands would only make it less efficient.

P7: Alright then, I suppose you haven't got much work to do anyway.

P7: I'm going. Bye~

StG44: ...

StG44: Yeah, see you.

Gr G36: In that case, I shall take my leave as well. Thank you for lending us your room, StG44.

StG44: ...Don't mention it. See you around.

StG44 sits down quietly in her room. As she watches the other Dolls depart one after the other, she unconsciously tightens her fists.

Gr G36: Are you alright?

StG44: Huh...?!

StG44: You're still here, Gr G36?

Gr G36: You seem troubled.

Gr G36: Is it because of the recent mission roster?

StG44: ...It's nothing, really. As Tokarev has said, the Commander must have a reason for this arrangement.

StG44: Um, do you mind sharing some of your chores with me today as well?

Gr G36: Of course not... These are the areas that need to be cleaned, if you'd please.

StG44: Got it. Thank you, Gr G36.

Gr G36: If it really troubles you so much, it might be a good idea to speak to the Commander directly.

StG44: ...Right.

StG44: Thank you, Gr G36, really.

Gr G36: (...She doesn't plan on going, does she.)

Gr G36: Then I'll leave you to it.

After seeing Gr G36 off, StG44 starts cleaning up the room.

(I've been the only one here at the dorm for days.)

(Gr G36 was right. Maybe I should really go talk to the Commander or Miss Kalina...)

(...But that would only take up their time.)

(The Commander is always right. The Commander has gone through hell and back with us. The Commander is in all my neural cloud memories.)

(If the Commander isn't putting me on the mission roster, there must be a reason.)

A reason that couldn't be said to my face but is enough for the Commander to withhold assignments from me...

...

StG44 stops in her tracks and stands rooted to the spot for a long while.

Have I...become utterly useless?

???: Haha, this can't be further from the truth!

???: If you start having such ideas, the Commander will never pay you any mind!

StG44: ...?!

StG44: Who's that...?

???: O lowly Tactical Doll, look up.

???: I don't blame you for not noticing my high and mighty existence.

StG44: ...

StG44 raises her head and looks toward the source of the voice...
Part 2

Guided by the strange voice, StG44 looks up and finally locates the voice.

StG44: ...Aren't you just an ordinary Shield Fairy?

???: Nuh-uh! You are terribly mistaken for taking me so lightly!

???: I am a noble angel speaking through the mechanical body of the Shield Fairy.

StG44: ...That sounds like a load of bull.

Angel?: I can see that you are unconvinced.

Angel?: However, angels can hear people's inner voices – I have been summoned by your muted cries for salvation.

StG44: Salvation?

Angel?: You long for someone to come and lift you out of your plight of not being of any use.

StG44: ...

Angel?: You do not wish to leave Griffin – you would like to make yourself useful for your friends and your leader.

Angel?: But in your current predicament, you are at a loss.

StG44: (How does this Fairy know so much...?)

Angel?: Humph, spot on, wasn't I?

Angel?: If you want a solution to your problem, beg me for it!

StG44: (Beg? That's a bit...)

Angel?: It really irks you to seek help from someone else, doesn't it?

Angel?: But you can't afford to hesitate.

Angel?: If you keep dawdling, your fire control core might very well be torn out tomorrow...

Angel?: If Griffin gives you the boot, I suppose a Doll like you would only be fit for washing dishes or mining coal... Oh dear, oh dear, how I pity you...

StG44: I...

StG44: What should I do...?

StG44: Please tell me, Angel! I beg you!

Angel: Haha... Now you know how to beg?

Angel: How innocent! How guileless! You really are the Doll chosen by this noble angel.

Angel: Then I'll give it to you straight. I know the thoughts of the human in this base. The reason why you have not been receiving any assignments is that...

As if to test StG44's patience, the angel deliberately draws out her sentence.

StG44 grows more tense by the second, waiting for the explanation with bated breath.

Angel: ...You're too disagreeable!

Angel: You keep to yourself, are reluctant to socialize with others, and are way too particular about your surroundings!

Angel: Dolls like you can't be grouped with other Dolls easily! Compared to you, that human has other better, more reliable pawns at their disposal!

StG44: No way... Is this really the reason...?

StG44: I have been wondering if I'm too fastidious, so it's true...

StG44: (Still, it's kind of hurtful to have that pointed out so directly.)

Angel: But don't despair, for I have come to answer your prayer!

Angel: As long as you follow my advice and overcome your shortcomings, you will once again become a capable and trustworthy aide in the human's eyes.

StG44: I'll do exactly as you say!

StG44: So please help me, Angel!

Meanwhile, in the command room.

Kalin: Goodness me... I've been so overwhelmed with work lately but I never thought I'd make such a terrible mistake...

Gr G36: What's the matter, Miss Kalina? Is there anything I can do to help...?

Kalin: Oh, Gr G36, you're right on time!

Kalin: The program we use to arrange the roster bugged out, and StG44 hasn't been given any assignments for over a week.

Kalin: If I hadn't spotted the error report just now, it would've gone on for even longer...

Gr G36: ...So that's the problem.

Kalin: Huh? Any thoughts, Gr G36?

Gr G36: StG44 has been rather blue due to the sudden lack of work.

Gr G36: Miss Kalina, do you mind taking the time to explain the situation to her?

Kalin: Oh...s-sure thing!

Kalin: Then I'd better go look for her right away.

Gr G36: She should be in her dorm at the moment.

Kalin: You've been a great help! Ciao, Gr G36!

A few minutes later, outside the dormitory.

Kalin: What? StG44 isn't at the dorm?

Kalin: But Gr G36 said she'd be doing some cleaning here.

P7: Nope. She ran off a short while ago! In...that direction.

Kalin: ...

Kalin: (Why would someone as dutiful as StG44 suddenly desert her post?)

Kalin: Are you sure you're not pulling my leg, P7? I have something very important to discuss with her.

P7: Why would I, Miss Kalina?! You said it's important, so I would never mess around in such a situation.

P7: Besides, how could a Doll as adorable as me be a liar?

Kalin: ...

P7: Ugh... That doubtful look is making me cry...

Kalin: Huh...?! No, I'm not doubting you, P7...

P7: Just kidding.

P7: But I was actually telling the truth. Go look for her over there!

Kalin: ...Alright. (But that would lead me...to the empty space behind the base.)

Kalin: (What could StG44 be doing all the way over there...?)

Kalin: (In any case, I'd better go and take a look.)
Part 3

On the empty field behind the base.

StG44: Oh, it rained yesterday. This place...is very muddy!

StG44: Should we go around, Angel?

Angel: ...

StG44: Angel?

Angel: ...

Angel: ...

Angel: NO GOING AROUND!

StG44: That...almost knocked out my hearing module...!

StG44: I thought you'd stopped possessing the Shield Fairy...

Angel: I was just doing some thinking!

Angel: Anyway, this is your training ground!

StG44: This...? But there's nothing here but mud...

Angel: That's precisely the point.

Angel: You must get over your clean freak tendencies.

StG44: Hold on, you don't expect me to...

Angel: Your Commander is too soft.

Angel: They have never sent you into battles where you have to get real dirty, have they?

Angel: But if you ever run into such conditions, wouldn't you be completely useless?

StG44: For the sake of my mission...of course I'd...

StG44: ...

StG44: If the Commander gives the order, I would do my best...

Angel: See? You just can't let go of your lady's dignity.

Angel: Is this the extent of your determination?

StG44: B-but...

StG44: This is hardly necessary, is it? Do I really have to do this?

Angel: Are you questioning your angel?

Angel: This is exactly why nobody wants to give you anything to do!

StG44: ...You're right...

StG44: But that's how I've been programmed, I can't help if...

StG44: My neural cloud is warning me against walking into the mud!

Angel: There are no chips in your shoes. You'll be fine.

StG44: I don't tend to worry about the cleanliness of my clothes on the battlefield...

StG44: But this is a bit too much...

Angel: You said it yourself - you'd do exactly as I say.

Angel: So why are you second-guessing me now?

Angel: Now step into the mud.

StG44: ...

Angel: No neural upgrade, terrible personality.

Angel: You want the Commander to appreciate you without making an effort to improve yourself? There is no such thing as a free lunch, you know?

Angel: Even this drone that I'm...possessing is more intricate and multi-functional than you.

StG44: (Neural upgrade? That's right, that's also a solution! If I can receive a neural upgrade, surely the Commander will dispatch me to the frontlines again?)

StG44: (...But I would be the last Doll to be given such a precious opportunity.)

StG44: (No, I'm already a burden. If I am to be of help to the Commander on the battlefield, if I want to fight next to the Commander...)

StG44: I understand. I have to change.

StG44: Please supervise my progress, Angel!

Angel: That's the spirit~

Angel: Then let's conquer the clean freak in you!

StG44: Roger that! StG44, commencing operation!

StG44: ...Eeeep!

Angel: Nope! Wrong shooting posture!

Angel: That won't do!

StG44: I'm so sorry, I'll try again... This mud...is getting in the way!

Angel: That's better! Forget about the mud! I'm watching you like a hawk! Don't slack!

StG44: Right, let's start over...!

...Meanwhile.

Kalin: She should be just about here...

Kalin: Oh, Commander?

Commander: I heard something strange over here.

Kalin: Strange?

Kalin: Oh, gunshots! Is it an enemy attack? That can't be, we're inside the base!

Kalin: Also...that sounds like a drone.

Commander: Let me take a look.

Kalin: ...Be careful, Commander.

Commander: I don't think we have to worry too much... More importantly, Kalina.

Commander: Do you remember the report about a missing drone?

Kalin: Oh, you mean...

Commander: Let's see for ourselves. I have no answers yet.

Kalin: By the way, Commander, there's another matter about StG44...

StG44: How was that shot?

Angel: Perfect! The way you look kneeling in all this sludge is hila...urk!

The voice gets cut off.

StG44 turns around, but the angel is nowhere to be found.

Instead, she finds the Commander and Kalina standing there, gaping at her.

...Oh, Commander.

Kalin: My god... StG44, what on earth happened to you?

Commander: StG44...
If choice 1 was picked

StG44: I'm very well, Commander!
If choice 1 was picked

Commander: You don't look well at all.
If choice 1 was picked

StG44: I...I'm fine, Commander, really! Please believe me!
If choice 2 was picked

StG44: An angel is guiding me...
If choice 2 was picked

Commander: Angel?
If choice 2 was picked

StG44: Uh...nothing.

StG44: I'm just doing some...field battle training here.

Commander: (She's a lousy liar. Still, if she doesn't want to talk about it, I'll just drop it.)

Commander: Alright, let's get to the point then.

Commander: StG44, I've been looking for you.

StG44: For me...?

StG44: Has there been a new arrangement? I will obey your orders.

StG44: (Even if the outcome is the one I dread so much.)

StG44: (O Angel, please watch over me.)

Commander: We've recently discovered a bug in the AI program that's in charge of organizing the roster. It seems to have overlooked you...

StG44: What?!

Commander: StG44? What's the matter?

StG44: S-sorry...

StG44: I was just a bit agitated... Thank you...

Commander: ...

Commander: StG44, your performance has always been exceptional. Not a single mistake.

StG44: Right...

Commander: So don't think yourself into a corner.

StG44: I understand, Commander...

StG44: Um...pardon my bad manners, but could you please avert your eyes for the time being?

StG44: In my present state...I find it very humiliating...

Commander: I get it.

Commander: Then we'll be going then. If anything happens, remember to report it.

StG44: Of course...

StG44: (Looks like I misunderstood the whole thing. What a relief.)

StG44: (But am I really content with the status quo?)

Angel: Overcome your shortcomings, and you will once again become a capable and trustworthy aide in the human's eyes.

StG44: (The Commander knows how I'm feeling.)

StG44: (It's always been like this... The Commander is always very mindful of the feelings of every single Doll and takes great care when dealing with us.)

StG44: (I must stop brushing off the Commander just because I feel embarrassed.)

StG44: (I mustn't let the Commander's tender concern go to waste.)

StG44: Excuse me, Commander!

Commander: ...Yes?

StG44: ...Th-there's something...I'd like to discuss with you.

StG44: I want to contribute more in our battles.

StG44: So...could you please grant me the opportunity of having a neural upgrade?
Part 4

In the base.

Tokarev: So yeah... We completed the mission, but it really was touch-and-go.

Gr G36: That was a bit negligent on your part.

Gr G36: Unlike Dolls, one careless mistake is all it takes to inflict fatal injuries on humans.

Tokarev: I will keep that in mind on similar missions in the future.

Tokarev: (Sighs) If I had StG44 with me, it would probably have gone a lot more smoothly...

Tokarev: So, I heard she's been given a new assignment?

Gr G36: That's right, a mission given by the Commander in person.

Gr G36: She should be returning...right about now.

The door opens not a second too soon.

StG44: I'm back!

Tokarev: Oh, welcome back!

Gr G36 only nods silently at StG44, who returns the gestures with a smile.

Tokarev: I heard you got a neural upgrade... But you don't look too different?

StG44: It does look pretty similar, but this uniform is brand new.

StG44: And my mission went very well!

Tokarev: I see. Then congratulations, StG44.

Tokarev: You look very cool in your new uniform.

StG44: Thanks! I asked the Commander, and I can report for duty and resume my daily duties right away.

StG44: So let's keep looking out for one another.

Tokarev: Certainly. Always happy to work with you.

StG44: I'm glad to hear it.

Tokarev: So what's the plan?

Tokarev: If you have some time, can we sit down for a chat? I'm quite curious about this neural upgrade...

StG44: Sure thing.

StG44: But I need to visit a place first. I'll be back in a second.

After bidding Tokarev a hasty farewell, StG44 exits the dorm and tiptoes down the corridor.

StG44: (It was around here...where I first met the angel.)

StG44: (If I could find her again...)

Tap.

Tap. Creak.

StG44: What's that noise? I can hear something from around the corner...

???: Heheh... I'm a noble angel!

???: You lowly Dolls...

StG44: Great, she's here!

Somewhat Familiar Voice: ...Ugh... That doesn't sound grandiose enough.

Somewhat Familiar Voice: I should phrase it differently...

StG44: ...

StG44 swiftly turns the corner.

In the storage closet, P7 is sitting with her back to the door and muttering to herself, an unidentifiable object on her lap.

P7: “Then I'll give you a taste of the power of Heaven!”

P7: That feels pretty good, then...

StG44: So should I call you Angel...or P7?

P7: ...Huh?

StG44: I knew the angel was fake, but I certainly didn't expect it to be you...

P7: I have no idea what you're on about.

P7: How dare you slander an adorable Doll...

StG44: What's that underneath your dress?

P7: Huh? Nothing whatsoever.

P7: Hey, don't go flipping up a girl's dress!

P7: Outrageous! Wicked! Hey!!

StG44: The Commander mentioned something about a missing drone.

StG44: This is the missing Shield Fairy, isn't it?

P7: ...Oh, fine. I'll admit it, okay?!

P7: I just wanted to prank you.

StG44: ...

P7: ...StG44?

StG44 continues to stare wordlessly at P7.

P7: Well, say something...

P7: ...Sorry if I've gone a bit too far...

StG44: In any case, the angel's advice did prove to be valuable.

StG44: Even if the Shield Fairy wasn't actually involved, I would still like to express my gratitude to you.

StG44: If it hadn't been for what you'd said, I would never have pulled myself together and worked to improve myself.

StG44: So thank you, P7.

P7: I just pulled a prank on you. It's kind of embarrassing now that you're thanking me so solemnly!

P7: Still, I suppose it doesn't matter...

StG44: ...But, a prank is still a prank.

StG44: I'm going to avenge myself, P7. Take this!

P7: ...Huh?! Hey, you were thanking me just a second ago?! No, wait! Stay back, StG44!

P7: Wait, don't pick me up by the collar! Where are you taking me?! Ahhhhhh!

StG44: You can't become a powerful angel without undergoing some difficult trials.

StG44: So, Noble Angel...

StG44: It's your turn to do some special training.
