December 1st, in the Griffin dorms.

GSh-18: It's here at last.

The chat window on the computer buzzes furiously, as though it is venting its anger.

Manga Editor: Why haven't you submitted your manuscript yet?!!!

GSh-18: I'm just going to pretend I'm working hard on the manuscript and didn't see this message, like last time.

Manga Editor: Are you pretending you didn't see this again?!

GSh-18: ...

Manga Editor: ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW!!!!!

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: I'm doing it, I'm doing it!

Manga Editor: Can't you be more like the author of "Is That Cute and Cool Angel Really My Commander" and not make me have to worry so much about you?

Manga Editor: You have three more days, I'll let you imagine what's going to happen if I don't get a submission by then.

The editor's icon goes gray.

GSh-18: Why do you keep comparing me to that shoujo manga artist? We're working on completely different genres...

GSh-18: Argh, only three days left... Looks like I need to decide on my theme by today!

GSh-18: In any case, it's got to be more entertaining than "Is That Cute and Cool Angel Really My Commander"...

GSh-18: I've used up all my notes from before and if I keep recycling old gags, the manga will become as stale as bubblegum you've chewed all day.

GSh-18: I need to collect new material, but I haven't had the chance to go on logistics recently...

GSh-18 steps out of the dorm and wanders aimlessly through the base.

At the café.

GSh-18: Ah, are you practicing how to brew English tea again, NTW?

NTW-20: !!!

Alarmed, NTW-20 picks up the tea set and swiftly leaves the scene.

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: I guess she's still bothered by what happened last time, huh...

GSh-18: But mixing mustard into the tea would have neutralized the spicy taste...right?

GSh-18 stealthily approaches PP-19-01 as the latter is focused on her book.

GSh-18: Huh? What are you reading now, PP-19-01?

GSh-18: An 1836 edition of Balzac's "Lily of the Valley"...

GSh-18: That looks pretty interesting, may I take a look?

PP-19-01: No! I spent a long time looking for this book...

PP-19-01: And I still remember how you doodled all over my book the last time, I haven't settled the score with you yet!

GSh-18: Oh, so that's the kind of book it is. I understand, keep reading, then.

GSh-18: I have things to do so I need to head off now.

PP-19-01: Hey! Get back here!

At the training ground.

GSh-18: Serdyukov! MP-443! Are you training?

GSh-18: I just picked up a really shiny rock, MP-443!

MP-443: What rock - mppphh!

Serdyukov: Shhhh—

Serdyukov: Have you forgotten what happened during our last training exercise, when you hit that Goliath with the rock you carved and we had to run for god knows how far?

Serdyukov: Have you forgotten how long we had to spend in the repair tanks?

MP-443 manages to shake her head vigorously despite the hand covering her mouth.

Serdyukov: Now do you remember who gave you that rock?

MP-443: ......

MP-443: ...What should we do, Serdyukov?

Serdyukov: ...GSh-18 with an impending deadline sighted, activating Class Two emergency plan - we retreat!

Serdyukov and MP-443 stealthily leave the training ground.

GSh-18: Huh? I thought I saw the two of them here just now?

Outside the forward basecamp.

GSh-18: ...Why is everyone avoiding me?

GSh-18: I was planning to manufacture some new material, but I guess that's not working out.

GSh-18: If only I could order everyone to obey my orders like in mangas...

GSh-18's gaze falls upon the real-time relay terminal.

GSh-18: Another batch of Dolls has gone out on expedition, unfortunately I'm not among the favored Dolls this week...

GSh-18: P7, AK-47, SPAS-12, FF FN49...

GSh-18: So we have a prankster, an drunkard, a glutton and a kitchen wench... That's a pretty interesting team composition!

GSh-18 pulls up a small stool and sits in front of the terminal.

Suddenly, a dialogue box appears on the screen.

Do you wish to decide their destiny?

A) Yes. B) No.

GSh-18: What kind of cringy nonsense is this? Deciding other people's destinies?

GSh-18: If people are going to do as I tell them, then I'll just give them half-assed orders...

GSh-18: Deciding the destiny of the characters in my own manga is hard enough, and now you want me to decide the destinies of people in real life...

GSh-18: Forget it...

GSh-18's finger hovers over Option B.

GSh-18: Then again, if I CAN decide their destinies, I might be able to make them do more interesting things...

GSh-18: Which means I might get more amusing material for my manga...

GSh-18's finger moves to Option A and presses down.
Part 2

December 1st. The expedition team discovers an abandoned wooden house.

AK-47: Yo! This looks like it hasn't been looted yet!

SPAS-12: I wonder if there's any food inside...

FF FN49: It would be nice if we could find the kind of chocolate FF FNC likes...

P7: Hehe, let the adventure begin~ ♪

SPAS-12 jumps for joy after finding a legendary, out-of-production can of beef inside the abandoned wooden house.

SPAS-12: Wowwww! They don't make cans of beef like this anymore!!! It smells great!!!

AK-47: Quick, give me some! Good stuff like that should go with vodka!

FF FN49: B-but...you refused my hardtack biscuits just now...

SPAS-12: Ahem...my motto is "never eat anything you don't like"!

GSh-18: Ah, the warm and comfy daily life on an expedition team. That suits the mood of my manga just fine.

GSh-18: But I've drawn this theme many times already and I've done all the gags which can be done...

GSh-18: I wonder if this expedition team will give me new inspiration...

P7: FF FN49, there's a pot and a stove here!

FF FN49 picks up a well-made steel pot and a usable stove.

After a long time...

She still hasn't given up on the idea of making a meal.

FF FN49: Um...could I cook here?

FF FN49: B-back when I cooked for Squad FN, they all said they liked my cooking...

SPAS-12: What can you make?

FF FN49: J-judging by the ingredients here, I could make some deep-fried skewers, I guess...

SPAS-12: Deep-fried...skewers?!

AK-47: Hahaha, skewers with vodka are heavenly!

P7: Let's just take a break here for now, we've walked a long way today, after all.

P7: Hehe, at last, it's time to prank someone!

GSh-18: That smile is pretty familiar... According to my past experiences, this is P7's classic expression when she's about to mess with someone.

GSh-18: Given the environment and her teammates, her most likely prank would be to...

GSh-18: Swap the chef's cooking wine and the drunkard's vodka, or swap the condiments for something super spicy...

A dialogue box suddenly appears on the screen.

Please select P7's pranks from the following -

A) Swap the vodka and the cooking wine. B) Sneak super-hot spices into the deep-fried skewers. C) All of the above.

GSh-18: Can I really decide their fate? No way...

GSh-18: How could real life offer such a manga-like feature?

GSh-18: Hmm... Let's try "all of the above".

GSh-18 picks Option C.

P7 takes advantage of everyone's lack of attention to switch FF FN49's cooking wine with AK-47's vodka, and then she pours the sachet of red powder she's brought along into the ingredients.

P7: Heehee, now who's going to fall for it first?

A dialog box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the victim of P7's pranks from the following -

A) FF FN49. B) AK-47. C) SPAS-12.

GSh-18: Normally it would be the big eaters who get it first, right?

GSh-18 picks Option C.

SPAS-12 eagerly picks up a cooked skewer.

SPAS-12: (Coughs) This taste...

SPAS-12: The double heat of vodka and red-hot chilli peppers...

SPAS-12: It's punching straight through my neural cloud...

FF FN49: Huh...but I didn't put in peppers or vodka, did I?

FF FN49: I-I definitely used my own cooking wine and spices...

AK-47: Hey, who switched my vodka?

AK-47: Don't think you can get away with touching my booze!

FF FN49: It-it wasn't me...

SPAS-12: Wasn't...(pants)...me either...

P7: It wasn't me!

AK-47: When it happened, FF FN49 was cooking and SPAS-12 was busy drooling next to her. You're the only one who had the time for this kind of nonsense.

P7: I didn't... How could I do something as stupid as pouring vodka into the cooking wine bottle?

AK-47: ...

P7: ...

GSh-18: From all of P7's previous antics, every time she gets caught, she'll give up and try to duck out by acting cute.

GSh-18: But this time, she is bound to suffer brutal punishment for the audacity of touching AK-47's vodka.

GSh-18: As for the form of punishment? She's probably going to get booze or something spicy shoved down her throat. You know, the old trope of letting the punishment fit the crime...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the punishment which AK-47 will administer -

A) Force her to drink vodka. B) Force her to eat something spicy. C: All of the above.

GSh-18 selects Option C.

AK-47: So it WAS you! You can save your excuses! Open up—

P7: Ahhhhhhh—

SPAS-12: (Pants) Come, I'll give you a nice ripe piece of fermented tofu...

P7: (Gags)... Nooo...

AK-47: Can't swallow? Then have some authentic vodka to wash it down!

P7: %*￥@%#*......

GSh-18: It went exactly according to my choice... Am I really the God of this world?

GSh-18 looks down at the manga she's drawn so far and shakes her head in dissatisfaction.

GSh-18: But my readers will probably mock me to death if I draw a boring daily routine like this...

GSh-18: Ahh, it can't be helped, let's try and put more stuff together...

Several hours later.

FF FN49: Weather like this is great for hotpot... Too bad I've used up most of the ingredients on the deep-fried skewers.

FF FN49: When I get back, I'll make sure that I have hotpot with everyone else from Squad FN!

P7: This white snowy mountain makes me think of strawberry ice-cream...

P7: When I get back, I'm going to eat my fill at the café!

SPAS-12: Ah, it's a mountain of ice cream...

SPAS-12: If only I could bring half of it back to the Commander...

AK-47: What's so good about ice cream? Taking a piece of old ice, cutting it down into a ball and dunking it into vodka, now THAT'S a treat!

FF FN49: But...we still have a long way to go...

SPAS-12: Yeah...

P7: Expeditions are tiring...

AK-47: Actually, I know a shortcut...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the route which the expedition will follow from the following options -

A) Stick to the prescribed route. B) Take AK-47's shortcut.

GSh-18: If they stick to the prescribed route, I bet nothing interesting will happen...

GSh-18: The shortcut might end up giving me inspiration...

GSh-18 presses Option B.

FF FN49: Erm... Miss Kalina said that...we have to stick closely to the route for this expedition...

AK-47: If we take the route they gave us, we'll have to make a big detour! We could be back at the base by then!

SPAS-12: If I have to choose between being able to eat ice cream sooner and sticking to the route...

SPAS-12: Then I pick eating ice cream sooner!

P7: I want strawberry ice cream!

FF FN49: But...

AK-47: Relax! We'll make it safely back to base for sure!

AK-47 claps FF FN49 roughly on her back.

The expedition team slowly approaches the center of the frozen lake.

SPAS-12: ...FF FN49, do you still have potato chips with you?

FF FN49: I'm out...but I still have those hardtack biscuits...

SPAS-12: Thank you, but if it's hardtack, I'll pass...

P7: I've got fruit gummies, you can have some!

SPAS-12: You tried that one on me before, P7...

AK-47: Getting tired already? I still have some vodka here.

SPAS-12: No thanks! I don't—

Splash—

Something falls into the water.

AK-47: You don't what?

AK-47: Huh? Where's SPAS?

FF FN49: ...Where did SPAS go? She just vanished!

P7: How did you do it? Teach me, SPAS!

AK-47: The ice here is broken... It's SPAS—!

AK-47: She's in the lake! Bozhe moi, the water's carrying her that way!

FF FN49: I...I think I'm going to faint...

P7: We need to go after her!

AK-47: SPAS—!

All they can see through a layer of murky ice is SPAS-12 being carried to parts unknown by the undertow.

They run frantically, they pant heavily, and as they do, the ice behind them begins to crack quietly.

GSh-18: Wait a minute, isn't this a light-hearted slice of life manga? What the hell's with this development?

GSh-18: A sudden mood shift like this makes no sense!

GSh-18: The author's neural cloud ought to be reformatted...

GSh-18: Wait a minute, I'm the one who has a say over where this is going...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the course of action which the other expedition team members will follow -

A) Keep on SPAS' trail and rescue her. B) Move calmly and abandon SPAS-12.

GSh-18: How the hell could they abandon her?!

GSh-18: Aren't friends the sort of people you need to protect in times of danger?!

GSh-18 presses Option A without any hesitation.

AK-47: SPAS—! Stop moving! Please stop!

FF FN49: Wait for us... Miss AK-47...

P7: I can't keep up... You guys are too fast...

FF FN49: Miss P7, I'll pull you along...

FF FN49: Miss P7?

FF FN49 jerks her head back, but all she can see is ice.

FF FN49: P-please don't scare me... Miss P7?

FF FN49: That's enough, Miss P7, stop playing around... Please come out...

FF FN49's quavering voice is drowned out by the sound of the ice splitting open.

FF FN49: Miss AK-47... Miss P7's gone!

FF FN49: ...Miss AK-47?

FF FN49 looks in AK-47's direction. Cracks have suddenly appeared on the smooth surface of the ice, and a golden mass of seaweed flows beneath the cracks into the distance...

FF FN49: Miss AK-47—!!!

GSh-18: ...How did things end up like this?

GSh-18: I made every choice for them...

GSh-18: Could it be my fault...? Did I do this to them?

GSh-18: I can't believed I turned a warm and comfy slice of life manga into this for the sake of gags and entertainment...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

BAD END.

Do you wish to start over from the beginning? Note - starting again will expend a page of manga sketches.

A) Start again. B) Continue.

GSh-18: Do you even have to ask? Of course I choose...

GSh-18 looks at the thick manuscript in her hands.

GSh-18: TO START AGAIN!!!

GSh-18 savagely presses Option A.
Part 3

GSh-18 jumps up from her chair with a shout.

GSh-18: Aaaaahhhhhhh—

GSh-18: Wait, what...am I doing here?

The chat window on the computer buzzes furiously, as though it is venting its anger.

Manga Editor: Why haven't you submitted your manuscript yet!!!

Manga Editor: Are you pretending you didn't see this again!?

Manga Editor: ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW!!!!!

GSh-18: Wait a minute... What time is it?

Computer Assistant: The time now is 0700, December 1st. Your manuscript submission deadline has been delayed to December 3rd.

GSh-18: How did this happen? I remember it was night-time...

GSh-18 opens her sketchbook. The date reads November.

GSh-18: Did I...travel back in time?

Computer Assistant: Darling, I think you've accumulated too much stress from extended manga drawing. I recommend you perform several sets of push-ups...

GSh-18 ignores the prompt and runs straight to the forward basecamp.

The real-time relay terminal's screen displays the familiar forms of AK-47, P7, FF FN49, and SPAS-12.

FF FN49: J-judging by the ingredients here, I could make some deep-fried skewers, I guess...

SPAS-12: Deep-fried...skewers?!

AK-47: Hahaha, skewers with vodka are heavenly!

P7: Let's just take a break here for now, we've walked a long way today, after all.

P7: Hehe, at last, it's time to prank someone!

A dialogue box suddenly appears on the screen.

Please select P7's pranks from the following -

A) Swap the vodka and the cooking wine. B) Sneak super-hot spices into the deep-fried skewers. C) All of the above.

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: So I DID start all over again...

GSh-18: Thank goodness, I can get a happy ending now.

GSh-18: Surely an ordinary choice like this won't affect the ending, right?

GSh-18: It should be okay as long as I don't mess up at a key moment...

GSh-18 presses Option B.

P7 takes advantage of everyone's lack of attention to pour the sachet of red powder she's brought along into the ingredients.

P7: Heehee, now who's going to fall for it first?

A dialog box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the victim of P7's pranks from the following -

A) FF FN49. B) AK-47. C) SPAS-12.

GSh-18: No matter how you look at it, it's got to be SPAS...

GSh-18 picks Option C.

SPAS-12 eagerly picks up a cooked skewer.

SPAS-12: (Coughs) This taste...

SPAS-12: This burning chili spirit...

SPAS-12: It's punching straight through my neural cloud...

FF FN49: Huh...but I didn't put chili in... What's going on?

AK-47: P7 was obviously up to something.

P7: I didn't! I've been helping FF FN49 cook all this time.

P7: Isn't that right?

FF FN49: Er...y-yes...

SPAS-12: In any case...(pants)

SPAS-12: Get me...some milk...

GSh-18: The script has changed...

GSh-18: Although I'm not sure if it'll affect things further down the road, at least I can now be sure that I can change the plot development.

Several hours later.

FF FN49: But...we still have a long way to go...

SPAS-12: Yeah...

P7: Expeditions are tiring...

AK-47: Actually, I know a shortcut...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the route which the expedition will follow from the following options -

A) Stick to the prescribed route. B) Take AK-47's shortcut.

GSh-18: This is it! This is the choice!

GSh-18: If I just pick A here, the following disaster won't happen!

GSh-18 immediately presses A.

FF FN49: But...Miss Kalina told us to stick closely to the route for this expedition...

FF FN49: Apparently a previous expedition team strayed from the path and terrible things happened to them...

SPAS-12: Yeah, I think I heard about that too.

P7: Let's not do anything which would scare FF FN49.

AK-47: Alright then.

AK-47 shrugs nonchalantly, then takes out a vodka bottle from her pocket and knocks back a few mouthfuls.

GSh-18: Wait a minute, did AK-47 take a swig before at this point?

GSh-18: If I remember correctly, I don't think she did? So ever since...

GSh-18: P7 switched the cooking wine and the vodka...AK-47 hadn't drunk again...

GSh-18: Could it be that P7's prank was also a key choice?

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

There is an upcoming quick-time event. Please press the appropriate button in time. Failing more than three times will result in mission failure.

The quick-time event will begin in 3, 2, 1...

GSh-18: Hey, wait a minute! What the hell is this now?

GSh-18: This didn't show up before...

The A Button appears in the center of the screen, and it quickly vanishes after 2 seconds.

A new notification appears on the upper left corner of the screen.

Failure count - 1.

GSh-18: No...wait...

AK-47 empties the vodka bottle and follows her teammates away from the frozen lake.

In high spirits from her drink, she prances around and sings gleefully.

P7: What are you doing, AK-47?

FF FN49: Miss AK-47, the ground here is slippery, please be careful...

Before she can finish, AK-47 slips and slides down the slope onto the frozen lake.

GSh-18: So they're using quick-time events to control the plot now?! God dammit...

The B button appears in the middle of the screen, and GSh-18 immediately hits it.

GSh-18: Whew... Fail three times? Not on my watch...

An E button appears on the screen, but before GSh-18 can press it, a Q button appears as well.

GSh-18: It's speeding up! I can only press one...

GSh-18: If I miss another one...

More buttons appear on the screen in rapid succession, and they vanish before GSh-18 can decide which one to press.

GSh-18: No...

SPAS-12: Hang on to me and climb back up, AK-47.

AK-47: It's a frozen lake! I haven't gone skating with my friends in so long...

AK-47 ignores the hand SPAS is extending to her and skates to the center of the lake by herself.

P7: Hey! It's dangerous!

FF FN49: Miss AK-47...wait for us!

...

GSh-18 can only watch as the expedition team vanishes below the ice once more...

GSh-18: ...Dammit! I'll be back!

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

BAD END.

Do you wish to start over from the beginning? Note - starting again will expend a page of manga sketches.

A) Start again. B) Continue.

GSh-18 savagely presses Option A.

GSh-18 jumps up from her chair with a shout.

GSh-18: Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!

GSh-18: I have to succeed this time...

GSh-18: Whether it's saving the expedition team or handing in my submission before the deadline!

...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

There is an upcoming quick-time event. Please press the appropriate button in time. Failing more than three times will result in mission failure.

The quick-time event will begin in 3, 2, 1...

GSh-18: This again? Looks like I can't skip this event no matter what...

GSh-18: Time to get serious, my hands are pretty damn fast, you know!

One minute later.

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

BAD END.

Do you wish to start over from the beginning? Note - starting again will expend a page of manga sketches.

A) Start again. B) Continue.

GSh-18: Dammit! Again!

GSh-18 jumps up from her chair with a shout.

GSh-18: Wait for me... I'll save you...

...

BAD END.

Do you wish to start over from the beginning? Note - starting again will expend a page of manga sketches.

A) Start again. B) Continue.

GSh-18: I can't pass this quick-time event no matter what, is that it?!

......

BAD END.

BAD END.

BAD END.

...

GSh-18's sketchbook is almost empty.

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: Am I STILL not fast enough for this?!

GSh-18: Wait a minute, I've got an idea...
Part 4

    4chevron_right

At the forward basecamp.

GSh-18: I'm here!!! This time, I'll definitely make it!!!

FF FN49: J-judging by the ingredients here, I could make some deep-fried skewers, I guess...

SPAS-12: Deep-fried...skewers?!

AK-47: Hahaha, skewers with vodka are heavenly!

P7: Let's just take a break here for now, we've walked a long way today, after all.

P7: Hehe, at last, it's time to prank someone!

A dialogue box suddenly appears on the screen.

Please select P7's pranks from the following -

A) Swap the vodka and the cooking wine. B) Sneak super-hot spices into the deep-fried skewers. C) All of the above.

P7 takes advantage of everyone's lack of attention to switch FF FN49's cooking wine with AK-47's vodka, and then she pours the sachet of red powder she's brought along into the ingredients.

P7: Heehee, now who's going to fall for it first?

A dialog box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the victim of P7's pranks from the following -

A) FF FN49. B) AK-47. C) SPAS-12.

GSh-18 picks Option B.

AK-47 eagerly picks up a cooked skewer.

AK-47: This taste... Who switched my vodka?!

AK-47: Don't think you can get away with touching my booze!

FF FN49: It, it wasn't me...

SPAS-12: Wasn't...(pants)...me either...

P7: It-it wasn't me...

AK-47: When it happened, FF FN49 was cooking and SPAS-12 was busy drooling next to her. You're the only one who had the time for this kind of nonsense.

P7: I didn't... How could I do something as stupid as pouring vodka into the cooking wine bottle?

AK-47: ...

P7: ...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the punishment which AK-47 will administer -

A) Force her to drink vodka. B) Force her to eat something spicy. C: All of the above.

GSh-18 selects Option A.

AK-47: So it WAS you! You can save your excuses! Open up—

P7: Ahhhhhhh—

AK-47: Feel the wrath of vodka!

P7: %*￥@%#*...

Several hours later.

FF FN49: But...we still have a long way to go...

SPAS-12: Yeah...

P7: Expeditions are tiring...

AK-47: Actually, I know of a shortcut...

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

Please select the route which the expedition will follow from the following options -

A) Stick to the prescribed route. B) Take AK-47's shortcut.

GSh-18 picks Option A.

FF FN49: But...Miss Kalina told us to stick closely to the route for this expedition...

SPAS-12: Yeah, I think I heard about that too.

P7: Let's not do anything which would scare FF FN49.

AK-47 shrugs nonchalantly, then prepares to leave the frozen lake.

A dialogue box appears on the terminal screen.

There is an upcoming quick-time event. Please press the appropriate button in time. Failing more than three times will result in mission failure.

The quick-time event will begin in 3, 2, 1...

GSh-18: Here it is at last, the emergency modifications I asked QJY-88 to make are about to see use!

GSh-18: It's an overall upgrade of speed and dexterity in both hands, and I can even get perfect scores on Master-difficulty songs!

GSh-18: Finally, I can bring you home...

GSh-18: And I've got new inspiration for my manga...

An A button appears in the middle of the screen. GSh-18 quickly presses it.

GSh-18: Even I could handle the Easy difficulty before my modifications.

GSh-18 smiles as she continues pressing the lettered buttons which show up with one hand.

An E button appears on the screen, and before the E button can disappear, a Q button appears as well.

GSh-18: So the speed's gone up to Normal level? Looks like I'll need to use both hands.

GSh-18 presses the buttons with ease, with her other hand helping from time to time.

Several buttons appear on the screen at once, but GSh-18 responds to them in time and hits them all.

GSh-18: So it skipped past Hard difficulty and went straight to Expert?

GSh-18: Humph, I'm an agile close-combat Doll, surely you're making light of me!

The quick-time event speeds up, as though in response to GSh-18's provocation.

GSh-18: So we're on Master difficulty now, huh... This is the difficulty that suits me!

GSh-18's arms move at high speed, stirring up the air and messing up the hair of the passing Dolls.

Kalina: GSh-18! What are you doing to my screen?!

At this moment, GSh-18's world is consumed by the buttons that rapidly appear before her. She can't hear the outside world at all.

GSh-18: My manga...

GSh-18: ...must have...the best ending...

Two buttons appear on the opposite ends of the screen. Just as GSh-18 strives to reach out and press them, a new button appears in the middle of the screen.

GSh-18: I knew this was coming... How lame...

GSh-18: People have been drawing stunts like this for hundreds of years!!!

GSh-18 bashes her head into the screen without any hesitation.

Ping—

The quick-time event vanishes.

Something appears on the screen that GSh-18 has never seen before.

CONGRATULATIONS!

And on the screen, the expedition team slowly proceeds along the road back to the base.

GSh-18: Thank goodness... This is the ending I wanted...

Kalina: GSh-18!!!

GSh-18 collapses to the ground.

GSh-18 jumps up from her chair with a shout.

GSh-18: What time is it? What happened to the expedition team?

Computer Assistant: The time now is 0834, December 2nd. The expedition team has returned safely.

GSh-18: Whew— Thank goodness, I made it...

Computer Assistant: While you were sleeping, you received 12 emails from Miss Kalina and the editor.

Computer Assistant: Miss Kalina wants you to get back to the Factory ASAP once you wake up.

Computer Assistant: The other 11 are emails from the editor asking about your submission.

GSh-18: ...While I was sleeping? Wait a minute, I remember I was watching the daily life of the expedition team. How did I get back here?

Computer Assistant: Yesterday, Miss Kalina brought you back while you were asleep.

Computer Assistant: Miss Kalina said you had dozed off while you were watching the activities of the expedition team and told me not to wake you up.

Computer Assistant: You have spent a total of—

GSh-18: Say WHAT!? I was asleep...so everything that happened yesterday was a dream?

GSh-18: ...Where's the manga sketchbook I brought back with me yesterday?

Computer Assistant: The book you brought back is blank.

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: I must have left traces behind on the monitor at the forward basecamp!

GSh-18: Miss Kalina saw it back then...

GSh-18: Miss Kalina!

Kalina: What's the matter, GSh-18?

GSh-18: Miss Kalina...what happened when I was at the forward basecamp yesterday?

Kalina: Hahaha, perhaps the daily life of the expedition team was too boring, because you actually fell asleep.

GSh-18: ...

GSh-18: Was it really all a dream?

Kalina: It seems you had a really exciting dream?

GSh-18: It's nothing...

GSh-18: Thanks for sending me back to my dorm, Miss Kalina...

GSh-18: I'm hanging up.

GSh-18 suddenly looks at her blank sketchbook.

Computer Assistant: As a gentle reminder, you don't have much time left...

GSh-18: Ahhhhhhhhh— I got it already!!!!

GSh-18 weeps as she takes up her pen.

THE END.

On the night of December 1st.

Kalina: GSh-18!!!

GSh-18 collapses to the ground.

Kalina scoops up GSh-18, who is scalding hot, in her arms and carries her to the Factory.

QJY-88: I guess these temporary modifications are defective...

Kalina: Why did GSh-18 suddenly ask you to make temporary mods?

QJY-88: I didn't quite understand what she was saying either.

QJY-88: All I know is that it was an emergency and she swore she was going to save the expedition team or something?

QJY-88: She said she'd failed many times, and that she had to succeed this time...

Kalina: ...

Kalina: Did she blur the line between manga and reality?

QJY-88: She must have been under a lot of pressure to turn in a manuscript...

Kalina: We'll let her rest after taking off the temporary mods, as though it were a dream...

Kalina: When she wakes up, we'll give her a proper upgrade and improve her neural cloud's stability.

Kalina: Remember, you have to keep this a secret too...

QJY-88: Okay...

GSh-18 sleeps soundly in the repair tank, muttering to herself from time to time.
