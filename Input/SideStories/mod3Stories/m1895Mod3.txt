In the Griffin dorms.

M1895: Whew... Alright, done with maintenance! I'm in pretty good shape today~

M1895: Let's go relax in the cafe for a bit.

In the Griffin Cafe.

M1895: Is that... Mosin-Nagant over there?

Mosin-Nagant: Good afternoon, M1895~

M1895: What are you doing here?

M1895: According to the schedule, shouldn't you be in training right now?

Mosin-Nagant: Didn't you know? There were new arrivals to base yesterday.

Mosin-Nagant: The Commander rearranged the training schedule, so my allotted time slot has been pushed all the way back till tonight.

M1895: Oh? We have new recruits?

M1895: Do you know who and how many of them there are, Mosin-Nagant?

Mosin-Nagant: They should be Handgun Dolls like you.

Mosin-Nagant: I think there were three... no, two of them?

M1895: ...Honestly, it's one thing not to know their names, but you don't even know how many there are?

Mosin-Nagant: Well, it's not like they're in our team... so I didn't really pay too much attention...

Mosin-Nagant: Besides, we'll go on missions together eventually, we'll get to know each other when that comes around!

M1895: Mosin-Nagant, as their seniors, we ought to take better care of our rookies!

M1895: Part of a veteran's responsibilities is passing on their experience.

Mosin-Nagant: Yes, certainly... but it's break time now.

Mosin-Nagant: Want a drink, M1895?

M1895: Nah, I'm going to eye over our new recruits.

M1895: I'm sure they'll need a lot of help, this being their first time here and all.

Mosin-Nagant: Every bit the worrywart as always... In that case, I guess I'll just have to cheer you on~

Inside the Griffin training ground.

M1895: Those two Dolls over there look like new faces...

M1895: Hello!

P99: Excuse me, you are...?

M1895: I'm M1895, one of the base's veterans.

M1895: Are you girls new?

P99: Ah, so you're our senior.

P99: Hello, I'm P99.

P99: I just arrived at this base yesterday, so I'll be in your care.

P38: I'm P38, who came with her~

P38: I'll be this base's future idol, so please root for me!

M1895: I-Idol?

M1895: What's that?

P38: Huh? You don't know what an idol is?

P38: It's a big, bright shining star with lots of fans~

M1895: ...Rookie, the battlefield isn't a place for you to hold concerts.

P99: Please don't mind her.

P99: Was there a reason why you've come looking for us, senior?

M1895: Ahem, it wasn't anything important.

M1895: I simply felt that I ought to give you rookies some advice, being a veteran and all.

P99: Advice, hm...

P99: So, what suggestions do you have for us, then?

M1895: Since we're Tactical Dolls, let's talk tactics.

M1895: These are the five tactical principles of M1895!

M1895: Number 1 - Obey your superiors' orders without question!

M1895: Number 2 - Carry yourself properly at all times!

M1895: Number 3 - When opening fire, do so as one!

M1895: Number 4 - Face the enemy head on!

M1895: Number 5 - Make sure you look cool in battle!

P99: ...

P38: ...

M1895: Why did you guys go quiet all of a sudden...

M1895: Don't tell me all that experience was too much to digest in one sitting?

P99: ...It doesn't seem very digestible at all.

M1895: ...What?

P99: Senior, as rookies, we're always eager to learn from the experiences of those who came before us...

P99: But if I may speak so plainly, the suggestions you just gave us are outdated and not applicable to modern battlefields.

P38: This goes beyond being non-applicable...

P38: The way you cling to such antique doctrines, you would have died on the battlefield long ago if you weren't a Tactical Doll, isn't that right?

M1895: Y-You... how dare you!

M1895: Looks like the newbies are going to get uppity if I don't show my stuff!

P38: You're on!

P38: Someone obsolete like you will never become the idol of the new age!

M1895: Alright, but don't go crying to the Commander when I beat you!

P99: ...What am I going to do with you.

P99: Senior, P38, calm down.

P99: If you're going to compete with each other, you should remember not to go too far.

...Two hours later.

M1895 and P38's simulated battle is over.

P38: So much for being a veteran, it certainly didn't feel like it at all.

M1895: Dammit... you actually attacked my resupply points and got me from behind!

M1895: If you've got the guts, come face me in a showdown!

P38: Firing in ranks is out of style nowadays, grandma.

P38: Only a winner can become a true idol!

M1895: That's not true...

M1895: There's no way my experience could be wrong, there must be some other reason...

P99: A single simulated battle doesn't explain much.

P99: Still, you should try new ways of fighting, senior. You might gain from it.

M1895: ...

P38: There's no point telling a stubborn old hag all that, P99.

P38: I'm tired from grappling with her for so long... Let's get something to eat!

P99: ...Might as well.

P99: Excuse us, senior. We'll be taking our leave.

P99 and P38 leave the training facility.

M1895: Why did I lose...

M1895: Yeah, it must be because now, the rookies are all taller than me!

M1895: They're taller and have superior firepower, while I'm still short and petite...

M1895: Everything will be alright once I grow taller!

M1895: Alright, you old gal! Get a hold on yourself!

M1895: I mustn't let the rookies look down on me!

M1895: From today onwards, my goal will be to do my best to grow taller and stronger!

In the cafeteria.

Mosin-Nagant: Is that... a carton of milk?

Mosin-Nagant: That's strange, who here in our dorm even drinks milk...

M1895: Good morning, Mosin-Nagant!

M1895: Wait, I haven't finished that carton you're holding, don't toss it!

Mosin-Nagant: I wasn't going to throw it away...

Mosin-Nagant: But I didn't expect you of all people to be drinking milk.

M1895: They say drinking milk helps you grow taller!

Mosin-Nagant: Did I hear that right... M1895, did you of all people actually say that?!

Mosin-Nagant: Didn't you not believe in such things?

M1895: Hahaha... I was just giving it a try.

Mosin-Nagant: ...How very suspicious.

Mosin-Nagant: There's been something off with you recently.

M1895: R-Really?

Mosin-Nagant: You've started drinking milk, you've been walking on your tiptoes, and you keep trying to touch the door beams...

Mosin-Nagant: This isn't like you at all.

Mosin-Nagant: Did something happen?

M1895: ...I just want to get taller!

Mosin-Nagant: Why are you suddenly so bothered by your height?

M1895: It's been bothering me all this time, okay?

Mosin-Nagant: But you never did anything weird like this before.

Mosin-Nagant: ....Perhaps, did something happen that made you mindful of your height?

M1895: It's nothing...

Mosin-Nagant: I can tell that it's not nothing, so don't try to hide it from me.

Mosin-Nagant: Why not tell me about it?

M1895: (Sighs) It's a little embarrassing to actually say it out loud.

Mosin-Nagant: How is telling your big sister about your difficulties embarrassing?

M1895: Alright, then...

M1895: But don't laugh when you hear it!

...M1895 tells the story of her battle simulation with P38.

Mosin-Nagant: I see...

M1895: You're laughing, right? You just laughed!

M1895: You said you wouldn't laugh!

Mosin-Nagant: Fine, fine. I won't laugh at you.

Mosin-Nagant: So that means you want to get taller to beat the rookies, then?

M1895: Yes! That girl who calls herself an idol actually dared to call me a stubborn old hag...

M1895: And that quiet-looking Doll's words were barbed as well!

M1895: Newbies these days... None of them know how to respect an old soldier!

Mosin-Nagant: Well, they ARE new, after all. We're above losing our temper with children, aren't we?

M1895: ...But it's still hard to bear.

M1895: Seeing our hard-earned experience being rejected just like that...

M1895: No, I have to prove I'm right!

M1895: Once I get taller, I'll make them look at me in a different light!

Mosin-Nagant: It's good that you're so motivated...

Mosin-Nagant: But the newcomers have their own ways of thinking too...

Mosin-Nagant: Perhaps the reason why you can't beat them isn't because of your height.

M1895: Don't tell me you agree with them about how we veterans are obsolete too?

Mosin-Nagant: No, that's not what I meant.

Mosin-Nagant: I feel that when it comes to tactics... Perhaps we elders should learn to be more flexible.

M1895: ...So even you think that way, Mosin-Nagant!

M1895: Forget it, I'll deal with this myself.

M1895 snatches the carton of milk from Mosin-Nagant's hand before turning and striding off.

Mosin-Nagant: (Sighs) That girl's gotten carried away again.

Mosin-Nagant: ...Perhaps a little setback might be a good thing for her.
Part 3

In the Griffin dorms.

M1895: My partners for today's mission are those two newcomers...

M1895: Honestly, who arranged this anyway...

...

M1895 thinks quietly for a while, and then removes her hat.

M1895: After all that training, I should have grown by quite a bit.

M1895: I don't need this hat any more...

M1895: I'll show them my true strength today!

...During the mission.

P99: We've spotted the S.F. comms post.

P99: Once we take it, our objectives for the first phase will be complete.

M1895: Alright then, I'll lead the attack.

M1895: This is a good range for a charge; let's get started!

P99: ...

P38: ...

M1895: What's with you?

P38: I don't mind if you want to commit suicide, but please do it by yourself.

P99: We're all armed with handguns. We don't stand much of a chance if we charge in recklessly.

P99: We'll take massive damage even if we manage to take the post... so a full-frontal attack is not suitable for us.

P38: That's common sense. Didn't you know that, oh dear senior of ours?

M1895: Eh...

P99: Right, that's enough. I'll take charge of this operation.

P99: Everyone, please act as I direct.

...Ten minutes later.

P38: All enemies on the perimeter have been wiped out.

P38: The enemies inside the comms post shouldn't have noticed us.

M1895: (The operation's gone very smoothly...)

M1895: (Looks like their way of fighting is better suited to modern warfare.)

P99: Very good, let's keep up the pace.

P99: ...Prep your flashbangs, we're going for a dynamic entry.

M1895: Oh, oh! An assault, then?

P99: This should be your forte, senior.

P99: Please eliminate all the enemies within the comms post as quickly as possible.

M1895: Leave it to me!

M1895: (I won't miss this chance to show my strength!)

...

...After the battle.

P99: This mission went well. Thank you for your cooperation, everyone.

P38: Hehe, the base's idol ought to be able to achieve this much!

M1895: ...

P99: What's wrong, senior?

P99: It's time to savor our victory.

M1895: This operation has made me look at you in a new light.

M1895: Your new ways of doing things are very practical indeed...

P99: Thank you. Gaining your approval pleases me as well, senior.

M1895: So... would you mind telling me more about them after we go back?

M1895: Even an old dog should still be able to learn new tricks from time to time.

P38: Oho? The antique's managed to see reason at last?

P99: ...Please don't mind her, senior.

P99: I would be glad to share what I know with you.

M1895: Relax, I won't split hairs with a kid.

M1895: It's a deal then. Let's pick a good time to chat when we get back!

P38: Hey! Who're you calling a kid?!

M1895: Obviously, it's the one who calls herself an idol.

P38: How dare you call me a kid!

P38: Wait a minute, get back here, you midget antique!

M1895: ...Y-You called me a midget?!

M1895: I can't just pretend I didn't hear that!

P99 looks at the feuding pair as they vanish into the distance, and sighs.

P99: While it's good that they're getting along now...

P99: It looks like they're overdoing things a little.
Part 4

In the Griffin base.

Mosin-Nagant: I haven't been able to have a proper conversation with M1895 ever since that mission.

Mosin-Nagant: She's always quiet on the few occasions I see her... I'm a little worried. I think I'll go have a chat with her.

In the Griffin dorms.

Mosin-Nagant: So there you are, M1895. I was looking high and low for you...

Mosin-Nagant: Hm? What are those parts on the table?

M1895: Good afternoon, Mosin-Nagant.

M1895: I just got these from Kalina. I'm thinking of modifying my gear.

Mosin-Nagant: You changed your clothes too?

M1895: Yup, they just arrived a couple of days ago!

M1895: I asked Kalina to help me get them too.

Mosin-Nagant: Why did you end up doing these things all of a sudden?

M1895: I spoke with P99 and P38, and they gave me some suggestions.

M1895: I need to rack my brains so I don't fall behind the young ones.

Mosin-Nagant: I originally came here to help straighten you out. Looks like it wasn't necessary.

M1895: Learning new things isn't bad. I feel like I've become stronger too.

M1895: It's just...I'd like it if I could get a little taller.

Mosin-Nagant: You can't grow any taller?

M1895: Yeah... I asked Kalina, and she said that she couldn't do anything about it at this stage...

Mosin-Nagant: You'll always be my strong and cute little sister even if you're not tall.

M1895: ...Don't start acting like a big sister out of nowhere!

Mosin-Nagant: Fine, fine. I'm relieved to see you so fired up.

Mosin-Nagant: I'm sure the Commander will also be surprised by your new look.

M1895: Really? Then I'll go find the Commander after this!

Mosin-Nagant: Before that...

Mosin-Nagant: How about a drink to celebrate?

M1895: Sure, I'm in a pretty good mood now.

M1895: I've decided...

M1895: In the days to come, I'll show the Commander something—

M1895: That the new me is more reliable than those new-model Dolls!
