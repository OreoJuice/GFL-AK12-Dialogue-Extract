...In the Griffin Command Center.

M38: Here, Commander, this is the report for our mission.

Commander: Yes, I've finished reading it.

M38: In that case...is there a problem?

M38: Because you never ask to see me on my own, Commander.

Commander: ...You're right. You see, this problem has come up many times already.

M38: M-many times...?

Commander: Yes. During the recent on-site rescue mission...

Commander: A human told you about security work at a nearby facility and I am told that you refused him?

M38: Yes...that's because I simply can't handle any tasks besides logistics...

Commander: You ought to have more faith in yourself. Given your abilities, you should be fully capable of handling security missions.

Commander: Also, it'll give everyone a better impression of Griffin if you can help do extra work...

Commander: Which means we'll get more job contracts.

M38: I'm...I'm very sorry, Commander.

Commander: There's no need to apologize. This is just a suggestion.

M38: No...

M38: What I mean is... I can't...

M38 suddenly looks down.

M38: Commander...

M38: I... I... wfz@x%zZ#rW*qfGw

Commander: What's wrong, M38?

Commander: M38?! M38!

M38: ...

M38: Later on, I heard from the others that I'd crashed right there...

...Inside the Doll dorms.

???: Ciao!

???: Are you alright?

M38: ...Miss Kalina?

???: Looks like your visual modules have mistaken me for someone else.

AR70: Allow me to introduce myself.

AR70: I am AR70, and from today onwards, I'll be your—

Before AR70 can even finish, M38 is already rubbing her eyes and getting out of bed.

M38: You're here to assess me, right...?

M38: And if I don't make the grade, they're going to sell me off?

AR70 sighs.

AR70: You know, you look pretty reliable, so why is your neural cloud so timid?

AR70: At this rate, the assessment's not going to go well, you know.

M38: ...

M38: Yes, it IS laughable, isn't it?

M38: I only LOOK dependable, so if I go in for assessment...

AR70: Pfffhahaha.

AR70: Hold on a minute, I was just kidding.

M38: Huh?

AR70 walks up to M38.

AR70: It was a joke. Just. A. Joke.

AR70: Who would make someone evaluate their friend to see if they were fit for work? I'm pretty sure that sort of thing doesn't happen in Griffin.

M38: Really?

M38: Then why did they send you here? I've always been alone...

AR70: That's why I'm here.

AR70: We checked your neural cloud several times after that crash of yours, but we haven't been able to identify the cause.

AR70: I've been sent over to prevent any problems from coming up on future missions.

M38: ...

M38: I know why I crashed...

M38: But...

AR70: In any case, I hope we can get along in the future, M38.

After a brief pause, M38 slowly lifts her head to look at AR70.

M38: I see. I understand, and I'll place myself in your care.

Kalina: Since the two of you already know each other, why don't we start you on a new mission right away?

AR70: Whoa, what are you doing here?

AR70: No, more like - why are you here to eavesdrop on us?

Kalina: Hehe, c'mon, we're all girls, so this is hardly eavesdropping, right?

M38: I knew it - I wasn't seeing things. You were hiding in the—

Kalina: Wait a minute, let's leave that as a secret between us ladies. Don't say it out loud!

Kalina: Anyway, I'm here to hand out a mission - eliminating S.F. remnants from a forward observation post.

Kalina: I've already sent the mission details to your data terminals.

AR70: Well, I'll let it slide, since missions come first.

AR70: Still...logistics again?

M38: ...Understood.

M38: But where is the Commander, Miss Kalina? It's usually the Commander who issues my assignments.

Kalina: The Commander's preparing for some kind of operation, so they're not free to come over for the time being.

M38: I see. I hope I didn't give the Commander too much trouble back then.

Kalina: So it really IS bothering M38. I can't tell her that the Commander is wondering if they did the right thing.

Kalina: Well, don't worry about it. The Commander can take care of any problems which come up with one hand while sipping a cappuccino with the other.

M38: Huh? Are they really drinking a cappuccino right now?

AR70: Well, it's our Commander we're talking about. I wouldn't be surprised.

AR70: Alright, M38 - let's get ready to move out.

M38: Understood, beginning preparations immediately.
Part 2

After AR70 and M38 reach the designated area...

They begin fighting the S.F. remnants.

M38: Two more left at 3 o'clock!

AR70: OK, heading there now.

The battle ends swiftly thanks to the coordination of the pair.

M38: ...Mission complete.

AR70: These Sangvis scum are easily eliminated when they don't have support from their command post.

AR70 bends down and begins recovering S.F. components.

M38: It would be best not to make light of them.

AR70: Hm? You sound like you're very experienced.

AR70: At first, I thought you refused the security job because you were afraid of fighting.

M38 shakes her head.

M38: I'm not afraid of battle.

M38: I'm simply more used to logistics missions.

AR70: While I'd like to ask you what happened to you in the past, I have the feeling you wouldn't tell me even if I did.

M38: Yeah, I'm sorry...

AR70: That's fine. We civilian Dolls all have our secrets.

AR70: Anyway, the mission's pretty much over, so let's get ready to go back—

Suddenly, M38 raises her gun.

M38: AR70, did you hear that?

AR70's brows furrow, then she raises her gun too.

AR70: Did you find something?

???: (Sobbing and weeping)

M38: ——!

AR70: That sounds like... Is that a crying child?

I'm not picking up any Doll signals nearby. That has to be the sound of a human child...

Human Girl: (More sobbing)

M38 and AR70 exchange glances, then immediately split up to search for the person in need of aid.

M38: We're Tactical Dolls from Griffin. Please tell us your position.

Human Girl: (Even more sobbing)

M38: I repeat, we are Tactical Dolls from Griffin, please give us your position so we can proceed there and render assistance.

The girl gulps and mumbles a few unintelligible words.

M38: That's no good, that's not enough for me to pinpoint your position... Please provide us with detailed coordinates.

AR70: Didn't she state them clearly?

M38: Huh? But I didn't hear anything.

AR70: We'll leave that aside for now. The situation is critical, so follow me.

...Thirty minutes later, AR70 and M38 have rescued the human girl from underneath a collapsed building.

However, they now face a new problem—

Human Girl: (Sobbing and moaning)

M38: Please stop crying. We can escort you back if you supply us with the necessary coordinates.

The human girl is still crying, and her face has turned a little pale.

M38: Um...

AR70: Let me handle this.

M38 complies and backs away.

After that, AR70 slowly approaches the human girl...

She puts down her gun and kneels in front of the her.

AR70: La mia principessa...

AR70: It's alright now. You can hold me if you're scared...

Human Girl: ...

The girl ceases crying, but her eyes seem hollow and unfocused. She stands mutely in place.

At that moment, AR70 takes the initiative and embraces the human girl in a hug.

The human girl returns the embrace in response.

AR70: Your clothes are very pretty. Who bought them for you?

Human Girl: My...mama...

After that, AR70 and M38 successfully escort the human girl to a safe house and start heading back to Griffin.

M38: You're amazing, AR70.

M38: Were you a service-model Doll once?

AR70: Perhaps.

AR70: I deleted those memories after connecting to Griffin's database.

M38: Why? Did something happen to you in the past?

M38: Was that why you came to Griffin...?

AR70: Hey, you haven't even told me YOUR story.

M38: I...

AR70: Still, it's not going to get in the way of me telling you why I deleted my memories.

M38: Huh?

AR70: I don't remember the exact reason because I deleted my memories.

AR70: But I do remember that back then, I wanted to change myself.

M38: Change yourself...? That sounds like a really human reason to have.

M38: I'm kind of envious. If I'd deleted my memories when I joined...

M38: Then I wouldn't have to run from them like I'm doing now.

AR70: Oh? I think you should tell me about what happened. I might be able to help you out.

M38: Alright...
Part 3

Under AR70's unrelenting questioning, M38 finally reveals her past...

M38: Once...I used to be a civilian Doll working in the security sector.

M38: But during my career, I'd made a lot of unforgivable mistakes...

AR70: Hm...so that's how you ended up in Griffin?

M38: Yes. I was...defective, no longer needed.

M38: Even while I'm here, I always worry about whether I'd make mistakes again.

M38: If I only screwed up in logistics, I probably wouldn't be sold off...

M38: It's embarrassing, huh, running away from my responsibilities like that.

Doink—

AR70 lightly thumps M38 on the head with her buttstock.

M38: Ack!

AR70: You dummy! Haven't you changed already?

M38: (Whimpers) What did you say? I couldn't hear you 'cause I'm all dizzy.

AR70: I said, haven't you changed already?!

M38: But I'm still trying to dodge my official assignments issued by the Commander...

M38: Oh yeah, did you leave out a few words when you repeated yourself?

AR70: You don't know yourself at all, do you?

AR70: Leave the rest to me, I'll give you a push in the right direction.

M38: But how...

AR70: Just do as I tell you.

M38: Alright, I believe in you.

M38: Also, it's kind of bothering me - what DID you leave out just now?

AR70: Don't ask. I was praising you.

M38: Really...? Thanks...

Two hours later, AR70 drags M38 to the Commander's office.

At the sight of the two Dolls entering in a rush, the Commander quickly puts down the cup of coffee.

Commander: So, did you complete the mission?

AR70: Yup, and we handed the mission log to Kalina.

Commander: So why are you here?

AR70: Commander!

Commander: Hm?!

AR70: We, AR70 and M38, would like to request permission to take part in frontline operation ■■■.

Commander: ...

Commander: That's not a simple mission. Have you thought this through?

Just then, AR70 shoves M38 forward.

M38: I-I'll manage!

Commander: M38, this op is definitely not going to be logistics work...

Commander: Are you sure you can you handle it?

M38: I...

AR70: Listen, the fact that you've realized that you've been running away is a sign that you've begun to change.

M38: But I can't handle proper missions... I might even end up crashing.

AR70: Your neural cloud's been damaged from your past experiences.

AR70: Therefore, you need to make new memories to overwrite the ones that make you freeze up.

M38: I understand what you mean... But how should I take the first step?

AR70: Before we head back, clear your cache and record what I'm about to say.

AR70: After that, stop reading the records in your memory module for a while.

AR70: Your biggest obstacle is the fact that you crash whenever you "accept an official mission"...

AR70: So if you can overcome that just once, your neural cloud will automatically rectify itself.

M38: That sounds really complicated, can I really do it?

AR70: It's doesn't matter even if you fail. You can just start over again.

AR70: The only thing is that next time, I won't be with you.

M38: Eh?!

AR70: There's a big operation coming up soon, and I'm going to use it to get myself promoted.

M38: I see... I really envy you, AR70.

AR70: If you envy me, then catch up quickly. Come with me and return victorious for the Commander's sake.

M38: ...I understand.

M38: I'll do my best!

M38: I...I want to...

M38: Go with AR70...

Commander: Are you sure, M38?

Commander: There's a high chance this mission might bring you into contact with humans, and they...

Upon hearing the word "humans", M38 involuntarily accesses her past memories.

All she can see now is darkness...

M38: Humans...

Human Male: How could you screw up such a simple job?

M38: I-I'm sorry... It's because I haven't cleared my cache for 24 hours...

Human Male: Quit trying to make excuses! Who do you think you are, a human?

Human Male: You're nothing but a cog, and a broken one at that!

Human Male: Now what are we going to do? All our money's gone!

M38: I-I'm sorry...

Human Male: What? You think apologizing is enough? You think it'll bring the money back?

M38: No...I wasn't thinking that...

M38: Back then...my neural cloud was no longer capable of speech... All I could do was keep apologizing...

M38: And I heard my employer sigh over and over again in exasperation with my incompetence.

M38: How can I make up for my past mistakes?

M38: ...

Commander: M38?

Commander: M38!

...
Part 4

...

M38: The Commander's calling out to me...

M38: But why can't I respond to the Commander?

M38: Why can I never say the things I want to say? Am I afraid?

M38: And if I am... What am I afraid of?

Human Male: We've decided how to punish you for your failure.

Human Male: Even if you ARE a Doll, you ought to take responsibility for your actions. You understand, right?

M38: Yes... I understand.

M38: From that day on, I had to do more and more security work, and I had fewer and fewer chances to clear my cache.

M38: I was no longer on the maintenance schedule either.

M38: I spent every day being lectured for my previous failure.

M38: I kept apologizing each time.

M38: I worked all the time, without stopping.

M38: Even then, I was never forgiven...

M38: Not long after, I made another mistake.

Human Male: Well, look at that. You aren't even as capable as a human being.

M38: I-I'm sorry.

Human Male: Apologizing again?

Human Male: I've heard enough, we don't need you anymore.

M38: —!

M38: Am...am I going to be sold off?

Human Male: What do you think?

Human Male: Ever since you started working here, you've only brought in three times your investment in profits.

Human Male: Selling you off now is pretty much squeezing the last bit of value from you. At least this way you'll make an extra bit of cash for us.

M38: ...I understand.

M38: I'm going to be recalled after this, huh...

M38: I don't mind. After all, I was created to be a cog that turned for my employer.

M38: And now that I'm a broken cog, I ought to be disposed of.

M38: Even so, I couldn't even make that last bit of money for them...

M38: I ended up crashing on the way to the plant due to a cache overflow.

M38: And then—

Doink.

AR70 karate-chops M38's head.

AR70: Calm down, you dummy.

AR70: You're a Doll working under the Commander now, not the you of the past.

M38: Ow—!

M38: Huh? D-dummy...?

Upon seeing AR70's stern face, M38 accesses the records she's sealed away for a long time...

And they are...

???: Oh? So you came here because you messed up several times at your job?

M38: It's a bit more complicated than that - I don't deserve to be a Doll.

M38: I just hope that my parts will be of use to someone else in the future...

???: Is that your excuse for melting down your neural cloud?

M38: Then what else should I do?

M38: I'm afraid...

M38: I'm afraid I'll keep making mistakes!

Doink.

M38: Ow—!

???: Think carefully, you dummy. Are you really just afraid of making mistakes?

M38: Aren't I?

M38: If not...

M38: Then what is it that I'm afraid of?

???: Go figure it out yourself. I can't be bothered to guide you right now.

???: I'll be going over to that Griffin place afterwards.

???: Since you're waiting to be collected for scrap anyway, you can consider going there if you can't think of an answer.

M38: I remember now.

M38: Thank you, AR70. Thank you for reminding me of my original goal.

AR70: Well, don't crash again. You've got to show the Commander your strength.

M38 nods, then she slowly closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.

M38: Am I really just afraid of making mistakes?

M38: When the former "AR70" asked me about it, I realized the truth.

M38: I realized the reason why I rejected that logistics mission and why I crashed afterwards.

M38: It was all because I didn't want to become the failure that I used to be.

M38: Therefore—

M38 gazes unflinchingly at Commander, her eyes gleaming like sapphires.

M38: What I ought to do is face "my old self, who was a failure."

M38: Commander, I'd like to explain the reason why I've been dodging missions all this time.

The Commander nods, quietly watching M38.

M38: I was once a service Doll used in security missions.

M38: However, I made mistakes often and was a disappointment for my employer.

M38: I came here after that, and all I thought about was how to avoid making mistakes...

M38: I didn't want to remember my old self anymore.

M38: I didn't want to become a failure again, like before.

M38: As a result, I kept avoiding proper missions, only taking logistics missions where mistakes would not matter.

M38: Perhaps I unconsciously thought that it was a way of changing myself.

M38: But it was wrong. All I had been doing was simply treading water.

M38: And then...

M38 glances at AR70.

M38: Someone told me that it's doesn't matter even if I fail. I can just start over again.

M38: And so I will do everything I can to clear a path forward for you, Commander!

A moment later...

Commander: I see.

M38: That means...!

AR70: You did it, M38!

AR70 runs up and hugs M38.

M38: Haha... I finally took the first step in changing myself.

Commander: Well, I'll allow AR70 to take part in the mission, but M38... I'll need to keep you under observation for a bit longer.

M38: Huh?

AR70: What?

Commander: While I'm glad you managed to overcome your past traumas, for the sake of the mission...

Commander: I think it's best that I keep observing you for a little longer.

Commander: You could very well experience your very first failure soon. Can you accept that?

M38: ...

M38: Yes!

...Several days later.

At the frontlines, where the fighting with Sangvis Ferri is the fiercest.

AR70: Honestly, the Commander is way too harsh. I can't believe M38 has to remain under observation for a whole month.

AR70: Well, all the best to her. I'm going to use this to get promoted.

Scarecrow: Oh? You're planning to take this location by yourself?

AR70: When did you get here, Sangvis scum?

Scarecrow: I'll tell you in three minutes, assuming you're not scrap by then.

Bang.

AR70: Tsk...

Scarecrow: First, I'll start with your left leg, and then...

AR70: Am I really going down in this place...

M38: Of course not. How could you possibly fall here?

AR70: You're here at last.

AR70: Still, how did you get here? I thought the Commander said they'd be watching you for a month.

M38: I requested a neural upgrade because I wanted to come here and make myself useful ASAP. That way I wouldn't need to be put under observation.

Scarecrow: Hehe, so, the piles of scrap have multiplied. Just as well, you've saved me the trouble of looking for you.

AR70: While I hate to admit it...

AR70: These Sangvis units have superior specs.

AR70: Without reinforcements...

M38: Reinforcements? I AM the reinforcement.

M38: Get up, AR70, we'll crush her together.

AR70: ...That sounded pretty cool.

AR70: Are you confident about this?

M38: I've already taken the first step towards changing myself.

M38: Don't you want to follow me?

AR70: Oh?

AR70: Hehe, lead the way, then!

Scarecrow: Are you done with your last words? Whatever they are, your mission is doomed to fail. Now rust here as scrap metal.

M38: You're going to make us fail? Do it if you can—

M38: I'll show you the power of Griffin's new equipment.

M38: I won't be afraid of becoming my old self, "the failure", again...

M38: Because I know that even if I fail, someone will be waiting for me, and someone will have gotten up before me.

M38: In that case, all I have to do is move forward with all of my strength — the change in me begins here!
