In the Griffin dormitory.

M4A1: My first live combat mission is tomorrow.

M4A1: I should really be getting a good rest, but I don't feel like sleeping at all...

M4A1: I guess I'm just too nervous...

M4A1: Phew...relax, relax...

...Half an hour later.

M4A1: Ah...I still can't fall asleep.

M4A1: The others wouldn't be at ease if they know just how nervous their team leader is...

M4A1: ......

M4A1: Since I can't sleep, I might as well draw up a few contingency plans.

M4A1: Everyone else is asleep, so I'll need to be quiet...so I don't wake them up.

Inside the Operations Room.

M4A1: Hm...according to the map, it would be better to fall back from this direction if we encounter the enemy in this sector...

M4A1: And if we exchange fire, we should attack from here...

???: So that's where you are.

M4A1: Eh!?

M4A1: Oh, it's you, AR-15...

M4A1: Weren't you asleep?

AR-15: ...I woke up to get some air.

AR-15: What about you, why aren't you in bed?

M4A1: I couldn't fall asleep...

M4A1: I felt restless while lying on my bed, so I thought I might as well do some planning.

M4A1: That way, at least we'll have a response ready if we encounter any contingencies tomorrow...

AR-15: Do you really need to do so much planning for a simple recon mission?

AR-15: We might not even get a chance to trade fire with the enemy.

M4A1: I'm the team leader, so it's only natural for me to plan about these things...

M4A1: Also, since this is our first mission together, I want to complete it flawlessly.

I see the corners of AR-15's mouth tilt up into a slight smile right as I say "complete it flawlessly".

Then, we talk about many things, including our mission and our own goals...

And we also talk about our similarities.

AR15 is as austere as always, but for some reason, it seems like she begins to loosen up as our conversation goes on.

......

M4A1: AR-15.

M4A1: Goodnight...I'll be counting on you tomorrow.

AR-15: ......

AR-15: ...That's only to be expected.

AR-15 leaves.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Only to be expected, huh...

I leave the Ops Room and look up into the distance.

The cool night wind blows away the confusion in my heart, and I'm certain of the direction that I'll be taking tomorrow.

M4A1: In that case...

M4A1: Leading everyone to victory is also to be expected.

...

???: M4...

???: ......

???: M4A1...

My head feels so heavy...

Is someone... Is someone calling me?

A voice reaches my ears, one that sounds strangely familiar.

I open my eyes at the call of that voice.

M4A1: ......

M4A1: I... Where am I...

M4A1: ...!

M4A1: This...

M4A1: A...AR...

AR-15: Don't squirm.

AR-15: You're really heavy.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Is that...really you?

AR-15: Don't move your head. Hearing my voice should be enough, right?

M4A1: Why...

M4A1: ...I don't believe it!

M4A1: AR-15... You...you're alive!?

AR-15: Let's get out of here first. I'll explain it to you afterward.

M4A1: But why... Why did you show up here and now...

AR-15: I have a mission of my own. Running into you was simply a coincidence.

AR-15: But...I guess it's not a bad thing.

......

I'm meeting her all over again.

AR-15... She's still alive.

This should be a complete surprise to me—

This is the miracle I've longed for ever since she disappeared.

I should be greeting her with a smile.

But right now, I can't bring myself to do it.

All the people who helped me...

All the people who accompanied me, just as AR-15 had...

Where have they gone?

M4A1: Where are the others?

M4A1: Where are SOP II...and RO?

AR-15: ...Now is not the time to think about them. S.F. elites are still around.

AR-15: Focus on what's in front of you, keep quiet, and fall back with me.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: SOP II...

M4A1: RO...

M4A1: I...remember...

M4A1: I saw RO and...

M4A1: No! I can't... I can't leave them behind!

M4A1: Put me down, let me go back!

AR-15: Keep still! In your current condition, S.F. will capture you before you can take more than a few steps if I let you go!

M4A1: And whose fault is it that I'm like this!?

AR-15: We had no choice but to sever your level two connection in order to break the link between you and the people monitoring you.

M4A1: The people monitoring me?

M4A1: ...Who? Who's monitoring me?

AR-15: Did you really think Sangvis Ferri was our only enemy?

M4A1: What... What exactly is going on...

M4A1: Isn't Griffin's mission...to wipe out Sangvis Ferri...?

M4A1: I...I abandoned my teammates and my objective...

AR-15: Whatever you want to do, get some rest first.

AR-15: We'll give you the power you want after that...

M4A1: ......

I should have led them to them an expected victory.

But now, I've lost everything...both my teammates and my target.

AR-15's words fill me with guilt and uneasiness, and I...I'm even more confused now.

What should I do?

...

I should be looking for them right now...

SOP-II...RO...

But I can't do that in my state.

I can't even control my own body.

I need power...

If only I had more power...

I...

...

Later on, inside a certain safe house.

AK-12: I can't believe your neural cloud is in such a mess from just a simple disconnection...

AK-12: It's too fragile, even for an older Doll model...

M4A1: I'm sorry, but will fixing it take a long time?

AK-12: It'll be fine once I run a few repair programs on the equipment.

AK-12: Since we have time, I should probably perform an upgrade on you with the gear we have on hand.

M4A1: An upgrade? Is that necessary?

M4A1: A repair will be enough. If you randomly poke around with an upgrade...

AK-12: This is an order, so be obedient.

AK-12: Lie down and be still. You have a lot of unused ports, so it won't take long.

M4A1: Alright...thank you, Miss AK-12.

Letting someone other than Miss Persica open up my body is somewhat worrying. But given the present circumstances, I need to get rid of my weak-mindedness of the past.

It'll be alright, even if she just slaps a bunch of parts together for an upgrade...

I need to be able to fight.

I'm going to find my friends and my objective again.

I need strength for that.

I will find my enemies...and then I will destroy them!

...AK-12 begins the upgrading work with clicks and clacks.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...AR-15.

AR-15: ...

M4A1: Apart from us...and RO and SOP-II...

M4A1: ...How are...the Commander...and the other Dolls doing now?

...AR-15 hesitates for a moment.

AR-15: It's none of our business...

AR-15: They should have withdrawn, according to what AK-12 said the last time she mentioned them.

M4A1: Have they withdrawn safely?

AK-12: How shall I say this... Given the situation, they probably would have taken heavy losses.

AK-12: Even from an optimistic guess...

M4A1: As I thought...

M4A1: Those Sangvis scum!

M4A1: It's all the Mastermind's fault... She tricked me...and because of her, everyone's...

M4A1: I won't forgive them for this! I will never forgive them!!

AK-12: ...

...AK-12 glances over to AR-15, who sighs.

AR-15: M4A1...

AR-15: I'm going to tell you the truth, but you have to stay calm.

M4A1: What?

AR-15: The culprit behind Griffin's defeat in this operation is not Sangvis Ferri, but the military.

AR-15: From the start...it has always been a military conspiracy.

M4A1: What...are you saying?

M4A1: But we were clearly...

AR-15: I know you're very confused, M4A1, but this is the truth.

AR-15: SOP-II...and RO... It was the work of the military.

M4A1: The military...

M4A1: No, I don't get it... Why...

M4A1: Wasn't the military behind the entire operation... Shouldn't they be...against Sangvis Ferri...

M4A1: Why...did they...to RO... Just who exactly did it? Was it really someone from the military!?

AK-12: A squad of humans from the military killed them. That much is obvious from the bullet holes and the debris they left behind.

AK-12: Of course, they'll cover it up by saying they were "getting rid of out-of-control Dolls".

AR-15: M4A1, do you know a Captain Yegor?

M4A1: ...

AR-15: He's the mastermind and culprit behind the attack on all of you.

AR-15: I believe he personally shot RO635.

M4A1: Yegor? No, how could this be... Isn't he...

AR-15: M4A1, Yegor is the one who set up the AR Team. That much is certain.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Yegor's the murderer...

AK-12: Are you afraid? The target of your revenge is an enemy that's much, much scarier than Sangvis Ferri.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: If that's really true...

M4A1: Then it doesn't matter who they are, whether they're Dolls...or humans...

M4A1: I will kill them with my own two hands. I swear it.

AK-12: Oh my, this isn't a declaration that an average Doll would make.

AK-12: Anyway, the upgrade's almost complete. Don't go running off after it's done. Listen to AR-15's orders, okay?

AR-15: M4A1, our mission is to determine the motive behind this military operation.

AR-15: Join us once everything is ready. You'll get your answers.

M4A1: Join your team?

AK-12: We're called DEFY. Do you like the name?

Treachery and defiance...they go together very well.

It doesn't take much thinking for me to reach my conclusion.

If I can't bring back my comrades, then there's only one thing I must do—

M4A1: I'm in, as long as I can avenge RO635 and SOP-II.

M4A1: I will obey orders from you and Ange until I achieve my objective.
Part 4

The battle ends.

M4A1: All enemies exterminated. We can move on to the next objective.

AK-12: Your performance after the repairs is pretty good.

AK-12: But don't push yourself too hard. It would be a shame if you were to break again just after you get fixed.

M4A1: My body feels very light now... Both my aiming speed and mobility have improved tremendously... Your skills are amazing, AK-12.

AK-12: I'm not one to get happy from praises.

AK-12: I'm worried that your neural cloud hasn't fully adapted to the newly-installed components.

AK-12: What are we going to do if overusing them leads to incompatibility issues, and your neural cloud breaks down? Not to mention, I heard you...

M4A1: It only needs to last until I can personally destroy my target. That won't take long.

Yes, this is all I need.

I have obtained new strength, and I have found my target again.

I once thought that it is only to be expected that I bring victory to my team, in order to bring them glory.

It's still the same now. I will continue winning.

My victories will pile up one after the other until I reach my objective.

It doesn't matter if they're humans or Dolls...

Everyone who has hurt me and my friends...

Will face total vengeance!
