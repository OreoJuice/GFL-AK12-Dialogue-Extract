If I could choose all over again, I wouldn't have attended this tea party or whatever tonight.

Those damn desserts were tempting me all this time, forcing me to endure the ghost stories of that thrill-seeking bunch.

And now things are better than ever. Instead of ghost stories, I'm personally experiencing true terror—

Type 59: Save meeeeeeeeee— mffff!

The repairs to the electrical cabling in the corridor had been delayed for several days, making the hallway at night spookier than usual.

Scarier still, the hand in the darkness firmly grasps Type 59, who's heading back to her dorm.

And then, she loses even the chance to breathe.

???: Shhhhhh!

Type 59: Mmmf...huh? Is...is that you...Type 80?

Type 80: Yes, it's me.

Type 59: Well, this is unusual. I'm actually seeing you outside of combat. I thought you were an electronic ghost or something...

Type 59: (Coughs) Honestly, you youngsters.. So why are you hiding here to scare people?

Type 80: I wasn't! I'm here to find you!

Type 59: You're looking for me?

Springfield: The cream puffs are here.

Type 59: Wow! I didn't expect dessert at a time like this. Lucky me!

Type 59: Still, these must have cost a lot of credits, right? I feel bad about eating so much of a junior's food...

Type 80: Don't worry, I only ever buy bubblegum most of the time, so I have lots of credit banked up.

Type 59: Miss Springfield, 10 more puffs please!

Springfield: Okay~

Type 59: I know we don't usually speak to each other, but you don't look like the sort who has trouble communicating with people.

Type 80: Well, the important thing is... I'd like to ask you a favor.

Type 59: I should have guessed, there's no way you'd buy me treats for nothing, hahaha...

Type 80: Please, don't sell yourself short. I've been observing you - you can take part in tea parties every day and actively engage people in conversation, even when the topics are deep and profound.

Type 80: So I think you'll definitely be able to help.

Type 59: Well, even if you say that, there are some things I might not be able to do...

Type 80: I'll buy you all the desserts you want from now on, Miss 59!

Type 59: Right, leave it to me!

Type 59: So...what is it?

Type 80: Here's the thing... I want to ask the Commander for a neural upgrade.

Type 59: ...

Type 59: What have you done now?

Type 80: Hm?

Type 59: Huh?

Springfield: The second batch of puffs are here~

...

Type 59: (Burps) I'm full.

Type 59: Why do Dolls have limited stomach capacity, anyway?

Type 59: There are still nine puffs left, what should I do...?

Type 80: Are you listening, Miss 59?

Type 59: Yes, yes, I hear you. So basically you want a neural upgrade but you don't know how to get the Commander to say yes...

Type 59: So your plan is to show how hardworking you are and convince the Commander that you deserve an upgrade, is that it?

Type 80: Yup!

Type 59: And you want to do it in an easy, effortless way that you can pull off with your eyes closed, is that it?

Type 80: Yes, zero effort please!

Type 59: Give me a break.

Type 80: Huh?

Type 59: Have you seen anyone get a neural upgrade without trying at all? And why do you even want an upgrade when you're as lazy as that?!

Type 80: That's because...I'll become really cool.

Type 59: Hah?

A new customer enters the café just as they're speaking.

Type 80: Ohh, there she is.

Type 80: I brought you here for a reason.

Type 59: What?

Type 97S: Boss lady, one pound of wontons please!

Springfield: Oh dear, I'm afraid we don't serve those here.

Type 97S: Ahaha, I was just messing with you. Something sweet, then!

Springfield: Coming~

Type 80: Did you see that?

Type 59: See what?

Type 80: Type 97S! Look at how she is after her upgrade—

Type 80: She's cool, stylish and cuts a striking figure!

Type 59: Well yes, she is very cool.

Type 80: Type 97S must be really popular, right?

Type 80: Which means if I get a neural upgrade, I'll be popular too, don't you think?

Type 59: ...

Type 59: Wait, is that the reason why you're doing this?

Type 80: ...Yup!

Type 59: Fine then, it's unusual that you're taking the initiative to mix with the others, so I don't mind helping you out.

Type 59: However, I haven't undergone a neural upgrade myself, nor do I know what requirements you have to meet to get one...

Type 59: Hey, since Hawk is here, we can just ask her!

Type 59: Hey, Hawk! Over here!

Type 97S: 59? Well, what a surprise meeting you here. Shouldn't you have turned in by now?

Type 59: Well, I still have 9 cream puffs... Ahem, anyway, let's get to the point.

Type 59: You got a neural upgrade, right? We're all very curious about how you managed to get one.

Type 59: Also, how did getting the upgrade feel?

Type 97S: My neural upgrade? Hm... I don't know how to describe it.

Type 97S: However, the upgrade process was really quick and efficient. I just closed my eyes for a bit, nothing special.

Type 59: You can't describe it? Could you go into more detail?!

Type 97S: Hey, your eyes are practically glowing!

Type 97S: In any case, it was a weird experience... But why are you asking about this? Is the Commander going to give you a neural upgrade?

Type 59: Oh, it's not me, it's her...

Type 59: Eh? Where'd she go?!

Type 97S: Was there someone else here?

Type 59: She was sitting here just a moment ago... How strange.

Type 59: I'll go find her. Enjoy your dessert.

Springfield: Miss Type 59, the credits...

Type 59: What? She said she'd pay for me... Meh, forget it, let's see the bill...

Type 59: Ehhhhh?! Did I actually eat THIS much?

Type 59: I, er, well... I'll come back when I have enough credit!

Type 59 runs off without looking back.

Springfield: Oh my, what will I ever do with them...

Type 80: ...

Type 59: (Pants heavily)

Type 59: Found you at last!

Type 80: Ah, Miss 59!

Type 59: Why did you run off without saying a word? You didn't even pay the bill!

Type 80: Sorry, but I was just too embarrassed to ask someone about their neural upgrade...

Type 80: So, did you learn anything?

Type 59: From her? She said it was a strange experience, but she didn't elaborate.

Type 80: I see...

Type 59: Look at yourself! Don't give up just because you're met with a little bit of resistance! Though I didn't get much from her, I have an idea.

Type 80: Huh?

Type 59: Think about it. You need permission for a neural upgrade, and doesn't that permission come from the Commander?

Type 59: If we put in a little effort and show the Commander your sincerity in wanting to earn a neural upgrade, It'll be a piece of cake!

Type 80: Oh, that kinda makes sense...

Type 80: ...Wait, what kind of effort?

Type 59: Stop dreaming about getting something for nothing!

Type 59: You want to know what sincerity is? It's a practical, level-headed approach of doing things, don't you see?

Type 59: Not only do you have to work hard, you also need to show the Commander that you have limitless potential. Only then will the Commander acknowledge and approve of you!

Type 80: B-but...

Type 59: If that's too much for you, then you can find someone else to help you out!

Type 59: Oh boy, looks like I'll never get to see the super popular post-upgrade Type 80~!

Type 80: (Groans) F-fine! I'll do it!

Type 59: Hehehe, that's more like it. It'll be easy if you're willing to put your back into it!

Type 80: But how should I work hard so that the Commander will notice me?

Type 59: Well... Don't set the bar too high when you're just starting out. You can begin with simple things. As the saying goes, it takes a hard man to make steel—

Type 59: Oh yeah, some of the girls say that you have certain "quirks" that drive people away. Maybe you'd get good results if you start by fixing those.

Type 80: What quirks do I have?

Type 59: Calling them "quirks" is already putting them very mildly! I'll give you three simple examples!

Type 59: For starters, your laziness!

Type 80: My laziness... Does that actually matter?

Type 59: Look at you! That's what I mean!

Type 59: There's no way the Commander would see potential in anyone this indolent, so you need to change that!

Type 59: Since you sought me out to help earn you a neural upgrade, that means you at least have the motivation to learn and improve! As someone who's been there before, I believe you can do it!

Type 80: Oh...

Type 59: Secondly - you look too mean!

Type 80: Well that's true, but when I take off my glasses...

Type 59: (Twitches) Look, I know you don't have a grudge against me, but it's really scary when you stare at me like that.

Type 80: Sorry for scaring you.

Type 59: Whew, you look much cuter with your glasses on...

Type 59: Ahem. Right. The third and final point - your obsession with bubble gum!

Type 80: Eh?!

Type 59: Don't you "eh" me! Every time I see you, you're blowing bubbles! That is NOT the image a Tactical Doll ought to have!

Type 80: A-aren't there other Dolls who eat snacks all the time?

Type 59: All the more reason for you to quit that habit! Think about it, if all the other Dolls are snacking and you're the only one who quit bubble gum, wouldn't that be a great accomplishment?

Type 80: (Grumbles)

Type 59: Just quit it. Look, you managed to accept the first two points already, why not put your foot down and do it?

Type 80: Fine, I'll quit!

Type 59: Very good! We've taken a solid first step!

Type 59: Next, I'll come up with a special curriculum to address those three points of yours. We'll call it the "Model Soldier Training Program!"

Type 59: As long as the plan works, you'll be able to gain the Commander's approval for sure!

Type 80: I knew I was right to come to you for help, Miss 59.

Type 80: Shall we start now?

Type 59: It's already very late. Let's meet at the shooting range next morning. That will mark the official beginning!

Type 80: Okay.

Type 59: Next up...

Type 59: Are you going back to your dorm now, Type 80?

Type 80: Yeah... Why?

Type 59: Heeheeheehee, let's go back together!

...
Part 2

2

The day after making the promise with Type 80, at the practice range—

Type 59: To become a model soldier, you must be able to endure hardship, fear no difficulty, and challenge yourself!

Type 59: And the most important thing is to obey rules and regulations!

Type 80: (Blows)

Pop!

The bubble bursts all over Type 80's mouth.

Type 59: —You're STILL blowing those bubbles!!!

Type 59: You said you were going to quit, so why are you blowing bubbles first thing in the morning?!

Type 80: Oh... It's fine, I can always quit when we start for real.

Type 59: We've! Already! Started!

Type 59: (Sighs) Slackers and lazy bums everywhere. The youngsters these days are just terrible. When I think about how things used to be back in my day...

Type 80: Alright, alright, I won't blow any more bubbles.

Type 59: You think not blowing bubbles is the end of it?

Type 59: Give it here —!

Type 59 extends a hand to Type 80.

Type 80: ...?

Type 80: Oh, if you wanted some, you should have said so. Here, have a piece.

Type 59: I'm telling you to hand over ALL your bubble gum!

Type 80: Ack, b-be gentle, I-I'll hand it over...

Type 80: (Squeals) There's no bubble gum there, stoooop—!

...

Type 59: ...64...66...68...

Type 59: Good lord, how did you manage to hide THAT many pieces of gum on you?

Type 80: (Sobs) Why are we starting by quitting gum...

Type 59: How are you going to be a model soldier if you can't even endure this?

Type 59: Also, the REAL training is only just beginning. Here, catch!

Type 80: Is this...a bucket?

Type 80: Is there a fire somewhere?

Type 59: No... And listen up!

Type 59: The reason I chose to conduct your training at the range is so you can experience the joy of hard work!

Type 80: Hard work?

Type 59: Do you see your friends training over there? The floor is covered in their shell casings, it would be terrible if someone slipped and fell on them.

Type 80: Oh, that's fine, the cleaning robot is always on duty... Huh, where is it?

Type 59: I turned it off.

Type 80: ...Then it's your fault if anyone slips and falls.

Type 59: I won't let that happen, because from now on, YOU will be picking up the shell casings!

Type 80: Ehhhhhhhh?!

Type 80: Do, do I have to do it in front of everyone...?

Type 59: What a wonderful opportunity for you to show off your hardworking and helpful side!

Type 80: B-b-b-but...

Type 59: No buts! Now get in there!

...

Range Doll A: Hey, is it me or are there a lot more shell casings on the ground now?

Range Doll B: Kind of seems that way... Is the cleaning robot not at work?

Range Doll B: Wait a minute, what's that over there?

As the Dolls look on dubiously, a petite Doll comes over with a bucket in hand.

Type 80: ...

Since she's holding her hat over her face, she is forced to put the bucket down one-handed on the opposite side of the firing booth from the Doll occupying it, then feel around for shell casings and dump them into the bucket before moving onto the next firing position.

Thud!

Type 80: Oof...!

Range Doll A: She hit the booth wall.

Range Doll B: ...Is she still going to cover her face with her hat even after that?

Range Doll A: Ahhh, forget it, don't get distracted... Ahhhhhhh, I missed again!

SKS: Uwaaaaahhhhh—!

Range Doll B: Good heavens, SKS, what are you doing on the drone again?!

SKS: Hey! Quit talking nonsense about me! Everyone was firing wildly just now!

The shooting range immediately erupts into an argument.

Type 80: Oh, this is a good chance!

While the other Dolls' attention is diverted, Type 80 quickly sweeps up all the shell casings with her hat and dumps them all into the bucket.

Type 80: Alright, now I'm fin...

PM1910: Sweet! This range has so many open spots! Time to let 'er rip!

PM1910: ORAORAORAORAORAORAAAAAAAAAAA!

Just as she's about to wrap up her task, Type 80 is forced to watch as PM1910's gun spews flames and spent brass everywhere. Every last tinkle of each shell casing that hits the ground shreds away at her patience.

PM1910: Ahahahahaha! That was great!

PM1910: Now, let's try something else...

Mondragon: PM1910! I told you we were setting out already! Why are you still wasting time here?!

PM1910: Tsk! Fine, fine, I'm coming! Damn slavedriver!

PM1910 slings her machine gun over her shoulder and nonchalantly walks off, leaving the ground littered with shell casings in her wake.

Type 80: I... You...!

Type 59: 80! Calm down, calm down, I say!

...

Type 80: At...at last...it's...the last one...!

Type 80: It's finally over!

Type 59: Done picking them up? Let me see...

Type 59: Hm, well done! Even I'm starting to think you have a bright future!

Type 80: Will the Commander give me a neural upgrade now?

Type 59: Oh please, you must be dreaming. How could the Commander notice you after just that tiny amount of work?

Type 80: But I worked really hard.

Type 59: Keep at it, young lady!

Type 59: All this is for the sake of your neural upgrade!

Type 80: Ugh, I don't want to do anything else tomorrow.。

Type 80: ...

Type 80: Let's just...

Type 80 reaches into her pocket on reflex, but her hand comes back empty.

Type 80: Oh, right.

Type 80: 59...

Type 59: Nope.

Type 80: Miss 59, you look so pretty today.

Type 59: Flattery won't get you anywhere.

Type 80: Tsk. I've got no choice then...

Type 80 opens the box magazine of her machine gun, takes out a piece of gum and peels it open with practiced ease.

Type 59: Ehhh?!

Type 80: Nom...mmm~!

Type 59: Stop! Don't chew that!

Type 80: Aw, it's already in my mouth, it would be a shame to waste it, Miss 59.

Type 59: Enough of that nonsense, spit it out right now!!!

...
Part 3

In the dorm—

Type 59: Well, I've checked you from top to bottom, inside and out, and I've even stripped your gun down twice...

Type 59: That should be all the bubble gum.

Type 59 hefts the bag that is bulging with said bubblegum. Meanwhile, Type 80 can only look on in despair and resentment.

Type 80: This is bullying...

Type 59: Who was the one who said they were going to fight for a neural upgrade in the first place?

Type 59: Dammit, I only agreed to help you because you bribed me with dessert, but I can't halfass it anymore when I see you in this state.

Type 59: From now on, you will complete the entire Model Solder Training Program!

Type 59: ...Hey! Who gave you permission to lie down?!

Type 80: I'm going to die of exhaustion before I even get my neural upgrade.

Type 80: Isn't there a more chill training program out there?

Type 59: You... Alright, then.

Type 59: You wanted something more relaxing, right? I was planning to save it for the end considering the effect it might have on you.

Type 80: What is it?

Type 59: I call it the " Kindly Eyes Plan"!

Type 59: Very often, the reason why people keep their distance from you is because of your...uncanny eyes.

Type 59: As I recall, when you lost your glasses on the battlefield, your squad's teamwork efficiency ended up dropping. I'm fairly certain it's because of the way you were looking at them.

Type 80: Actually, these eyes were designed to intimidate enemy Dolls.

Type 80: However, it ends up being used more often on my friends, where it happens to be super effective...

Type 59: Did the person behind this design not consider the possibility that you might have Doll friends...?

Type 80: That's why I wear glasses to minimize their effect on people around me.

Type 59: But you haven't told anyone about this before, have you?

Type 59: At this rate, You're only going to grow more distant from your friends.

Type 59: Therefore, in order to prevent that from happening, you need to learn to look at your friends in a kinder way.

Type 59: You need to convey love and hope with your gaze!

Type 80: So you want me to take off my glasses and talk to people?

Type 80: Urgh, sounds like a drag... Ugh, forget I asked.

Type 59: So you're beating a retreat already?

Type 80: It's called a tactical advance to the rear.

Type 59: You're tactically advancing into your bed, more like! Get out of there at once!

Type 59: Don't waste MY hard work, if nothing else!

Type 80 in Her Blanket: Forget it, there's no hope for Type 80.

Type 80 in Her Blanket: She has no chance to be upgraded and no chance to be welcomed by others.

Type 80 in Her Blanket: And she definitely has no bubble gum.

Type 59: Bubble gum this, bubble gum that, all you know is bubble gum... Oh, that's it!

Type 59: Let's make a deal. If you complete your training, I'll give you a piece of bubble gum, how about that?

Type 80 In Her Blanket: ...

Type 59: And if you do well, I'll give you TWO pieces!

Type 80: Deal!

Type 59: That's the way.

Type 59: Come, take your glasses off.

Type 80: Okay.

Type 80: ...Well?

Type 59: Urgh... It-it's not too bad. At least I'm getting used to it now.

Type 59: ...

Type 80: Miss 59, why are you looking away?

Type 59: That's because...a plane just flew by outside, and I was looking at it!

Type 80: Oh, okay. Then can you look at me now?

Type 59: Of-of course I can.

Type 59: ...

Type 59: Maybe in five minutes' time?

Type 80: Miss...59...?

Type 63's Voice: Hey, 59, you in there?

Type 63's Voice: I just came back from a mission and Miss Springfield was telling me about how many cream puffs you stiffed her on. Did you really do that?

Type 59: Huh? You mean, from yesterday...?

Type 80: Oh yeah... I said it was going to be my treat yesterday, but I haven't paid up yet.

Type 59: That was all YOUR fault!

Type 80: Don't worry, I'll go settle the bill right now.

Type 59: Ah, your glasses!

Type 80: Is that Type 63? I'm going to go pay the bill...

Type 63: Ahhhhhhh it's a ghost—!

Before Type 80 can even make sure who she's talking to, Type 63 has already fled without a trace.

Type 80: ...

Type 59: Ohhhhh! That's pretty much a super power!

Type 59: If I had your eyes and I really did want to run out on my debts...

Type 80: Miss 59...

Type 59: Oh, ahem!

Type 59: This is just the beginning! Gain experience from your mistakes and learn from your setbacks! Feel your way forward and you can change yourself!

Type 80: ...I don't quite get it...but basically, all I need to do is greet people like I just did, right?

Type 59: Correct!

Type 59: Now go! Greet your friends and look at them with kindly eyes! Delicious bubblegum awaits!

Type 80: Alright, got it.

...

...

P7: Ahahahaha, somebody must have set off my glue trap!

...

P7: That's strange, the trap shouldn't have been THAT Strong. What's all this noise about?

P7 slowly emerges from around the corner and finds the source of the commotion is long gone.

Soon, a petite figure steps into the corridor, and upon seeing P7, she suddenly rushes over.

Type 80: Good afternoon, P7—!!! How are you today—???

P7: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

P7 tries to run, but she can't beat Type 80 in a full sprint.

In an instant, Type 80 has P7's head in her grasp, and she forces the latter to look her in the eye.

Type 80: Don't. Run. Away...

P7: I'm sorry I'm sorry I won't ever play pranks again!

Boom—!

Type 80: (Coughs heavily) Where did that smoke bomb come from?

Type 80: Are you alright, P...huh?

As the smoke clears, Type 80 finds that the only thing in her hands is P7's clothing.

P7 herself has vanished in a puff of smoke and run into the control room.

Type 80: This...

Type 59: Ahhh, I caught up with you at last!

Type 59: Did P7 drop that smoke bomb just now? I can't believe she was so scared she went for the alarm. Talk about over the top.

Type 59: Pay no attention to her. Including P7, you've scared 26 people off and made 7 more people faint. This is great!

Type 80: Is this something I should be happy about...?

Type 59: Look on the bright side, those cowardly Dolls would never be able to get used to your kindness.

Type 59: Didn't you see how Big Sis Thompson and Miss Groza took it in stride just now?

Type 80: But they looked like they were reaching for their guns, no?

Type 59: That doesn't matter! Go on, keep moving!

Type 80: No, I...I can't move any further.

Type 80: ...

Type 80: Oh yes, bubble gum, bubble gum!

Type 59: Huh? Now? But we haven't even finished our training yet!

Type 80: I can't do it, I'll die if I don't get any bubble gum!

Type 59: Stop rolling around on the ground!

Type 59: (Sighs) What am I going to do with you.

Type 59 takes out the packet of bubble gum, and upon hearing the sound of its contents, the light returns to Type 80's eyes.

...

Type 59: Hm, is the alarm not off yet?

Type 59: It feels like things are getting out of hand. If the patrol squads find out we did this, there'll be hell to pay. Let's head back to the dorm before I...

Type 59: Uwah!

Type 59, still holding the bag of gum, has not gone more than a few steps before her foot presses on a tripline, which dumps a bucket full of glue on her head.

—P7's handiwork.

Amidst her confusion, the bag of bubblegum falls out of her hands and onto the ground, where it is completely doused in glue.

Right after that, a cleaning robot just happens to pass by. It clears up all the "scattered rubbish" before sauntering off.

Type 80: ...

Type 80: ...

Type 80: BUB—BLE—GUM——!!!

In the Commander's office—

Type 59: ...

Type 80: ...

Commander: ...

Commander: So in order to help Type 80 secure a neural upgrade, you came up with a special training plan for her, Type 59?

Type 59: Hehehe, and it was going pretty well too...

Commander: Your definition of "pretty well" seems to be "causing chaos throughout the base".

Type 59: I'm sorry!

Commander: Still, it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage or losses... Well, other than Type 80's bubble gum.

Type 80: If it means I can get upgraded... I can bear with it.

Commander: I should point out that I can't arrange for neural upgrades as and when you want them.

Type 80: Huh? But-but I picked up so many shell casings...!

Commander: I'm sorry, but that is not one of the criteria for a neural upgrade.

Type 80: (Sniffles)

Commander: Still, I SHOULD have told you about the arrangements for your neural upgrade beforehand.

Type 80: ...

Type 80: Huh?

Type 59: Wait, do you mean Type 80...

Commander: Yup. Type 80 has a lot of room for improvement in combat, so we've already scheduled a neural upgrade for her a while back.

Commander: If you had caused a bigger disturbance than you did today, Miss Helian would probably have questioned my choice in candidates.

Type 80: This...this is great!

Type 80: Thank you, Commander!

Type 59: Wow...

Type 59: It would seem the training was a success after all.

Type 59: At this moment, Type 80's eyes have an adorable childlike gleam in them.
Part 4

Inside the base—

Makarov: Ah, I see. Not bad.

Type 59: You don't seem particularly excited about it.

Makarov: That's because you repeated it over ten times during the tea party. If I weren't so patient, I would have snuck off along with the rest of the others.

Type 59: But such a proud moment bears repeating.

Type 59: Type 80 got a neural upgrade, and it was thanks to me!

Type 59: That's a veteran for you, right? Isn't it amazing?

Makarov: Ah, I see. Not bad.

Type 59: Could you give me a different reaction already?!

Makarov: I will when you switch to a different topic.

Makarov: Let's call it a day, I need to head back to my dorm.

Type 59: Eh? You're leaving already?!

Makarov: Why not? You're not one of those Dolls who are scared of the dark, are you?

Type 59: Me? Scared of the dark?!

Type 59: Hahahaha, how could that be, I'm Type 59, the one who raised Type 80, the modified Doll!

Makarov: Oh good. Bye then.

Type 59: Aw, wait!

Makarov soon disappears down the end of the corridor, leaving Type 59 to face this inky-black passage by herself.

Type 59: Dammit, they finished Type 80's upgrade, so why haven't they fixed the lights yet?!

Nobody answers her.

Naturally, Type 59 doesn't feel like wasting any more time here, but just as she's about to take a step forward, a hand reaches out of the darkness and grabs her. And then, she can't breathe again.

Type 59: Help— Hm?

???: Shhhh—!

???: It's me!

Type 59: ...

Type 59: Okay, somehow I'm not that surprised anymore.

Type 80: You're here at last, Miss 59.

Type 59: Goodness, Type 80, that's a really good outfit You're wearing. Clothes make the man, as they say!

Type 59: ...

Type 59: ...So what are you up to?

Type 80: I need your help.

Type 59: What is it now? Are you going for another neural upgrade?

Type 59: As you know, there are no Dolls in Griffin who have been through two neural upgrades in a row, so you need to learn to be content...

Type 80: No, I want you to help me tell the Commander that I want to go back to how I was before.

Type 59: ...

Type 59: I'm sorry, maybe all the tea I've drunk today is clogging up my hearing module, but what did you just say?

Type 80: I want to go back to my original body!

Type 59: But why?! Are you not satisfied with your upgrade?!

Type 80: No, I'm quite happy with it.

Type 80: Being upgraded really does feel different, and the Commander was apparently really happy with my hard work, so they arranged lots of missions for me and I used the opportunity to make lots of friends...

Type 59: Isn't that a good thing?

Type 80: It's not bad, but... I've been given so many missions that they're taking up all my holidays.

Type 80: So I was thinking, maybe I could change back and enjoy my leisure time and I get upgraded again when I need to.

Type 59: ...You're insane, aren't you?

Type 80: I believe you can do it, Miss 59!

Type 59: That's impossible! Go talk to the Commander yourself!

Type 80: I don't care! Help me, Miss 59!

Type 59: Nooooooooooo!

Tonight, Type 59 braves her fear of darkness and returns to her dorm alone.

But it would seem that her nightmares are far from over...
