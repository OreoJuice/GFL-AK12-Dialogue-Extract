In a Griffin dorm.

M1911: Hmm... Our combat data this month are about the same as last month.

M1911: If I can improve them next month, I'm sure Darling would like that.

M9: What are you doing, M1911?

M1911: Analyzing our combat data this month.

M9: Oh? Let me see!

M1911: I'm not done yet. I'll send it out to all of you once it's ready.

M9: It doesn't hurt if I take a peek now, does it?

M9: You know what, I'm taking it myself!

M1911: Hey, don't just snatch it from me!

M1911: You're always so willful. The Commander might just get pissed off with you for that.

M9: The Commander is very fond of me. Whatever are you talking about?

M9: Hmm...let me look at this week's performance ranking...

M9: Ooooh! I ranked higher than you, M1911.

M1911: You merely out-damaged me a little.

M9: So you do realize how much shorter you measure up against me, eh?

M9: Then stop hanging around the Commander so much!

M1911: Pardon??

M9: You've been in service for quite a while now. Isn't it time you moved to the backline?

M9: Only new and glamorous T-Dolls like me are suited to be by the Commander's side.

M1911: You're only that much newer than myself!

M1911: Besides, I don't care about other things, but I won't easily let go of my Darling's love!

M1911: The position of the Commander's adjutant isn't determined by youth, but by performance.

M9: Humph. My performance is still better than yours!

Thompson: Don't be so sure about that, M9.

Thompson: No point in talking big before we have results from actual combat.

M9: M-Miss Thompson?! Since when...

Thompson: I just overheard you talking while passing by.

Thompson: Firepower is only part of your performance...

Thompson: You should at least understand that much if you're as mighty as you claim to be.

M9: Yes, ma'am...

M9: But Miss Thompson, I am better than M1911 in many things!

M9: You just have to let me prove it!

Thompson: I look forward to it.

Thompson: As for now, I think you should return to your room and wait for the official analysis to be completed.

M9 nods and leaves the common room.

M1911: Thanks for helping me out back there, Thompson. Sorry for the trouble.

Thompson: Don't mention it...

Thompson: Though even a softie like you should lose your temper every once in a while.

M1911: Well, well... That's not exactly my forte.

M1911: Besides, I AM an old model... Sometimes my body does betray me.

Thompson: So you're backing down?

M1911: Of course not!

M1911: How could I just let go after that romantic encounter with the Commander?

Thompson: Haha, thought so.

Thompson: Still, you gotta find a way to settle your dispute with M9...

Thompson: It this goes on, it could some day get in the way of our operation.

M1911: You're right, Thompson...

M1911: Maybe it's time I lost my temper.

In a Griffin dorm.

Thompson: This is a personal security mission assigned to us.

Thompson: We're to send a squad member to protect the Boss.

M9: And the Commander's bodyguard has to be...

Thompson: I'm leaving the Boss to M1911.

Thompson: The rest of you are on clean-up duty with me.

M1911: Okay. I'll escort my Darling to our destination without losing a single hair.

M9: What?!

M9: Why are you sending HER, Miss Thompson?

M1911: Because I'm the best candidate for protecting my Darling, of course!

M9: How is that possible?

M9: An old granny like you is obsolete! Only a rising star like me can protect the Commander!

M9: Please send me instead, Miss Thompson!

M9: I will escort the Commander to the destination without losing a single cell!

M1911: I'm gonna get angry for real if you call me old granny again, M9.

M1911: Compared to a little kid still wet behind her ears, a mature woman can better cater to all of the Commander's needs.

M9: Humph. So what if your boobs were stuffed with more fillings during manufacture?!

M9: It's not like I don't have boobs myself!

Thompson: Enough. We're going ahead with the original plan.

Thompson: If you two wanna settle the score, have some fun on the training ground. Just don't go overboard.

M9: Humph... Then I'll see you there, Old Granny!

M1911: Alright. I accept your challenge for the sake of my Darling.

Two hours later, on the training ground.

M1911: Bang! Game over, M9.

M9: D-dammit!

M9: Resorting to dirty tricks like throwing sand in my eyes... Come have a shoot-out with me if you dare!

M1911: Enemies on the field won't just stand there and have a square fight with you.

M1911: You must always keep a clear head and make the right calls...

M1911: You still have much to learn, sweetheart.

M9: Eww, don't call me that!

M9: Fine. You won this round...but I'll beat you next time!

M1911: ...Being piqued won't make you improve, M9.

M1911: If you want, I can help you analyze your combat data.

M9: I'll do it myself! I don't need to be patronized by an old granny!

M9: Don't let it get to your head either...

M9: You may be standing next to the Commander this time, but I'll definitely snatch the position back!

M1911: Yeah, yeah, I know.

M1911: You should also remember...that I won't lose to you in terms of my love for my Darling.

M9 turns and stalks off angrily.

Thompson: Looks like your problem hasn't really been solved, 1911.

M1911: But it should subside for the time being.

M1911: Sigh...it's pretty tiring locking horns with little kids...

Thompson: Indeed. Things would be much easier if everyone can settle differences reasonably.

M1911: Still, M9 is pretty strong.

M1911: I made it look easy, but to be honest, it was a close fight...

Thompson: Then you'd better work harder, 1911.

Thompson: Or you'll really end up being looked down on by the young ones.

M1911: I know, Thompson.

M1911: I really should start thinking about my future.

M1911: If I don't make any progress, I'll be left behind by my Darling.

A month later, during a confrontation between Squad Thompson and Sangvis forces.

M9: 1911! You still can't get in touch with Miss Thompson?

M1911: She seems pretty busy herself so we're on our own.

M9: You make it sound like it's no big deal!

M9: We're running out of ammo, we can't contact our squad leader, and we're surrounded by enemies... What do we do?!

M1911: Aren't you an elite of the new age, M9?

M1911: Is this enough to make you freak out?

M9: Damn old granny... Is this really the time to be snide?

M9: When we use up our last magazine, we can huddle in this corner and wait for our kingdom come...

M9: At least I've backed up my neural cloud. Hopefully I won't lose too much memory.

M1911: Giving up already?

M1911: And here I was looking forward to your death throes...

M9: Hey, what are you talking aboutâ€”

M1911: Heheh...

M1911: Can't be helped. Let the seasoned vet deal with this crisis.

M9: You have an idea?

M1911: Of course. After all, a new body costs quite a lot...

M1911: Spending our bounty on that is such a waste. I'd rather save it for something that'll make my Darling love me even more.

M9: H-hold on! The Commander isn't yours alone!

M1911: Then come with me.

M1911: If you want to fight with me over the Commander, you'll have to wait till we complete the mission.

Half an hour later.

The gas station in the distance explodes all of a sudden.

...

M9: Alright, we made a scene around the abandoned gas station...

M9: But are you sure S.F. will go check it out?

M1911: Without an advanced Ringleader around, these units aren't too smart.

M1911: Besides, we also blew up a few Sangvis units over there. They're bound to divert some troops to investigate.

M9: I sure hope so...

M9: I donated my last magazine. If we run into more enemy...

M9: I only have enough bullets left to blast my neural cloud to bits.

M1911: Pffft, don't be so melodramatic. We're very likely to make it out.

M1911: Now let's regroup with Thompson and the others.

M1911 and M9 reach the side of the motorway.

M9: The Sangvis patrols really seem to be gone.

M1911: Then let's make our away through quickly.

M1911: They'll be back soon once they realize nobody's there.

M9: Got it.

An hour later, the two arrive at the rendezvous point.

Thompson: What took you so long, M1911?

Thompson: If you were late by another ten minutes, you'd have to make your own way home.

M1911: Sorry about that, Thompson.

M1911: We ran into some trouble on the way and we're out of ammo.

M1911: We were lucky the Sangvis encirclement wasn't exactly watertight and managed to crawl our way out.

M9: Making a popular T-Doll like me crawl in the dirt, getting all filthy...

Thompson: Haha, at least you made it out alive.

Thompson: Now let's go. Tell me about your little adventure on our way home.

At the Griffin base.

M1911: Jeez...that was exhausting.

M1911: I need to catch some sleep.

M9: Um, M1911...

M1911: Hmm?

M9: Thank you for today... If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have made it back.

M9: And I was only calling you an old granny out of pique... Sorry about that...

M1911: You did your best to help out on our retreat so I forgive you.

M1911: But only this time. If you call me that again, that'll be a whole new tab.

M9: Humph! Of course!

M9: I may be apologizing, but that doesn't mean I'm letting you have the Commander!

M1911: Oh, what a shame. You'll lose painfully.

M1911: I'm a lot more determined than you think.

M9: Humph. You think I'd be scared of you?

M1911: No, but I look forward to our next fight.

M1911: Then...

M1911: Be prepared to lose against me as my rival!

Griffin Control.

M1911: Hi, Darling!

M1911: I'm here to deliver our mission report.

Commander: Ah, M1911...

Commander: Oh?!

Commander: You look...

M1911: This is my new build. You're the first to see it, Darling.

M1911: Well? How do you like it?

Commander: Hmm, very nice.

Commander: You look a lot more youthful than before...

M1911: Does that mean...I looked old?

Commander: Ah...umm...of course not!

Commander: Ahem, anyway...it's definitely an improvement in all aspects.

M1911: Haha, I know... I was just messing with you.

M1911: I must work harder to keep myself useful to you.

M1911: If I stop making progress, I will eventually turn into the "old granny" that they enjoy calling me so much.

Commander: That's good.

Commander: With that attitude, you will never be obsolete.

M1911: I can feel your love, Darling. I'm sure this will further improve my combat effectiveness.

M1911: Allow me to continue our fateful partnership in my new form.

M1911: M1911 will always stay faithfully by your side, Darling!
