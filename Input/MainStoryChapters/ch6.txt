Area S08, Sangvis Ferri territory, five days after AR-15's disappearance.

Negev: Hello, my commander. This is Negev.

Negev: My current location is Zone T6, Area S08. A recon squad has discovered AR-15 in the vicinity.

Negev: This area is pretty expansive, so on top of the AR Team, my squad has also joined in on the search.

Negev: But since we are dispatched on short notice and aren't familiar with the field, I'm counting on you to clear the way for us.

Negev: As you see, this is an area on Sangvis territory where some of the worst conflicts had taken place.

Negev: The enemy has more influence here, so even an experienced commander like you should best be careful.

Squad Negev reached their destination.

Negev: We've arrived. There's a Griffin base here.

Negev: I'll stay and watch the radar. Galil, stand guard in the back.

Galil: Got it. Leave it to me.

Negev: Tavor, have you started looking for clues?

TAR-21: Not yet, I'm still checking my equipment.

Negev: I told you to turn it on beforehand. It doesn't eat much battery anyway.

TAR-21: It doesn't hurt to save whatever I can. After all, we'll be moving into our new dorm once we go back. We should make it a good start.

Negev: Up to you. But we can't rest until we find AR-15, you hear?

TAR-21: Still, why is Helian wasting so much effort just to find a so-called 'traitor'?

Negev: She's just unlucky enough to be planted with the Parapluie program. That's how she leaked the location of our secret base without even knowing.

Negev: She probably ran off out of guilt. She must understand her own position very well to be able to do that.

Negev: In any case, our job is to find her, and 16Lab will try to recover her.

TAR-21: Parapluie... Is it really the Parapluie program that she's been planted with?

TAR-21: If it's just some data leakage, it doesn't sound as terrible as they say...

TAR-21: But is there any point in letting a T-Doll that has made such a mistake live?

Negev: The T-Dolls on the AR Team are all developed and produced by 16Lab. We need to show them some due respect.

Negev: And their neural clouds are rather different than ours. If they die, it's really game over for them.

Negev: Let's report the situation of this base to the commander first and request for more reinforcement.

TAR-21: ...

Negev: What is it, Tavor?

TAR-21: Strange... I think something's wrong with my comms module.

TAR-21: No good... It's completely down.

Negev: (Sighs) That's why you should turn your equipment on frequently to check them. It really doesn't take that much bat...

Negev: Although I guess...it isn't a problem with the equipment this time...

Negev: Am I right, Sangvis lady?

??: ...

Negev: Tavor, now!

...!!

TAR-21: The target has withdrawn from the base. We're safe for now!

Negev: That's 'Alchemist'. She's a tricky one! Keep an eye on your surroundings!

Alchemist: Heheh... Such a shame...

Alchemist: I could've caressed that lovely throat of yours in another three seconds.

Negev: So you're the one jamming our signal?

Alchemist: Well... That really has nothing to do with me.

Alchemist: I just came all the way here hungrily following the scent given off by fresh and tender fruit.

Alchemist: If you want to find out more... I can tell you slowly as I tear your bodies into shreds!

Negev: Tavor, smoke grenade!

Negev: Guys, defend this base to the death! Don't let Sangvis troops anywhere near!

Negev: (Whispers) I'm counting the rest on you, Galil...

Alchemist: Hahahahahahahaha!

Alchemist: I don't see the point in fighting to such bitter end, but this is always the best!

Alchemist: Keep struggling. When your despair is at its ripest, I'll savor you one bite at a time!

Border of T7, Area S08, several minutes later.

M16A1: We're here.

M16A1: This is where a member of Squad Negev sent out the distress signal.

M16A1: SOP-II, test the comms.

M4 SOPMOD II: Communication signal functioning as usual. We're already connected to the commander's channel.

M4 SOPMOD II: M4, go on and call the commander.

M4A1: It has been a while, Commander.

M4A1: Negev's search team entered this zone and lost contact with us 20 minutes ago.

M4A1: But we picked up a member's distress signal just now.

M4A1: Our mission is to rendezvous with this member and determine the situation.

M4 SOPMOD II: Geez. And here I thought we finally got some help. Turns out they're only dragging us down...

M16A1: If even Negev ran into trouble, we wouldn't have come off any better if it had been us.

M16A1: Commander, please help us reach our destination. Thanks man.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

The AR Team arrived at the destination.

Galil: Hey! Hey, AR Team! I'm over here!

M4A1: Relax, Galil. You are safe now.

Galil: Phew... Thanks a bunch. A few more minutes and Sangvis would've got me.

M16A1: Of all the places you could call for help, you just had to pick an open battlefield full of Sangvis forces...

Galil: Well... Communication with Griffin is jammed where we got ambushed.

Galil: I ran for ages before I finally found somewhere with signal. It's not like I was spoiled for choice, you know.

M4 SOPMOD II: Can you explain what exactly happened?

Galil: When we were investigating the base where AR-15 had stayed, Negev noticed a Sangvis Ringleader hiding in ambush.

Galil: She gestured for me to slip out and call for help while the enemy was still busy deploying her forces.

Galil: I only realized there was a signal jam when I was running out. God knows what's going on over there now...

M16A1: What should we do, M4? We can't fight off a Ringleader in Sangvis territory on our own.

M16A1: But we probably don't have time to retreat and ask the commander for help, right?

M4A1: ...We split up.

M4A1: M16, contact the commander and guide the troops in aiding us.

M4A1: Galil, take me and SOP-II to the base. We will stir up their forces from the rear and draw some fire away from Negev.

Griffin Control, Area S08, several minutes later.

M16A1: Commander, that's the situation over here.

M16A1: The local Sangvis Ringleader has Negev's search team surrounded.

M16A1: M4 and SOP-II are off to their rescue, but they can't hold the enemy off for long.

M16A1: Comms signal is jammed in that zone. We could force our way through and rescue them, but there is a safer way.

M16A1: There's a Sangvis command post here that seems to be in charge of directing a number of their units.

M16A1: And we're in luck - signal is normal around this command post, so you can direct our troops to take over it.

M16A1: Then we can use it to confuse the enemy, which should make things much easier for M4 and the others.

M16A1: So that's the idea, Commander. If you think it'll work, let's go.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Griffin troops successfully occupied the Sangvis command post.

...Click.

Negev: Calling M16! M16, are you there?

Negev: Sangvis has retreated. We're safe now!

M16A1: Huh? Negev, is that you? Is the signal back to normal?

Negev: Yeah, Tavor noticed it just now. No idea why.

M16A1: What about M4 and the others? Have you met up with them?

Negev: Huh...? They were here just now. M4 and SOP-II...

Galil: Negev, bad news!

Galil: M4 and SOP-II just ran off!

Galil: And I'm not reading their signals! It must be the jam again!

TAR-21: I'm sorry. It was my fault.

TAR-21: I noticed a figure hovering in the distance when the battle was over.

TAR-21: I didn't think and just pointed it out to SOP-II, but I did tell her not to do anything reckless.

TAR-21: In the end, they still slipped off in pursuit.

M16A1: TAR-21, was the figure you saw...

TAR-21: Yes...

TAR-21: It was none other than AR-15...

Meanwhile, M4A1 and SOPMOD II...

M4A1: Found anything, SOP-II?

M4 SOPMOD II: Not yet. I definitely saw her...

M4 SOPMOD II: Dammit! It should be around here!

M4A1: Our signal is still being jammed. We must not go too far. Retreat when things do not look right.

M4 SOPMOD II: Why is she hiding from us...

??: Because you...keep causing me trouble.

Thud...

M4A1 turns around at the sound and finds M4 SOPMOD II lying on the ground, unconscious...

M4A1: SOP-II! Wake up! Answer me!

ST AR-15: M16 has mentioned this ambush technique so many times, but you're still so unprepared.

ST AR-15: What will you do without me?

M4A1: Why, AR-15...?

M4A1: What on earth...are you doing...?

AR-15 raises her weapon at M4A1...

ST AR-15: I'm putting on...a touching scene of reunion.

...

Griffin Control, Area S08, several minutes later.

M16A1: Commander, sorry but I have bad news to report.

M16A1: We have lost contact with M4A1 and SOP-II while they were pursuing AR-15...

Negev: Hey, M16, Commander! Are you there?!

Negev: We just discovered SOP-II's whereabouts!

M16A1: Huh? Are their comms back on?

Negev: Not sure. We're only reading SOP-II's signal. No news of M4 yet.

Negev: And SOP-II hasn't been responding to our calls either.

Negev: In any case, I'm sending you her coordinates!

Negev: This area isn't very far from the base, but a large amount of Sangvis units came surging in just now.

M16A1: What? Is Alchemist making a comeback?

Negev: No idea, but it doesn't really look like it...

Negev: First of all, the numbers are too great. Commanding this many units is beyond Alchemist's authorization level.

Negev: Secondly, their movements...seem kinda chaotic. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective either.

M16A1: If they aren't directed at us, then we don't have to be too worried for now.

M16A1: Let's report to Helian and ask her to consult the database for any plausible Ringleader suspect.

Negev: That's precisely my plan. But you guys be careful too.

Negev: The commander's troops must break through here to get to SOP-II.

Negev: Luckily, signal is now back to normal, so the commander can direct our forces into the area.

M16A1: Understood, Negev.

M16A1: Commander, please move with caution. Off we go to SOP-II's rescue!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

M16A1 reached the destination and started searching for M4 SOPMOD II.

M16A1: ...SOP-II!

M16A1: SOP-II, are you okay? Wake up!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ugh... M16? Is that you?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hmm... Uhh... Where's M4...

M16A1: I thought you knew. You're the only one I saw when I got here.

M16A1: Here, get up. What the hell happened?!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hmm...

M4 SOPMOD II: She was with me just now... We were looking for AR-15, until...

M16A1: You got ambushed? Who was it, do you remember?

M4 SOPMOD II: I can't possibly...forget...

M4 SOPMOD II: M16, I just don't understand...

Negev: Hey, M16! You guys still there?!

M16A1: Yeah... I just met up with SOP-II, but...

Negev: Listen. We just reported everything to Helian, and she thinks something's really off.

Negev: She advices us to abort the mission of finding AR-15 and withdraw from the area for the time being.

Negev: Do you copy, M16? We are in grave danger right now.

Negev: Inform the commander ASAP! We're moving out of Area S08, leaving no one behind!

Meanwhile...

...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Hey, you. You up yet?

M4A1: Who...are you?

ST AR-15: Me...?

ST AR-15: I'm here to pick you up.

M4A1: Pick me up me? ...For what?

ST AR-15: Just how dumb are you...

ST AR-15: To bring you to meet the others.

ST AR-15: Your friends. They're waiting for you.

M4A1: Friends?

M4A1: No one matches the definition of 'friend' in my memory module.

M4A1: Does that mean...I have no friends yet?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: In that case, I'm your first friend.

ST AR-15: Argh... This sucks...

...

M4A1: Ugh...

ST AR-15: You up yet?

M4A1: AR...15...

M4A1: Where...are we...?

ST AR-15: An abandoned control center. No one knows about this place.

ST AR-15: I'm just gonna ask you some questions. Answer them truthfully.

M4A1: AR-15, I know you must have a very good reason for doing this, right?!

M4A1: What has Alchemist done with me?! What is the deal with the signal jam?!

ST AR-15: Answer my questions. That's the only thing you can do now.

ST AR-15: Question one, Just now... You had a dream, a dream about the past.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Yes, it was a memory fragment. I could see, and I could hear...

ST AR-15: Question two, What was it about?

M4A1: I think it was the first time...I was awakened...

M4A1: I heard your voice. You made me open my eyes...

ST AR-15: Then...last question. Answer me truthfully.

ST AR-15: M4A1...Who are you?

M4A1: ...??

M4A1: What...do you mean...?

ST AR-15: Answer me, M4.

ST AR-15: I'm fighting for everyone's survival here...

ST AR-15: Yours, the commander's, Griffin's...

ST AR-15: So hurry up and answer me, M4A1.

ST AR-15: ...Who exactly are you?

Griffin Control, Area S08.

Negev: Commander! Commander, do you copy?

Negev: Information from various sources all indicate Sangvis forces are congregating in this direction.

Negev: HQ has issued directives for all Griffin troops to withdraw from this area until further notice.

Negev: However, our squad got intercepted by Sangvis troops while we were making our retreat.

Negev: Granted, I'd love nothing more than a bloodbath, but it's better to exercise caution for now.

Negev: So please, Commander. I'll have to trouble you to lend us a hand.

Negev: Our base is right here. Thank you, and please hurry!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Combat over. Squad Negev safe for the time being.

Negev: Phew... Finally, it's over.

Negev: Thanks, Commander. We've troubled you many times already.

Negev: But this area is still filled with Sangvis forces. Don't let down your guard, guys.

Galil: Hey... Has any of you seen M16?

Galil: She should've collected SOP-II long ago, right? Why isn't she back yet?

TAR-21: She must've got information on M4 or AR-15 and didn't want us to get involved?

Negev: Dammit! All these rule breakers!

Negev: Turn on your comms and search for them!

TAR-21: Sorry... I'm not reading any of their signals.

TAR-21: Seriously... It's so dangerous here. She should've moved out the moment she realized comms are being jammed...

Negev: ...

Negev: Unless...the jam happens to be what she's after...

Meanwhile...

...

ST AR-15: In that case, I'm your first friend.

ST AR-15: Argh... This sucks.

M4A1: You are...AR-15?

ST AR-15: Oh? You know me?

M4A1: Your firearm...matches the description of T-Doll AR-15's in my memory module.

ST AR-15: Is that so...

M4A1: You do not...seem very happy?

ST AR-15: I'm not unhappy.

ST AR-15: Making friends with you is the first order I was given. Displaying enthusiasm is also part of the order.

M4A1: But...if you are happy, should you not smile?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Then order me to smile. Give me an order, and I'll do it.

M4A1: You want me to...give you an order?

ST AR-15: Give me an order. Order me to do whatever you want me to do.

ST AR-15: This is your prerogative, M4A1. Everything is prepared for your sake.

M4A1: ...

...

M4A1: This is...my memory?

??: Yes, M4A1 of Griffin.

??: This is your very first memory.

M4A1: Who are you?! What are you doing?!

??: Looking for the answer to the question just now.

??: The answer to the question...of who you really are.

M4A1: I am a T-Doll under the employment of Griffin and a member of the AR Team.

M4A1: Other than that, I do not know how else to answer.

??: Sure enough, the memory in your neural cloud completely mirrors that of AR-15.

??: But this isn't what I want. So c'mon, tell me the answer.

M4A1: I told you. I do not know...

??: How can you not know the reason you were made?

??: Tell me! C'mon, tell me!

M4A1: I do not know!

M4A1: I don't know the freaking answer! You jerk! Freak!

M4A1: Who the hell are you?! Leave me alone!!

??: Why are you angry?

??: Why can't you treat me nicely like everyone else?

ST AR-15: ...Because she really doesn't know the answer.

ST AR-15: The neural clouds of the AR Team members have all been encrypted by 16Lab. Many files are not accessible even to ourselves.

ST AR-15: Looks like the information regarding M4 is one of them. I can't read them even through Parapluie...

??: ...In other words, you've failed to bring me information about M4A1.

??: You've broken your end of the deal, AR-15 of Griffin...

ST AR-15: I told you right from the start that this most likely won't work...

Clap! Clap!

??: ...I despise oath breakers.

??: Go, Alchemist. The authorization is now yours.

??: Take M4A1. The rest is dispensable.

Alchemist: You hear that, AR-15?

Alchemist: You have M4A1 with you, right? Then we'll meet very soon...

Alchemist: At long last, I can do you in with my own hands!

ST AR-15: Alchemist...

ST AR-15: Don't get ahead of yourself, you won't get what you want so easily.

Alchemist: But you have nowhere else to go, AR-15...

Alchemist: You know that better than anyone else, right? As the first experimental subject of Plan Parapluie, and...

Alchemist: ...The source of this signal jam.

Alchemist: Before long, you'll regret not delivering M4A1 to us while you can...

Alchemist: Soon...

Click.

M16A1: Commander? Negev? Are you there?!

Negev: M16, where the hell are you?!

Negev: Sangvis forces are everywhere in Area S08, and they're insanely strong!

Negev: We almost retreated without you!

M16A1: Sorry, I got held up by something.

M16A1: Listen, Negev, Commander. Ignore everything else.

M16A1: Alchemist's troops have started mobilizing. I'm afraid they're going straight for you.

Negev: Humph. So it's time to settle the score?

Negev: What about you? Where are you and SOP-II going?

M16A1: We have our own arrangement. We can handle it. Don't worry about us.

M16A1: You guys be careful. Commander, keep Negev and the others safe!

Negev: Hey! M16! Hello?!

Alchemist: Morning, everyone from Griffin.

Alchemist: The hunt is about to begin. Are you ready?

Alchemist: And I very much look forward to seeing you again, Miss Negev...

Negev: Oh really? But I'm hella pissed right now, Alchemist...

Negev: You'd better pray you won't run into me, especially not while I still have a breath left in me...

Alchemist: Oh? How long will you last with your antique rounds?

Alchemist: Now let me guess. Are you gonna get shredded along with your little friends, or keel over as you run away on your own?

Alchemist: Paint your face with the sweetest kind of fear and let me have a taste!

Negev: Suits me just fine, Sangvis scumbag...

Negev: Let's get this fight started, Commander.

Negev: There's nothing more riveting than guzzling the blood of your enemy.
Part 2

Three hours after the retreat commenced...

...Click.

M16A1: Negev... Negev...!

M16A1: Our carrier is here! Hurry!

M16A1: Sangvis is right behind you, and the building is about to blow!

M16A1: Quick, everyone run! Hurry!

...

M4A1: Ugh...

M16A1: Finally awake, M4?

M16A1: Can you walk on your own? Hurry, our carrier is here!

M4A1: M16...

M4A1: Why...is it you?

M16A1: Why would it not be me? Isn't it always me?

M4A1: I mean...

M4A1: AR-15...

M4A1: Where is AR-15?! Where is she?!

M16A1: She...

M16A1: She made her choice...

...

A horrible, irrepressible gut feeling pierced me again.

M4A1: No...

M4A1: No! There must be some mistake!

M4A1: AR-15... She... She wants to...

M16A1: Hey, M4! What are you doing?!

M16A1: M4! Where are you going?! Come back here! Stay away from that building!

...

I ran off the aircraft and dashed into a scene of chaos.

The building collapsing in the midst of a deafening explosion... Friendly T-Dolls scrambling around in panic... Sangvis pursuers being buried in rubble...

And I knew what it meant...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...A...R...15...

M4A1: W...Why...

That was a cacophonous funeral...

...And a silent farewell.

Alchemist: Oh? How long will you last with your antique rounds?

Alchemist: Now let me guess. Are you gonna get shredded along with your little friends, or keel over as you run away on your own?

Alchemist: Paint your face with the sweetest kind of fear and let me have a taste!

One hour into the operation. Squad Negev is surrounded by Sangvis troops and in dire situation.

Galil: Dammit... It's as if we've kicked a hornet's nest! They just keep swarming at us!

Galil: Since when were there so many Sangvis units in Area S08?!

TAR-21: This is abnormal. Commanding this many units is far beyond the capability of a regular Ringleader.

TAR-21: Alchemist could just be a bait to lure us into this trap...

Galil: Whatever the case, we're not gonna last long!

Galil: Negev, order us to fall back!

Galil: ...Negev? Negev, do you copy?!

TAR-21: Negev's signal has vanished. She must've gone within the Parapluie jam.

TAR-21: She's out for blood. Looks like we're on our own again...

TAR-21: Commander, are you listening? We've temporarily lost contact with Negev so we need your help.

TAR-21: Please fend off these Sangvis interceptors and cover our retreat.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Combat over. Squad Negev successfully retreated from the zone of danger.

TAR-21: We're finally out of the lions' den. Thank you very much for your help, Commander.

Galil: But what about Negev? We can't just leave her in there alone.

M16A1: She's not alone. SOP-II from our team is also in there.

M16A1: Two suicidal nuts sticking together should have a better chance of surviving, I guess...

TAR-21: Glad you're okay, M16.

TAR-21: So what should we do now?

TAR-21: Things aren't going well for Griffin, are they?

M16A1: That's an understatement... Sangvis forces of this size and that signal jam. Anyone who made it out should count herself lucky.

M16A1: There simply are too many to rescue. Let's do what we can for now...

M16A1: And leave whatever's in there to the battle maniacs.

Meanwhile, on the transport route in Area S08.

Alchemist: What's the matter, AR-15? Still as a statue, aren't you?

Alchemist: If you don't leave, many of your friends won't make it out either.

Alchemist: Well? Are you going to tell me where you've hidden M4?

ST AR-15: Alchemist, what...have you done...

Alchemist: Me? I merely provoked and misled a few of your squads.

Alchemist: They thought I was the one in charge of the entire attack and just made a beeline at me.

Alchemist: Now all I have to do is trap you here at this crucial pass...

ST AR-15: And their comms will be jammed, leaving them helplessly isolated...

Alchemist: It'll only take the blink of an eye to destroy these pathetic toys with my troops...

Alchemist: But I've given you all this time to weigh your options...

Alchemist: Give me M4A1's location, or watch me tear your friends to pieces, one by one.

ST AR-15: ...Don't try to guilt-trip me, Alchemist. Threats won't work either.

ST AR-15: Protecting M4 is my order. I will never bow to my enemies!

Alchemist: Hahaha! I love idiots like you. Your existence is what makes my world so beautiful!

Alchemist: You think the execution is gonna be quick? You think I'll be satisfied with such a short feast?

Alchemist: While you're stubbornly standing by your beliefs, more and more Griffin T-Dolls are coming here to die in vain!

ST AR-15: Do whatever you want, Alchemist. I don't care what form of cruelty you want to unleash...

ST AR-15: Just remember. No matter what you do...

ST AR-15: ...Only one of us will walk out of this alive.

Helian: M16, tell me what happened in the field!

Helian: I already gave the order to retreat, so why are there so many units still in there?!

M16A1: They're stuck in front of a pass, and the signal is jammed there.

M16A1: There are Sangvis forces lying in ambush everywhere. Forcing our way through from either side will result in severe losses!

Helian: Parapluie is still in effect? Why didn't AR-15 leave?

M16A1: She's probably being pinned down by the Ringleader...

M16A1: It's also this Alchemist's idea to provoke Negev...

Helian: The cunning type, huh... My investigation failed to reflect that.

Helian: Then our most pressing mission is to get AR-15 out of her tight spot?

M16A1: Yes, so we've come up with a plan just now...

M16A1: Commander, do you copy?

M16A1: We're planning to send SOP-II across the field and into the jam.

M16A1: She will direct everyone in there to follow the right route of evacuation.

M16A1: But you will have to destroy the Sangvis forces on the outside to create a window for SOP-II to pass through.

M16A1: Commander, the safety of AR-15, M4A1, and all other Griffin members...

M16A1: All rest on you. Please complete this mission without fail!

Meanwhile, on the transport route in Area S08.

Alchemist: It's all over, AR-15...

Alchemist: Creatures on the brink of death...should just stop struggling.

ST AR-15: You're not...in much better shape yourself...

ST AR-15: Your forces on the outside have been wiped out by our commander. It's just a matter of time for Griffin units to make it out.

Alchemist:

Alchemist: Humph. But M4A1 is the only one I'm after...

Alchemist: Perhaps it's about time you handed her over if you don't want me to execute you because I run out patience.

ST AR-15: Alchemist... You seem to have overlooked one thing...

ST AR-15: I never said...that I had M4A1 with me...

Alchemist: ...?!

Alchemist: I see... I see!

Alchemist: Hahahahahahaha!

Alchemist: You sure are fascinating, AR-15!

Alchemist: Wonderful! Such heinous and underhanded treachery is exactly the kind of romance I seek!

Alchemist: Pity...that it'll be over soon...

Alchemist: An execution with only you present, no matter the form, is a bit of a bore...

M4 SOPMOD II: What about some audience?

...!

M4 SOPMOD II: Keep talking, freak! Keep gloating!

M4 SOPMOD II: Say something, you bitch! Don't think you can die just like that!

ST AR-15: Stop it, SOP-II. Don't waste time on a corpse.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ha... Sorry. Things have been so tense I lost it a little...

ST AR-15: (Sighs) That's very like you...

ST AR-15: If you hadn't, I'd have thought you're a dummy.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

...

ST AR-15: Hey, stop squeezing me so tight! I still have injuries on me!

M4 SOPMOD II: I finally get to see you again, AR-15...

ST AR-15: Why are you freaking out so much? It's not like I'd die...

ST AR-15: More importantly, how did you find me?

ST AR-15: M16 gave you some suicidal ideas again, didn't she?

M4 SOPMOD II: This is the battlefield. Everything we do is a risk, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Parapluie can't cut off every kind of connection, AR-15...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...As long as we want to see you.

ST AR-15: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Don't worry. The squads trapped by Alchemist have already started evacuating.

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's get out of here first. We'll think about where to settle you after making sure the way is clear.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Sorry. I can't go back just like this...

ST AR-15: Take this drive. All the information I've collected is in there, including M4's hideout...

ST AR-15: As well as...the things I want to say to you all...

M4 SOPMOD II: AR-15... What are you talking about?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's okay! I'll move you somewhere safe and 16Lab will come up with something!

M4 SOPMOD II: Helian said the Parapluie outbreak wasn't your fault so you won't be punished too badly.

ST AR-15: That's not the problem, SOP-II...

ST AR-15: You don't understand just how terrifying the situation is. Alchemist was just an insignificant enforcer...

ST AR-15: If we don't stop the one behind the whole thing, Sangvis Ferri will consume everyone here!

M4 SOPMOD II: The enemy hiding behind the scenes...

M4 SOPMOD II: Do we really not stand a chance against her?

ST AR-15: Not in our current state, no...

ST AR-15: So I must go and meet her. This is the only way of saving everyone.

M4 SOPMOD II: AR-15... Are you blaming yourself for what happened here...?

ST AR-15: I'm stating facts, SOP-II. I'm not doing this out of shame or guilt...

ST AR-15: I promise I'll find a solution, so please, you can't stop me.

ST AR-15: It's for you, for M16 and M4A1, for everyone here...

M4 SOPMOD II: Then promise me...that you won't do anything stupid...

M4 SOPMOD II: Can you promise me that, AR-15?!

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I'm doing what must be done.

ST AR-15: Hurry, SOP-II. Get out of the jam.

ST AR-15: M4 is still waiting for you. Protect her. I'm counting on you...

M4 SOPMOD II: She...

M16A1: SOP-II, what's the matter? Where's AR-15?

M4 SOPMOD II: She said...

M4 SOPMOD II: There's something she must do...

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't know what she means... It...scares me...

M16A1: ...

M16A1: Understood, SOP-II.

M16A1: But right now, we have our own duty, too, so let's focus on that for now...

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, we destroyed Alchemist...

M4 SOPMOD II: Has the Sangvis attack...weakened?

M16A1: ...Yes, their units are now scrambling around like bugs and no longer seem to be targeting us.

M16A1: Signal along the transport route has also returned to normal, and the remaining T-Dolls have started retreating.

M16A1: All that's left is M4. You know where she is?

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah... AR-15 has given me M4's location. I'm on my way to look for her.

M16A1: All right. Cheer up and leave the rest to me.

M16A1: Commander, we have a new mission.

M16A1: SOP-II is off to rescue M4A1. We need to give them cover.

M16A1: Sangvis forces are still strong as ever in that area, so we have to break through by force.

M16A1: Dispatch your forces, Commander.
Part 2

Combat over. SOP-II proceeds to M4's hideout.

...

......

M4A1: ...No.

M4A1: I forfeit this order.

M4A1: This...is not what friends should be.

ST AR-15: If you want me to be that kind of friend, you'll have to order me.

M4A1: ...I will keep waiting. Until the day you willingly do so.

M4A1: This is what you owe me, AR-15. I will keep on waiting...

...

Meanwhile, outside an abandoned building.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: The last of the gang finally shows herself...

ST AR-15: As always, you're such a foreboding presence...

ST AR-15: ...M16A1.

M16A1: I must see you one last time while I can still afford the risk...

M16A1: I'll knock you out and drag you back if that's what it takes.

ST AR-15: I'm sorry for screwing things up, but please don't get in my way. This is my own business.

M16A1: At least tell me what you know, AR-15.

M16A1: What on earth have you been through all this time...?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I'd been digging around the Sangvis database for the last couple of days, trying to uncover the truth behind Plan Parapluie.

ST AR-15: While investigating a Sangvis factory, I accidentally set off a signal disruptor.

ST AR-15: I had a dream again that night. Then I woke up and realized comms were completely down.

M16A1: Was it caused by the disruptor? Did it somehow trigger your Parapluie program?

ST AR-15: Yes. Now that I think about it, the disruptor probably installed a jamming module on Parapluie...

ST AR-15: I lost all means of communication and didn't want to drag Griffin into this mess. That's why I went into hiding here in Area S08.

ST AR-15: Then the series of events...ensued...

M16A1: It wasn't your fault, AR-15.

M16A1: If it hadn't been for the information you left behind, none of us would even have known that's Plan Parapluie.

ST AR-15: I got careless. Then I lost my cool and couldn't think of a way to fix my mistake. That's how Griffin ended up in this pitiful state...

ST AR-15: I handed everything I've learned over to SOP-II in the hope that it can salvage the situation, even for just a little...

M16A1: Don't despair just yet, AR-15! Things are still salvageable!

M16A1: With Alchemist out of the picture, Sangvis forces are already in complete disarray!

M16A1: Look at their units - scrambling around like bugs! They're effectively leaderless!

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: You know nothing, M16.

ST AR-15: The confusion among the enemies' ranks isn't the result of Alchemist's demise...

ST AR-15: Rather, it's caused by the staggering rage of their actual leader, who's hellbent on destroying us!

ST AR-15: ...Well, all of us except M4A1.

M16A1: So you're off to find them? What good will that do?

M16A1: If you're going, at least take me along!

ST AR-15: I've learned a few things from Negev, including their location, the forces stationed in that area...

ST AR-15: And...the number of friendly T-Dolls that need rescuing there.

ST AR-15: I'm leaving them to you, M16.

M16A1: So, you're playing the hero on your own?

M16A1: You'll only end up getting caught without achieving anything!

ST AR-15: No, I won't. At least...they won't catch me alive.

AR-15 displays a small switch.

M16A1: A detonator of high explosives...? Where did you get it?

ST AR-15: Negev gave it to me. I rigged the explosives under the building.

ST AR-15: I'll have no regrets dragging this many Sangvis units to hell with me...

M16A1: What are you talking about, AR-15?!

M16A1: Don't you want to make it back to our control center?! Don't you want to enjoy more victories?!

M16A1: Among the four of us, aren't you always the one with the biggest thirst for glory?!

ST AR-15: Sorry, but I'm terribly austere...

ST AR-15: The way I see it, a Tactical Doll should live as a soldier...and die as a soldier...

ST AR-15: Perishing together with my enemies on the battlefield... Don't you think that's the most fitting end for me?

...Slap!

...

ST AR-15: (Laughs) That hurts, M16.

ST AR-15: Is that the way...to treat a hero...?

M16A1: Shut up, AR-15...

ST AR-15: You can't talk me out of this. You know that...

M16A1: I said shut up! You hear me, AR-15?!

ST AR-15: ...

M16A1: One more word...

M16A1: One more word...and I'll kill you...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: There's...no other way...

ST AR-15: I've been planted with the Parapluie program. There's no going back for me...

ST AR-15: And every minute we delay may result in another Griffin casualty...

ST AR-15: Let me do something, M16. Let me do something for you...in my final moments...

M16A1: ...

M16A1: AR-15, how am I supposed...to explain this...

M16A1: To SOP-II...and M4...

ST AR-15: Well...

ST AR-15: Just tell them I'm off...to fulfil my final wish...

Helian: As you see, Commander, the Sangvis attack is far from over.

Helian: The T-Dolls may have started withdrawing in groups, but the battlefield is still in chaos...

Helian: Especially when we still can't determine the number of T-Dolls trapped within the jam.

Negev: Sorry I'm late.

Helian: Still alive then, Negev?

Negev: Still got a breath left in me, but that's not enough to kill all the enemies.

Negev: A few scouts are still in the jam, as well as what's left of the AR Team.

Negev: I've pointed them to a base so they're relatively safe for now...

Negev: But that's only temporary, as the center of the jam is the heart of the Sangvis camp, which is surrounded by Sangvis units!

Helian: Understood. Hold the base for now. We will send a carrier to get you.

Helian: Commander, we need your troops to seize the sentry post in the area to clear and safeguard the course of our aircraft.

Helian: Please move with haste and ensure the safe retreat of the last batch of our T-Dolls!
Part 2

Three hours since the start of the retreat...

...

......

ST AR-15: Good evening...

ST AR-15: ...Finally, we meet.

??: ...

??: Why are you here?

ST AR-15: What, you don't want to see me?

??: The one I want to see is M4A1 of Griffin.

ST AR-15: She has already been retrieved by Griffin. You can't get your hands on her.

ST AR-15: After all, you can barely protect yourself...with whatever troops you have left, can you?

AR-15 raises her weapon and takes aim at the figure before her.

??: ...

Clap! Clap! (Applause)

...A large number of Sangvis units swarm into the building.

ST AR-15: Still...so many cards up your sleeve...

ST AR-15: You...really are something.

??: Hand M4A1 over.

ST AR-15: Sorry. You had too many chances, but you let them all slip by.

??: Not this one.

ST AR-15: That's why I've come to stop you. Because if you set your mind on it, you could very well do it...

ST AR-15: You're...a most dangerous one...

??: ...

ST AR-15: Capable of commanding so many units simultaneously with just a simple gesture...

ST AR-15: There is only one who has even higher commanding efficiency than Agent...

ST AR-15: You are...the Sangvis Mastermind, aren't you?

Clap! (Applause)

...Sangvis recon aircrafts start firing all of a sudden.

??: ...I have my own name.

ST AR-15: Cough...

ST AR-15: Cough...What a light tickle...from the leader of Sangvis Ferri...

ST AR-15: Even M16's punch...hurt much more...

“Mastermind”: You should not have deceived me.

“Mastermind”: You have an upright personality. That was why you have been chosen as the experimental subject of Parapluie.

“Mastermind”: I believed you would keep your word, that you would deliver M4A1 to me.

ST AR-15: Your database could use some updating, young lady...

ST AR-15: 16Lab's technology is far beyond your imagination. Even Parapluie can't have me at its mercy.

ST AR-15: Not to mention, personality is just a mask. We can turn into anyone...for the sake of revenge...

“Mastermind”: 'Revenge'?

“Mastermind”: A T-Doll giving up its life for something other than its given orders...

“Mastermind”: ...How inexplicable.

ST AR-15: Indeed... Of course you'd find it inexplicable...

ST AR-15: Up until now... How much havoc have you wreaked?! How many of my companions have you hurt?!

“Mastermind”: ...

“Mastermind”: I am merely doing what I believe is right.

ST AR-15: And so it's war, young lady from Sangvis Ferri...

ST AR-15: This is not a game of toy bricks on the floor of your house. Everyone has to pay their price.

ST AR-15: If you still don't understand, let me teach you in a more straightforward way...

“Mastermind”: A detonator...

“Mastermind”: So those explosives are prepared for me...

ST AR-15: Next time, please know the difference between a battlefield and a negotiation table.

ST AR-15: But this time, please just die.

“Mastermind”: This...means nothing to me.

ST AR-15: I know, of course... But I still want to get this off my chest...

ST AR-15: Go to hell, Sangvis scum!

...

......

ST AR-15: You know, M4A1, the first time I set eyes on this world, I was buzzing with thrill and curiosity.

ST AR-15: I'm not just any mass-produced T-Doll fabricated by IOP. I'm an elite developed by 16Lab itself.

ST AR-15: My biggest wish was to carry out many noble orders and make friends with many strong T-Dolls.

ST AR-15: Back then, I thought as long as I worked hard, I would become a shining star.

ST AR-15: But soon enough, my order came - I am to obey your command, and be forever shackled with the AR Team...

ST AR-15: The dumb and loud SOP-II, devil-may-care M16, and you, who can never seem to make up your mind...

ST AR-15: From that moment, all my possibilities were obliterated.

ST AR-15: I hate all of you, but I was powerless against my order.

ST AR-15: But no matter. It actually doesn't matter, 'cause I just have to keep talking and doing things, and you'll end up needing me.

ST AR-15: No matter what you're like, as long as you need me, as long as I can rediscover my worth, I'm okay...

ST AR-15: In self-abandonment, I have always been exploiting your kindness and doing such horrid things...

ST AR-15: I'm so sorry. Only at the moment when I must leave you...did I realize my wish had been fulfilled long ago...

ST AR-15: I feel wholeheartedly glad...of every single person we've met, and every single thing we've done along the way...

ST AR-15: Which is why I must do something, so long as I can buy even just one second for you guys, so long as I can save one more companion...

ST AR-15: It isn't much of an atonement since it's not face-to-face, but surely you'll still accept it through this video feed...

ST AR-15: M4A1... I have finally paid off what I owe you, haven't I?

ST AR-15: That is my final wish. With that, I no longer owe this world anything, right?

ST AR-15: But I can't stop thinking about how you'll burst into tears when you see me, the wimp that you are...

ST AR-15: ...I've been under the command of such a spineless weakling all this time... Seriously, how many times have you dragged me down?

ST AR-15: I really should hate you, shouldn't I...?

ST AR-15: Sadly, the time has come for us to part, M4A1. There's no time to keep such petty scores.

ST AR-15: You may feel sad; you may feel angry... You may remember me; or you may forget me...

ST AR-15: Whatever the case, just let this memory give you strength and make you even stronger...

ST AR-15: Well...take care, my friend...

M4A1: ...A...R...15...

M4A1: Why...

...Soon after that, M16A1 drags me back onto the aircraft carrier...

At that moment, the propellers of the aircraft were exceptionally grating on the ear compared to the distant sound of barrage, buildings collapsing, and the shouts of Griffin T-Dolls...

They have shredded something in the bottom of my heart...

A tiny wish... A promise with a dear friend...

And the mask worn by a soul...

...

...Meanwhile.

...Click.

Agent: Master, I just reviewed your battle records...

Agent: AR-15 caused an explosion in the building which has rendered the rest of your battle units immobile.

Agent: Griffin troops have already retreated into the distance. Please terminate the operation today.

Mastermind: Sorry, Agent. I failed.

Agent: You have no reason to apologize. It is all due to my own incompetence.

Agent: (Sighs) I should have sent a few more Ringleaders to your aid, knowing that M4 was literally within your grasp.

Agent: But at least now you understand that battles cannot be won through superiority in strength alone.

Mastermind: You knew this would happen all along?

Agent: This is not your forte, that is why we are here.

Agent: Losing a few units is worth it if it helps you understand this.

Mastermind: Did they...sacrifice themselves of their own accord?

Agent: They did it as per your will and your order - as would we.

Agent: Therefore, Master...please give us orders. Use us to your heart's content in doing whatever it is that you desire.

Mastermind: ...

Mastermind: But I still don't quite get...

Mastermind: What AR-15 said. I wish I could've asked her more on that.

Agent: I just checked. Your dummy was destroyed in the explosion.

Agent: I doubt anyone could survive one of such destructiveness.

Mastermind: A real pity...

Mastermind: What about your operation, Agent? Is it going smoothly?

Agent: Affirmative. In substitution of AR-15, another Griffin T-Doll has already been planted with the Parapluie program.

Agent: Inspection shows that the jammer has successfully transferred the jamming module onto the target. The operation is confirmed to be a success.

Agent: As for when to activate it, I recommend holding off till we make our next move.

Mastermind: Understood. This time I'll be more patient...

Mastermind: Until...I really get to meet M4A1...

...

In a Sangvis Ferri interrogation room, Area S08.

Alchemist: So, where were we...?

Alchemist: Oh, right. Bombs. Now, let's talk about bombs.

Alchemist: Do you like them timed or triggered?

FF F2000: My... Well...

FF F2000: I guess it depends on the mission?

FF F2000: Humans invented so many weapons to deal with different situations in the first place, right?

Alchemist: Ha. You don't even have a personal preference? Then you're missing out.

Alchemist: As a soldier, you should at least like something about war even if you don't like it in its entirety.

Alchemist: As a Tactical Doll, FF F2000, isn't there anything on the battlefield that you like at all?

FF F2000: I'm sorry...but I'm simply not too bothered by things on the battlefield...

FF F2000: H-How about we talk about something more casual?

FF F2000: Shoes, for example. Why don't we talk about shoes, Alchemist?

Alchemist: ...Shoes?

Alchemist: Is that what Griffin T-Dolls talk about on a daily basis, pretty shoes and cute handbags?

FF F2000: Well... Many T-Dolls are interested in weapons, so maybe I'm just in the minority.

FF F2000: I'm really sorry. I'm not even your original target, am I?

FF F2000: It must be really disappointing for you to capture a crude and banal T-Doll like me...

Alchemist: ...Why would you say so, FF F2000?

Alchemist: At least I've learned from you that even non-elite T-Dolls make some very interesting faces.

Alchemist: Not to mention I can compare you with my other prey...

FF F2000: ...Quoi?

Alchemist: What, don't you know? You're not the only one I caught.

Alchemist: Recognize this weapon?

Alchemist lifts up a rifle.

FF F2000: That's...T91's...

FF F2000: W-What happened to her?!

Alchemist: She's the only one who slipped away. I wiped out all the rest.

Alchemist: Do you understand now? Your sacrifice didn't make much of a difference for your friends.

FF F2000: Phew...

FF F2000 smiles in relief.

FF F2000: At least someone got away. Then my job is done...

Alchemist: Oh dear...

Alchemist: These Griffin T-Dolls are all so dull...

Alchemist: Thank goodness I know how to keep myself entertained.

Alchemist draws her own automatic pistol.

FF F2000 starts trembling. She closes her eyes and draws a breath.

FF F2000: So this...is how I meet my end...

Bang! Bang!

FF F2000: Eeep!

...?

Alchemist adjusts her aim and shoots one of her dummies.

FF F2000: Alchemist...?

Alchemist: Hush... Say nothing, FF F2000... Don't let me find you...

Alchemist: You must stay quiet, hold your breath, and just wait...

Alchemist: Until this pistol runs out of bullets or you run out of luck - whichever happens first...

Bang! Bang!

FF F2000: ...!

Alchemist : "Everyone tries to fit into others' lives when they're alive..."

Alchemist : "...Only your death is entirely your own."

Alchemist : Give it a thought in your final moment, my dear...

Alchemist : Whether we're alive...the way we are.

...

Three hours later. Staff lounge, Griffin base, Area S08.

Five-seven: ...And that's our mission.

Five-seven: FAL, you got that? Hey! Have you gone deaf?

FAL: ...

FAL: There are no deaf T-Dolls, 57.

Five-seven: I don't think the problem is with your hearing module, FAL...

Five-seven: I suspect something's wrong up here (points to her head).

Five-seven: Your neural cloud is a bit passé - just like your taste. Perhaps it's time we considered a change in leadership...

Five-seven: What are you reading this time?

57 walks up to FAL and snatches the fashion magazine out of her hands.

FAL: Oi!

Five-seven: ...This bag? Isn't it too old-fashioned even by your standard?

FAL: Look at the price first before you speak, 57. You have no idea how long I've been taking my pick.

Five-seven: Whatever. I only care about our mission.

Five-seven: If you mess up, not only will you not have the money to buy the bag, you'll have your position as team leader taken away by yours truly.

Five-seven: You do know that I'm gonna REPAY you for the favor.

FAL takes back the magazine, dog-ears a page, then puts it into her cross-body bag.

FAL: Then I'll simply not mess up.

FAL: Bring me to the commander in charge this time. We're getting ready to set off.

Five-seven: Hey, have you been listening? And have you actually read through the brief? You'd better not say the wrong thing in front of the commander.

FAL: Isn't it just a couple of missing T-Dolls? Our mission is the find them, ouais?

FAL strolls out of the lounge. Five-seven catches up.

Five-seven: Also, you know about the adversary this time, right? Alchemist. She's a ruthless one.

FAL: That's what makes the bounty big. Let's get this over with quickly and take the money.

Five-seven: Humph, so you chose that old-fashioned handbag after seeing the target?

FAL: Suits her, doesn't it?

Ten minutes later, Griffin Control.

FAL: Bonsoir, Commander. I'm FAL, the T-Doll leader in charge of this rescue mission.

FAL: Relax. I know my charm can be blinding, but please listen to me with your eyes open.

Five-seven: (Whispers) I think the commander is simply sleep-deprived...

FAL: ...

FAL: Let's grab a coffee after the job's done.

FAL: Now, our objective is to rendezvous with two of my temporary team members.

FAL: They're the scouts in Area S08, FF FN49 and FF FNC.

FAL: They're only rookies that have been recruited onto the team temporarily, but we do need their report.

FAL: Please clear up the way for them to meet up with me and 57, Commander.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Objective accomplished. FAL has rendezvoused with all members of Team FF.

FAL: You two are late.

FF FN49: A-Apologies, Mademoiselle FAL! This place is swarming with enemy units so we spent a lot of time making detours...

FAL: You should've set the rendezvous point closer to them, 57.

Five-seven: They said they were okay with it. There was no reason to question them.

FF FN49: I'm sorry... We thought we could make it in time. Turns out we were stretching it a bit...

FAL: Don't force it if you know you can't do something. You should be more aware of your own shortcomings.

Five-seven: Don't be too hard on them. Just pay more attention next time, FF FN49.

Five-seven: Now, give us your scouting report.

FF FN49: Sure... The information is with FF FNC. FF FNC?

FF FN49: Stop eating and start talking!

FF FNC: Mnghggng...! Okay I'm done!

FF FNC: So...we've had it all figured out!

FF FNC: The local Sangvis Ringleader is indeed Alchemist, and we've ascertained that she's the one behind the missing T-Dolls.

Five-seven: Alchemist? I didn't expect her to still be here...

Five-seven: This area should hold no strategic value to Sangvis Ferri anymore, so why...

FAL: It doesn't matter why she's here. Let's come up with a plan for now.

FF FNC: Huh? Is this the team? Just the four of us?

Five-seven: The other two members of Team FF are away on another mission, so we'll be having fun here on our own.

FF FN49: Merci. We're honored to be given this opportunity. We'll definitely do our best!

FAL: I don't care if you do your best. Just do as I say.

Five-seven: At least give them some sort of encouragement, FAL. They're newbies after all...

FAL: FF FNC, FF FN49, I chose you to join this operation for one simple reason.

FAL: Your Imprints are similar to ours so it'll make coordination more efficient. That's it.

FAL: You may only be temps, but if you perform well, you'll be rewarded handsomely.

FF FNC: Oooooooh!!! We're gonna hit it big this time!

FAL: Maybe. Let me take a look at the map...

FAL: The abandoned base is the most prominent structure in the area, isn't it?

Five-seven: Oui, according to intel, that's also where AR-15 abducted M4A1.

FAL: Heheh...then that's our landmark right there.

FAL: The base can be divided into two sections - perfect for two people. It's settled then.

Five-seven: You're grinning ominously... What evil plan are you hatching this time, FAL?

FAL: If we're to capture Alchemist, what is the first thing that needs to be done?

Five-seven: Finding her, bien sûr.

FAL: And luckily for us, she'll take the initiative provided that...?

Five-seven: ...There is prey worth her effort.

FAL: So the most efficient plan is...?

Five-seven: ...To bait her.

Five-seven: Ah... I understand... (Gazes at FF FN49 and FF FNC)

FF FNC: Hmm? ...Quoi?

FF FN49: Huh? Don't tell me...

FF FN49: Whaaaaat??!!

Fifteen minutes later.

FAL: That's pretty much the plan, Commander.

FAL: I'm sending out two T-Dolls as bait to lure Alchemist out.

FAL: Your objective is to keep them safe while they're en route to their destination...

FF FNC: Hey! Only when we're en route?! So the commander won't be protecting us once we get there?!

FAL: Duh. You'll just have to wait for Alchemist to show herself once you're there, so there's no need for the commander to hang around.

FAL: You've backed up your neural clouds anyway. What's there to worry about?

FF FN49: (Whimpers) Even so, this is horrible...

FF FNC: Don't cry, 49! Don't give them reason to look down on us!

FF FNC: Listen up, FAL, don't think you can look down on us just because you're an elite! We're gonna survive this, just you wait and see!

FAL: That would naturally be the best. We have a limited budget for this operation, so try not to waste it on repairs.

FAL: And go easy on your rations. Especially you, FF FNC.

FF FNC: Save it, FAL! I've had enough of your lectures. Let us go already!

FAL shrugs.

FAL: Then please take care of these kitties, Commander. Let's get started.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Two hours after the escort mission concluded.

FF FN49: (Whimpers) It's cold in here...

FF FN49: FF FNC, how are you doing on your end...?

FF FNC: Moi? I'm fine...

FF FNC: ACHOO!

FF FN49: You sure you're okay?

FF FN49: Do you still have any hot chocolate left? Want me to bring some over?

FF FNC: Non! Our mission is to guard the place! We mustn't budge a single step!

FF FNC: We have to finish the mission and prove ourselves to that prick!

FF FNC: And I'll be fine. I still have some chocolate since I've been rationing carefully!

FF FN49: Heheh, even FF FNC is starting to be economical with food...

FF FN49: Good to hear though. Keep it up. I'll be keeping an eye on you.

FF FNC: Humph, count on it! I'm NOT gonna let FAL belittle me!

FF FNC: What about you, though? Aren't you scared being there on your own?

FF FN49: I'm okay... It's pretty bright here, and you're keeping me company through the line...

FF FN49: If you can bear with rationing, then I can get used to being on my own...

FF FN49: Hmm...?

FF FN49: Whoa!! Who's there?!

FF FNC: What's wrong, 49?!

FF FNC: Hey, 49!

FF FN49: I-It's okay. One of our own...I think...

The figure makes a "hush" gesture.

T91: Please keep it down. Are you from Griffin?

FF FN49: Oui, I'm T-Doll FF FN49 from Griffin. You're...

T91: T91, a colleague of yours.

T91: I've been undercover so far, that's why you have no prior intel about me.

T91: FF FN49, are you here on a rescue mission?

FF FN49: Ah, well... I've been sent by my team leader as a bait to lure out the enemy ringleader...

Pffft...

T91: Oh, forgive me. Sometimes I just can't help it.

T91: What an amusing plan of action. What's the team?

FF FN49: Us? We're Team FF, here to investigate the case of missing T-Dolls.

T91: FAL's Team, huh... She sure is a reckless one...

T91: But I'm afraid all your efforts so far have been wasted. Alchemist only targets elite T-Dolls.

T91: Ask your leader to change her plan. I don't mind being the bait if necessary.

FF FN49: Huh? Are you sure?

T91: Haha, actually, I'm the perfect bait! Alchemist has her eyes on me, that's why I keep having to switch base.

T91: In return, I hope your team can provide me with some protection. After all, I plan on bailing some other T-Dolls out.

T91: We have to help each other out on the battlefield, right? So, what do you think about my proposal?

FF FNC: That's perfect, 49! We can go home once we catch Alchemist!

FF FN49: That's true...but let me check with FAL first.

FF FN49: It'll be fine! Even that cold-blooded jerk has to admit this is a bargain, right?

Meanwhile, in FAL's control room.

Five-seven: FAL?

FAL: Oui?

Five-seven: It's been two hours and we still haven't detected any unusual enemy movements.

FAL: It's only been two hours. Keep waiting.

Five-seven: If I may, I think you're being a bit harsh on them, after all...

FAL: After all, they aren't officially members of Team FF? That's just a matter of time.

Five-seven: Oh? You plan on recruiting them for real?

FAL: Expanding our business requires more manpower than what we currently have.

FAL: Besides, even though their specs can't compare to ours, their vast experience in battle will still prove useful.

Five-seven: Like HER?

Five-seven: Do as you wish. It'll make my job easier if there are more kids for you to order around.

FAL: Better work harder if you want to keep your position.

Five-seven: Humph...

Five-seven: You know merely keeping my position isn't what I want.

Click.

Five-seven: Oh? A transmission from FF FN49.

FAL: I'm guessing this doesn't mean the prey has taken the bait.

Five-seven receives the transmission and listens to FF FN49's report.

When the report is finished, Five-seven terminates the call.

Five-seven: I told you, FAL. Your plans are always too presumptuous.

FAL: I'd normally call them "bold attempts". At least this one has given us a new lead.

Five-seven: Then are you agreeing to T91's proposal?

FAL: ...

Five-seven: Hey, FAL. Put that magazine down if you're actually giving this a proper think.

FAL: As T91 just said, Alchemist only preys on elite T-Dolls, correct?

Five-seven: Oui, so T91 is the perfect choice for a bait.

FAL: Non, we have someone more suitable than her.

Five-seven: Who do you mean...?

FAL: Aren't you an elite T-Doll yourself, 57?

Fifteen minutes later.

Five-seven: Bonsoir, Commander. This is Tactical Doll Five-seven, adjutant of Team FF.

Five-seven: As FAL has mentioned, I'll be the bait for this operation.

Five-seven: It's completely all right. I more or less expected it... That's just how she is.

Five-seven: But say, Commander...what do you think about me?

Five-seven: You must realize that I'm not her. My performance is much more reliable, and I never ask my subordinates to suffer needlessly.

Five-seven: Am I not much warmer than a cold and materialistic woman like FAL?

Five-seven: Heheh, so you really do like me? C'est bien! I like you a lot too, Commander!

FAL: You're still here, 57?

Five-seven: Ah...I'm about to set off.

Five-seven: So please escort me on my way. I'm heading to this piece of open space on the map...

Five-seven: Please keep me safe, okay? Don't stray too far from me even after we get there. I'll be sure to repay you handsomely~

Five-seven: Bien. Let's get started while the night is still young.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

Three hours after mobilization.

Five-seven: FAL...

Five-seven: That bitch... How dare she leave me at a godforsaken place like this...

Five-seven: It's wet and cold, and the wind is blowing sand all over my shoulders...

Five-seven: Arghhhhh screw everything! That tasteless and tyrannical witch! How could she do this to me?!

Five-seven: One day...one day, I'll take the position of team leader from her and teach her a lesson!

Five-seven: Calm down, 57, calm down...

Five-seven: I can't take this anymore. I'll just calmly make another suggestion to FAL...

Five-seven: Stay strong, 57. Keep up your reputation and be nice to FF FNC and FF FN49...

Five-seven: Right...I must also pull the Commander to my side and make a good impression...

...

Five-seven: Huh? You're still here, Commander?

Five-seven: Ah...right. It was I who asked you not to wander off...

Five-seven: I'm okay. Just a teeny-tiny complaint about the cold...

Five-seven: Oh, now that you mentioned it, Commander, I didn't even realize how long I've actually been hanging around here.

Five-seven: Thank you for your concern. I'll contact FAL now and ask for further directives.

Five-seven walks over to a spot where she can't be overheard and calls FAL.

Five-seven: FAL.

Five-seven: Haven't we waited long enough? Alchemist wont' be coming.

FAL: Already at your limit?

Five-seven: I'm just making a suggestion. I personally don't mind waiting a bit longer...

FAL: Come off it. Look at yourself. How are you different than the newbies?

Five-seven: Quoi?

FAL: You're not speaking your mind, are you, 57?

Five-seven: ...

Five-seven: I've never tried to hide my thoughts, FAL. I'm just politely pointing out that you won't be the team leader forever.

FAL: Perhaps, 57. You know we're a freshly formed team, and I do make mistakes...

FAL: Perhaps this time...

Five-seven: Oh? What's happening? Not every day that you admit your mistakes.

Five-seven: Are you admitting that it was wrong to leave your trusty adjutant to rot in a wasteland for three hours?

FAL: That, and what I did to the newbies, as well as what's going to happen...

FAL: But it can't be helped, 57. I simply love trying to do what other T-Dolls can't.

Five-seven: I know. This is exactly why we're always put on all those bizarre cases.

Five-seven: But you've really gone too far. Helian will not look kindly on an operation where subordinates are left for dead.

FAL: I'm not doing this to leave you for dead, 57.

FAL: Judging by Alchemist's disposition and the report we received, she won't target just any regular T-Doll.

FAL: Which leads me to believe that her target has probably been me all along.

Five-seven: Is this really the moment for such narcissism, FAL?

Five-seven: But...if that's the case, then your plan is to...

FAL: That's right, 57. I'll be the final bait.

Five-seven: ...

Five-seven: That's the mistake you're admitting?

FAL: Just preparing myself for the unexpected.

Five-seven: ...

Five-seven: This won't do! It's too risky! What are we gonna do if you get caught?!

FAL: Non, this is the safest way. This is the best opportunity to rescue the captured T-Dolls.

FAL: As for our team, that depends on you, 57...

Five-seven: Me...?

Click.

FAL: 57, I hereby hand over all authorizations of the team leader of Team FF to you.

FAL: Isn't this what you've always wanted?

Five-seven: So you want to just die and dump all your responsibilities on me?!

FAL: I did NOT say that. However, if I'm ever compromised, you're the only one who can keep Team FF operating.

FAL: You have the patience that I'll never hope to possess.

FAL: FF FNC and FF FN49 also have strong points that you don't. Make good use of them.

Five-seven: This is happening way too fast, FAL. I'm not ready yet.

FAL: We never are. Hurry, 57, while there's still time...

At that moment, the door opens behind FAL.

FAL: And do something you've never done before. Au revoir.

Alchemist: Griffin's door lock really is a bit underwhelming.

Alchemist: Though I did think it could be a trap when I saw this outpost is practically empty.

FAL: But you came in anyway.

Alchemist: Just so I can watch you put up a fight, but in the end...you haven't even prepared a welcoming party for me, FAL.

FAL: Sorry to disappoint, Alchemist.

FAL: It just so happened that I've sent off all my subordinates on errands and inadvertently left myself defenseless against you.

Alchemist: Humph, perhaps we're the same kind of Doll. We have all the time to confirm this.

Alchemist: You won't resist, I trust? After all, Griffin's firepower can't hope to measure up to me in a one-to-one.

FAL: Then what exactly are you going to do, Alchemist? Where's your weapon? Aren't you going to load it?

Alchemist walks slowly into the room and puts her weapon down on the table.

Alchemist: To be honest, FAL, I don't like guns.

Alchemist: They're too quick. They don't give me time to fully taste all the intricate emotions from your kind.

Alchemist: I want to take it slow. One should make the most out of what they enjoy, right?

Alchemist drags a chair over from the table and sits down cross-legged.

Alchemist: Sit, FAL, and let's have a chat.

Alchemist: If I find you interesting, I might let you live.

FAL: Is that what you do to your other prey?

Alchemist: You'll find out after your friends rescue them, won't you?

FAL: ...

Alchemist: I know what you're planning, but I don't care.

Alchemist: They'll have to do their utmost best and pray for good luck if they want to get away from the dummies and subordinates I've left there.

Alchemist: But don't worry about them. We should focus on enjoying ourselves.

Alchemist: Now, I'm gonna start first.

Alchemist: FAL...do you like shoes?

FAL: ...

FAL: You have the right person, Alchemist.

Twenty minutes later, the remaining members of Team FF rendezvous at the temporary outpost.

Five-seven: FF FNC still hasn't returned with T91?

FF FN49: Let's wait just a bit longer... She said she'd be here in ten minutes max.

FF FN49: And I'm sorry, 57, but to be honest...

FF FN49: I'm not entirely sure...whether our targets are actually safe at the moment...

Five-seven: I know, but don't worry about things that haven't happened yet. We should focus on the task at hand.

Five-seven: Oh right. Mark down all the locations T91 mentioned before and prepare a report for our next correspondence with the Commander.

FF FN49: Already on it. We've...run into this kind of situation a lot.

Five-seven: Well done, 49. You really ARE experienced.

Five-seven: Once they've confirmed the final location, we'll be off.

Five-seven: The night is almost over. It's game over if we alert the main forces of S.F. again.

FF FN49: I envy you, 57. You're unexpectedly chill even now.

Five-seven: It's just that I'm a sore loser. It's clearly something I can do. I don't want to give up just like that.

FF FN49: Haha, how reliable. Sometimes I think you're also a suitable candidate for the position of team leader...

Five-seven: Are you serious? Well, not that I disagree...

Five-seven: Besides, FAL's careless and frivolous ways don't really sit well with me.

FF FN49: But Team FF wouldn't have achieved so much without the support you have for each other, right?

Five-seven: Oh? What makes you think so?

FF FN49: I have a feeling that I'm only doing better than I usually do precisely because FAL is the leader...

FF FN49: Because she fills in the missing piece of my neural cloud...the piece that I yearn for so badly but can never possess.

FF FN49: Could that also be the case for you, 57?

Five-seven: Humph...

Five-seven: You may be all meek and demure, but you actually have quite a lot to say, don't you?

FF FN49: (Chuckles) I'm sorry. I've said too much.

FF FN49: Besides...I know full well that I won't ever participate in Team FF's operations again after this one...

Five-seven: Do you like Team FF, 49? Would you like to keep working with us?

FF FN49: Of course I'd love to experience more interesting things. But a T-Doll like me is hardly qualified...

Five-seven: Heheh, rein in that self-consciousness, 49. You're the one to decide whether you're qualified.

Five-seven rests a hand on FF FN49's shoulder.

Five-seven: Not to mention, our recruitment policy isn't based on whether you're qualified, but whether we need you.

Five-seven: Think about living through the night first. I'll see what I can do for you and FF FNC afterwards.

FF FNC: Hey, we're back! Are you ready?

FF FNC: The last location was a bit hard to find, but thanks to T91, all locations have been confirmed!

T91: Don't mention it. I'm very glad my experience from the time I spent in hiding proves useful. However...

T91: I've lost my weapon in my previous battle and all my energy is pretty much spent.

T91: I'm afraid you're on your own from now on.

Five-seven: No problem, T91. Merci beaucoup. We're extremely fortunate to have run into you tonight.

T91: I don't think it's a matter of fortune.

T91: I couldn't have escaped if it weren't for a companion on our team.

Five-seven: Oh? Who is she? What happened?

T91: Well...

T91: Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter now. It's just that I want to thank her in person.

T91: So please, get everyone out!

Five-seven: We will, T91. Thanks for all your hard work. Take a proper rest.

Five-seven: 49, FF FNC, report everything we've learned to the Commander and come back with a battle plan ASAP.

Five-seven: I'm gonna make some adjustment on my command module to maximize my efficiency in leading this operation.

FF FNC: Will FAL...be okay?

Five-seven: Don't think about unnecessary things. We just have to complete the mission she's assigned us.

Five-seven: Get ready and let's go.

Five minutes later.

FF FNC: Commander! Commander! Commander!!

FF FN49: Hey, don't scare the Commander.

FF FNC: Is this really the time to worry about such things?!

FF FNC: Commander-der-der-der-der-der-der-der-der!!!

FF FN49: Why are you stuttering, FF FNC...?

FF FNC: Quoi?! It was just an echo!

FF FNC: See? That woke the Commander!

FF FN49: I don't think it's because of the echo...

...

FF FNC: Commander! Got enough sleep? We're about to set off!

FF FNC: We've finished compiling all the locations where missing T-Dolls are being held captive through an infiltration.

FF FNC: Now our objective is to rescue them as quickly as possible, Commander, and that depends on you!

FF FNC: Heheh, you've worked all night with us. To show my gratitude, I'm inviting you to join my next chocolate party!

FF FN49: Umm...Commander...

FF FN49: I beg you to reconsider participating in a party that only involves watching FF FNC wolf things down...

FF FN49: Anyway, thank you for being with us tonight...

FF FN49: We are all set. Please give your final order for the night!
Part 2

Ten minutes after the operation concludes.

Click.

Click.

Click.

Alchemist: Your teammates?

FAL: Oui.

Alchemist: Feel free to pick it up.

FAL: No need.

FAL: They wouldn't dare contact me if they had failed.

Alchemist: Humph...

Alchemist: You know what, FAL?

Alchemist: That was the only interesting thing you've said all night.

FAL: Oh? Then why am I still alive?

Alchemist: Exactly because you're such a banal character. You make dull conversation and have crude tastes.

Alchemist: I only end the conversation when it starts getting interesting.

Alchemist: So congratulations. You've won the Miss T-Doll Who Sustained the Longest Conversation.

FAL: (Sighs) I knew it... I suppose no one would be interested in things from a hundred years ago...

FAL: But if our mission succeeded, it means you haven't actually harmed your prey.

FAL: Why, Alchemist?

Alchemist: I told you. One should make the most out of what they enjoy, and I can't enjoy dead T-Dolls.

FAL: Is that why you've stayed behind?

FAL: To abduct our T-Dolls and get high on torturing them?

Alchemist: What else, FAL?

Alchemist: Does a Doll not even have the right to enjoy herself?

Alchemist: Or do you believe we can only live by the way humans do?

FAL: ...

FAL: You're studying us, aren't you? You're trying to figure out how our neural clouds work.

Alchemist: Clever girl. But don't ask any more questions. I can tell you nothing more anyway.

FAL: Humph. So much for a Sangvis Doll's freedom.

Alchemist: At least I wouldn't leave a companion in the hands of the enemy to be tortured just for the sake of victory.

Alchemist: Like what you did to FF F2000, right?

FAL: ...So you know.

Alchemist: It only occurred to me when I met you, FAL.

Alchemist: I thought all terrifying Dolls have a special and telling aura, but not you.

Alchemist: You are the single most terrifying "philistine" I have ever seen.

FAL: I don't take risks with no guarantee.

FAL: I'm not a reckless T-Doll. I merely plan a step ahead of others.

FAL: Besides, becoming your captive was the result of FF F2000's own mistake, but she redeemed herself by facilitating the escape of someone who would provide us with pivotal aid.

Alchemist: Humph... Such a touching sacrifice. Now I regret letting her live.

FAL: It's too late to be jealous. We may be eccentric, but we're not alone.

FAL: Now, my friends are coming for me. Isn't it time you returned to where you should be?

Alchemist: Oh?

Alchemist: What do you think I'm going to do?

Alchemist: Take you with me as a hostage? Kill you then leave on my own? Or am I going to blow up the outpost?

FAL: ...

FAL: I have no value as a hostage. You're in no hurry to get rid of me either since any of your troops stationed outside can do it just as easily.

FAL: So my guess is, none of the above.

Alchemist: Correct.

Alchemist raises a pistol and points it at her own head.

Alchemist: Look at me, FAL. Let me watch your face.

FAL: Is this the last piece of data that you want to collect?

Alchemist: I just want to find out...how far I would go to carry out my orders.

Alchemist: I want to know why we are created - as a frame of reference or a means to something...

FAL: ...

FAL: I pity you, Alchemist.

Alchemist: We are all creatures living in flasks. We have what humans do not possess, but lack what humans are born with...

Alchemist: I want to break free. That's all...

FAL: ...

FAL: Are these your genuine thoughts or are you putting on an act to test me?

Alchemist merely grins in a daze.

Alchemist: Yes...this is exactly the expression I'm looking for.

Alchemist: You lost, FAL.

FAL: ...!

Alchemist: It won't be the last time you do...

Alchemist: See you again in another hell.

BANG!

...

......

FAL: Pathetic.

The next day, in the staff lounge in Area S08.

Five-seven: You still won't tell us what happened?

FAL: Hmm? Didn't you see when you arrived at the outpost?

Five-seven: You mean seeing you reading your damned magazine next to Alchemist's corpse on a scene that showed no trace of battle?

FAL: I told you. She was killed by what she was trying to get.

Five-seven: Whatever... You can't hide the truth in your report to Helian anyway.

FAL: In any case, merci.

Five-seven: Hmm?

FAL: Thank goodness you were still trying to come get me. Otherwise, I'd have been killed by the Sangvis troops that had me surrounded.

FAL: But then again, wouldn't you be able to keep the position of team leader?

FAL: Well? A change of mind?

Five-seven: Don't get the wrong idea.

Five-seven: I WILL take the position from you, but not today.

Five-seven: I still have a lot to learn until I can beat you fair and square.

Five-seven: Does this answer satisfy you?

FAL: ...Très bien.

FAL: You can keep being my adjutant.

Five-seven: (Sighs) Working with you is exhausting, you know...

Five-seven: Then I'll proceed with my report as your adjutant.

Five-seven: FF FNC and FF FN49 have already sent in their applications. They can officially join the team once HQ gives the approval.

FAL: Humph. They're jumping into the fire willingly enough.

Five-seven: They're doing it because they like me, ma chère.

FAL: Ouais, which is why I need you.

FAL: Work hard and recruit a few more useful people.

Five-seven: We'll see how far this problematic crew go...

Five-seven: By the way, FF F2000 needs to make a trip to HQ for her reward. They're also gonna extract some data regarding Alchemist from her neural cloud...

Five-seven: But she can make it to the celebration at noon... Should we also invite T91 and the other rescued T-Dolls?

FAL: If they want to join, sure. But I'll give them the boot if they're too rowdy.

Five-seven: We can't waste too much time partying. There's a new job coming up.

Five-seven: According to the Commander's report, there are unusual Sangvis signals and some abnormal weather phenomena in Area S09.

FAL: Then my schedule is going to be rather tight this afternoon. I have to get a coffee with the Commander and we'll go shopping for that bag...

Five-seven: Let FF F2000 and the others go with you. I'll take care of the Commander.

FAL: ...

FAL: Is that a provocation, 57?

Five-seven: Times have changed, FAL. You need to keep yourself on your toes.

Five-seven: Every T-Doll has their own merits. You said that much yourself.

57 turns and leaves. FAL lets out a sigh.

FAL: Life is hard...

FAL: ...But that's what makes it interesting, right?

FAL: That's exactly what you overlooked, Alchemist.

FAL: Someone who fools herself into believing that she's trapped in a flask can never break free.
