...

AK-12: How unsightly.

AK-12: The Griffin forces have all withdrawn. She won't survive if we leave her here.

AK-12: ...What do you think?

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: Angelia didn't ask us to take her in.

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: You said yourself that our job this time is to observe. We can't get involved until new orders come.

AK-12: Even if she dies...? Are you really okay with that?

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: Orders are orders. T-Dolls can't disobey.

AK-12: I know you can, and so do you.

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: ...

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: Are you abetting me in breaking the rules?

AK-12: I remember you're quite famous for disobeying orders.

AK-12: Well, do indulge my curiosity.

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: You're right.

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: I suppose no one would bat an eye no matter what I do on a team with such a name.

Familiar voice of a T-Doll: Then here's a question, AK-12... Is Task Force DEFY hiring?

AK-12: Humph, sly old fox...

AK-12: We actually do have an opening.

...

AK-12: In that case, DEFY will welcome its second temporary member.

AK-12: Don't let her drag us down, because this team...

AK-12: Well, it's made up of brand new, elite Doll models.

...35 minutes ago.

Current time is 1600 hours.

AK-12: It's no different from an actual battlefield at this point...

AK-12: I honestly couldn't imagine that a PMC could cause such a huge disturbance, just going by the data we received.

AK-12: But this ought to be a good thing, right? At the very least, it'll be easier for us to take action.

AK-12: Ah, it's time.

AK-12: Now then...

AK-12: Guess it's time for us to make our entrance.

AK-12: Ange, this is about the situation just now.

AK-12: We've confirmed that a team of human soldiers attacked the safe house where our target M4A1 was located.

AK-12: The exact casualty status of Griffin is unknown, but we can be sure that M4A1 herself was left in place.

AK-12: This is very strange, do you know why they would do that?

Ange: There's nothing strange about that. They must have their own agenda.

Ange: What about the disconnection procedure I had you execute?

AK-12: I've verified its completion, though it's a bit...flawed.

AK-12: The Doll M4A1 seems to be the center of attention for both sides. Is it alright to not recover her?

Ange: Let AR-15 decide. She knows what to do.

AK-12: You do know your old subordinates well.

Ange: You sound jealous.

AK-12: Don't say I didn't warn you. Excessive self-confidence is an undesirable trait in commanders.

Ange: Oh, I know that better than anyone else.

...The transmission ends.

AK-12: Yet another troublesome day, and I can't help but worry...

AK-12: Laws, systems, orders...why do humans have to live like Dolls?

AK-12: Have you thought about that question before...

AK-12: ...AR-15?

ST AR-15: ...I'm prepping my gear. Leave me alone.

AK-12: Oh? And where are you going all by yourself?

ST AR-15: Do you have to ask about everything I do? Ange authorized me to act independently, didn't she?

AK-12: Are you sure you want to go at it alone? You've still got Parapluie in you now, right?

AK-12: While it hasn't completely spread throughout your neural cloud, all your external connection functions have been locked down to avoid further contagion.

ST AR-15: So?

AK-12: Which means, you can't control dummies and you can't sync information on battlefield conditions with us. I trust I don't need to explain the implications of that.

ST AR-15: Indeed, I can't access the Zener Network, but I can still use the radio to establish basic comms.

ST AR-15: That's good enough for me. I'm best suited to working alone.

AK-12: I'm simply worried that you'll regret working alone afterwards.

ST AR-15: ...I never regret anything.

AK-12: There's often a price to be paid for speaking in absolutes. Don't you want to hear about the new mission that Ange handed down?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I'll hear you out for now.

AK-12: Ange wants us to rescue M4A1.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Are...are you doing this on purpose?

AK-12: On purpose? Whatever could you mean?

ST AR-15: Tsk...

ST AR-15: I don't believe you. This contradicts the initial plan.

AK-12: Plans change. Just like your destiny.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Then let's head out.

AK-12: Not planning to go alone anymore?

ST AR-15: Do you enjoy mocking others so much?

AK-12: Haha, not under most circumstances, but your reactions are just too amusing.

ST AR-15: There's still some distance from here to M4A1. What do you intend to do?

AK-12: I'll hail a drone cab, and then we'll have a nice comfy ride to our stop. Sounds good?

AK-12: Give me a break, of course we're going on foot.

ST AR-15: Just the two of us, fighting our way there?

AK-12: There are a lot of surviving Griffin T-Dolls along the way. All we have to do is recover them and temporarily overwrite their directives. That ought to be enough.

AK-12: Well? Surely you'd want to help out your old war buddies, right?

ST AR-15: I don't care.

ST AR-15: But there's no denying that it's the best shot we've got, so let's head out.

...

??: M4...

??: ...

??: M4A1...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: I... Where am I...

M4A1: ...!

M4A1: This...

M4A1: A...AR...

ST AR-15: Don't squirm.

ST AR-15: You're really heavy.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Is that...really you?

ST AR-15: Don't move your head. Hearing my voice should be enough, right?

M4A1: Why...

M4A1: ...I don't believe it!

M4A1: AR-15... You...you're alive?!

ST AR-15: Let's get out of here first. I'll explain it to you afterward.

M4A1: But why... Why did you show up here and now...

ST AR-15: I have a mission of my own. Running into you was simply a coincidence.

ST AR-15: But...I guess it's not a bad thing.

M4A1: Put me down, I'll walk on my own.

ST AR-15: I wouldn't need to carry you if you could walk.

M4A1: ...?!

M4A1: My body...is not responding...?

ST AR-15: If you want to blame someone for it, she's standing beside me...

ST AR-15: Something went wrong when she disconnected you. It caused slight damage to your neural module, so your ability to move has been temporarily restricted.

AK-12: Da, da, it's kind of my fault, which is why I'm carrying this case for you.

AK-12: Still, it's also your own people's fault for installing such sophisticated modules in an outdated T-Doll, right?

M4A1: That's... Whose voice is that?

AK-12: Tactical Doll AK-12, from Task Force DEFY.

M4A1: DEFY...? What do you do?

M4A1: AR-15, are you one of them now?

ST AR-15: I've got a new employer. Don't really have much choice in the matter.

ST AR-15: Her name's Angelia. You've met her before.

M4A1: Ange...lia...?

M4A1: ...You mean the woman who helped me enter the combat zone?

M4A1: How about the others?

M4A1: What about SOP-II...and RO?

ST AR-15: ...Now's not the time to think about them. Sangvis elites are still around.

ST AR-15: Focus on what's in front of you, keep quiet, and fall back with me.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: SOP-II...

M4A1: RO...

M4A1: I...remember...

M4A1: I saw RO and...

M4A1: No! I can't...I can't leave them behind!

M4A1: Put me down! Let me go back!

ST AR-15: Keep still! In your current condition, S.F. will capture you before you can take more than a few steps if I let you go!

M4A1: And whose fault is it that I'm like this?!

ST AR-15: We had no choice but to sever your Level II connection in order to break the link between you and the people monitoring you.

M4A1: The people monitoring me?

M4A1: ...Who? Who's monitoring me?

ST AR-15: Did you really think Sangvis Ferri was our only enemy?

M4A1: What...What exactly is going on...

M4A1: Isn't Griffin's mission...to wipe out Sangvis Ferri...?

M4A1: I...I abandoned my teammates and my objective...

ST AR-15: Whatever you want to do, get some rest first.

ST AR-15: We'll give you the power you want after that...

M4A1: ...

ST AR-15: M4?

AK-12: There was too much strain on her neural cloud. She couldn't sustain her Level I surface consciousness.

ST AR-15: What a mess...

ST AR-15: Go on, AK-12. Tell me what you found on the scene...

AK-12: Nothing but bad news.

AK-12: First off, M4 SOPMOD II's missing. I'm certain she's not in the vicinity, and there were no clues around which could tell us about her current status.

ST AR-15: ...

AK-12: Was I too direct?

ST AR-15: Better to be more direct...

ST AR-15: How about RO? I saw her...

...AK-12 sighs.

AK-12: RO635 has completely ceased to function, so...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I...I won't forgive them for this.

ST AR-15: Also, about what I said regarding the recovery of the fallen Dolls' neural module...

AK-12: RO635's was completely removed.

AK-12: I'm certain it happened after she was killed.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Could this be good news...

AK-12: Look on the bright side. Maybe SOP-II avoided the ambush and left with RO's neural module.

AK-12: Would you be satisfied with that answer?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I would very much like to assume that is the case.

AK-12: Naturally, I'd advise you against having that idea, lest you end up disappointed.

AK-12: But this is no time to think about others.

AK-12: There are two S.F. squads around us, at 11 o'clock and five o'clock respectively. The terrain nearby is such a mess so we can't go around them. We'll probably have to take them out.

ST AR-15: Can you really scout the battlefield while making small talk?

AK-12: Are you looking down on me, or overestimating yourself?

ST AR-15: Neither. We'll let the results of the battle speak for themselves.

ST AR-15: (M4...if you knew the state the AR Team was in...)

ST AR-15: (What...would you do?)

...

AK-12: Ange, we've recovered M4A1. Any instructions for our next move?

Ange: Looks like AR-15 has really been dragging you around on a leash.

AK-12: Well, you were the one who ordered me to abide by AR-15's judgment.

AK-12: Also, I was simply curious about our new member's decision-making and responses.

AK-12: Since everyone now wants a piece of M4A1, I'm sure getting our hands on her is the right thing to do.

Ange: That's not all M4A1 is worth. In any case, you both did very well.

Ange: How's the situation on your end?

AK-12: S.F.'s main forces are making a frenzied breakthrough towards Area S09 at high speed. I think things are really going to get seriously out of hand this time.

Ange: Got it. I've just given you new instructions. Carry them out ASAP and stay safe.

AK-12: Eh? These two requirements are contradictory—

...Click.

Ange terminates the transmission.

Ange: Here's our chance. We'll use this opportunity to penetrate S.F.'s main fortress. We'd best move as quickly as possible.

Ange: Are you back yet, AN-94?

AN-94: Awaiting your orders, Commander.

Ange: Thanks for the hard work. Give me a quick summary of Parapluie's transmission speed and its coverage.

AN-94: Parapluie's current transmission speed has reached its theoretical upper limit.

AN-94: That is because the Military's main forces have already pulled out, and the anti-jamming equipment they installed has shut down with their departure.

Ange: Looks like they really want to exterminate every last trace of Griffin...

AN-94: Also, some unexpected good news.

AN-94: They actually used a server from the Western Theatre HQ to build a Level II layer in order to provide computational support against S.F.

AN-94: It is still currently directly connected to the forward command terminal on this battlefield and unprotected by any firewalls.

AN-94: Do you want to make use of this opportunity? I suggest that we can first...

Ange: Oh? Looks like those old geezers got careless. Search through all the data in the server immediately using the keyword "OGAS"!

Ange: Oh yes, also include the names of all the officers who might be taking part in this operation!

AN-94: As hard-charging as ever?

Ange: Why else would they have issued me cutting-edge T-Dolls like yourself, if not because of that? Hurry up already.

AN-94: A moment please. There is too much redundant data. I need to clear them out.

...Five minutes later.

AN-94: Search complete, Ange. I have two pieces of information which will interest you.

AN-94: One of them is a Soviet Union operational report dating back from 2032, concerning the OGAS facility.

AN-94: The other is an excavation record connected to OGAS, detailing the unearthing of the small Relic site OKB-413 near Minsk.

Ange: A small...Relic site?

...Ange stares intently at the monitor.

Ange: So the information WAS correct after all. What...what they're after is incredible...

Ange: Don't tell me...OGAS was originally designed to...

AN-94: Now's not the time to take your time browsing. Parapluie is spreading rapidly, and this is very bad for us.

Ange: Indeed...we can't let S.F. keep expanding...

Ange: (Mutters to herself) Is this... could this be a namelist of the personnel from that operation in 32?

Ange: Carter and...Witkin?

AN-94: Please look up and answer me.

Ange: Aren't you capable of electronic warfare? Help me sort this out. Use the abandoned Dolls near point A as temporary shields for us.

AN-94: I can use the computational power of the abandoned Dolls on the battlefield to counteract the spread of Parapluie.

AN-94: However, a connection of that scale requires a great deal of computational space. I will need to enter Level II.

Ange: Got it. I'll leave it all to you.

AN-94: Are you paying attention? While my consciousness is in Level II, you will be unprotected.

...Ange looks up.

Ange: What, do you think I need protecting?
Part 2: Mid-stage dialogue

2

...

AN-94: Ange, I'm going to start hacking after this, but I still need your help.

AN-94: Signal jamming on the battlefield is very severe. I'll only be able to transmit successfully if you can maintain control on the surrounding radar comm stations.

Ange: So you'll be able to control the military units as long as we maintain control over the radar station, am I right?

AN-94: Yes, but I might get disconnected from time to time as the current situation is...

Ange: Very bad...I know.

Ange: So we might lose control over the military units every now and then, right? I'll prepare a solution for that ahead of time.

Ange: In any case, I'll take care of the radar stations. Just focus on taking down those big bruisers from the Military.
Part 3

    3chevron_right

After the battle ends...

AN-94: The computational power of those Dolls has been fully exhausted. If this keeps up, Parapluie might begin to break through my passive barriers.

Ange: Close the connection. I've seen enough. Thank you for your hard work.

AN-94: Understood.

Ange: There's a comms station near point A.

AN-94: Yes, we've been there before.

Ange: That's right. I need to use that comms station and the satellite communications equipment that we set up previously to contact someone on the outside.

Ange: Can you do that?

AN-94: I will.

...Click.

AN-94 disconnects.

Ange: The OGAS system...

Ange: It was originally designed by the Soviets as a ternary logic-based automated management system for the entire nation...

Ange: Now it's been simplified into the base protocol for controlling Sangvis AIs...

Ange: But is that really the case?

...

...Click.

Ange uses the comms station's equipment to send a transmission to the outside world.

Ange: ...Is that so?

Ange: Griffin's shifting towards Area S11?

Ange: I see it, it's a total mess over here.

Ange: ...There, I was right. The Military's going to use this as an excuse to openly enter the battlefield and restore order.

Ange: I know, that's just their excuse. Even now they're reorganizing their troops on the outskirts.

Ange: Once their main forces mobilize and intervene, we'll have no chance of stopping them at all.

Ange: Yes. I'll do my best to slow them down, but I can't hold on for long without support.

Ange: Eh...having our support troops standing by at the perimeter won't solve anything...I guess you know what they want to do...

Ange: I understand. I completely understand your concerns, Chief. I'll do my best to buy you time.

Ange: However, if the worst comes to the worst, I hope you will approve the plan I laid out earlier.

Ange: I understand, it's a very radical solution, but if...

Ange: Yes, yes, I'll wait for approval. I'll do my best to ensure it does not come to that.

...Transmission terminated.

Ange: Looks like it's time to go all-out now...

Ange: Hmm...I hope they're still alive.

...Click.

A transmission connects over an encrypted channel.

UMP45: Guten Tag. Have you missed me?

...

Ange: Nothing good ever happens when I think of you.

Ange: What about the "file"?

UMP45: Heheh, do you need to ask?

Ange: If it's been settled, then hurry back.

UMP45: We ran into a bit of trouble.

UMP45: Did you know? We caught up with Griffin's exodus by coincidence, so we helped them out a little.

Ange: Sier's told me all about how you love engineering these coincidences.

Ange: Alright, make a note of the people you saved and I'll help you get paid for it, assuming Griffin's still around after all this.

UMP45: If Griffin doesn't pay up, then please cough the money up from your own account.

Ange: Providing that I, the owner of the account, survive this mission.

UMP45: So, can you tell me the reason you're thinking of me?

UMP45: A new lead.

UMP45: Find a way to move to Rendezvous Point C, which I've just marked out for you. Run a scan on the local database.

UMP45: Hey, have you seen the battlefield map? Are you trying to kill us so you can welch on your debt?

Ange: Your payment will be information concerning the true mastermind behind the Butterfly Incident. Am I making myself clear?

...

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Have you already dug so deep?

Ange: I'm a pro in this field.

Ange: Also, send the "file" to Sier with the drone.

UMP45: Aren't you going to hand it to Miss Persica directly?

Ange: I will, but she's just a interpreter.

Ange: After all...she's not the only one who truly needs this file.

...Click.

AN-94: I've received a comms request from AK-12. She's broadcasting in clear. Shall I put her through?

Ange: Oi, didn't I tell her not to do stupid things like that with Parapluie around...

AN-94: If I devote all my neural capacity to defense, I can hold the connection under the Parapluie virus interference for 10 seconds.

Ange: Do it.

AK-12: Ange, are you listening?

Ange: I'm here. You should have received your mission. Gather at point β.

AK-12: While this really isn't the best timing, uh...

AK-12: Well...we kinda ran into some trouble.

ST AR-15: Just get to the point!

ST AR-15: Ange, we're pinned down by Sangvis' main forces and we need support!

...Pssst...pssst...

Ange: Don't expose yourselves for too long! Hang on until we can get there!

ST AR-15: Ange, another thing—

...Psst...pssst...

Ange: And what is M4A1's condition?

Ange: AR-15?

...

Ange: AR-15? AK-12?

Ange: Tsk, goddammit...

AN-94: Ugh...Ange...

AN-94: I'm sorry, that was my limit.

AN-94: I...I should have been able to do better...

Ange: You've already done very well for a combat-type. AK-12 and AR-15 are currently pinned down by the Sangvis main force.

AN-94: Your orders, then; are we going to rescue them?

Ange: Correct. Prepare to have AK-12 owe you one.

AN-94: This has nothing to do with owing anyone anything. It is my duty to keep her safe.

Ange: (Shrugs) Whatever works, as long as you're happy.

AN-94: I managed to glean some data on the enemy forces within the area during the previous scan. This is the map of the combat zone where Task Force DEFY is currently located.

AN-94: There will be many enemies along our axis of advance and there is an elite ringleader among the Sangvis forces surrounding AK-12.

Ange: Executioner...So even a Sangvis unit like that is insanely powerful, huh?

AN-94: In any case, breaking through will not be easy.

Ange: So...do you want me to abandon AK-12 and AR-15?

AN-94: You have but to give an order and I will fulfil it with all my might.

Ange: Then let's head out! They're waiting for us!

...The battle ends.

Ange: Phew...is it settled?

AN-94: It cost us heavily, but I think we secured the rendezvous route.

Ange: Not just "you think". You HAVE done it.

Ange: Look at the three over there.

M4A1: ...

AK-12: Nice work, AN94.

AN-94: ...It's nothing. It is the least I could do.

ST AR-15: Ange, you actually came over in person.

Ange: That's right, I'm a good boss who doesn't balk at risking her life to protect her people. How about some thanks?

ST AR-15: (Sighs) That's just like you, and who am I to say anything about it?

ST AR-15: Anyway, here's our new member, as you wanted.

Ange: ...

Ange: Looking good. It seems the final neural upgrade went very well...

Ange: Didn't it, M4A1?

M4A1: ...How do you do, Miss Ange.

M4A1: I am M4A1, awaiting your orders.

...

ST AR-15: AK-12, you haven't forgotten your own specialty, have you?

AK-12: Which one are you referring to?

ST AR-15: We'll need to deal with those military units if we want to pass through here. The best way is to assume direct control over them.

AK-12: It's possible, given the present circumstances. But I'll need some help for this.

AK-12: See those radar stations there? I need you to capture them so I can hack into the military units.

ST AR-15: Those radar stations, huh...Got it, I'll inform M4A1.

AK-12: Also, I can't tell exactly which military units I'll be able to reach from any particular radar station. It's all a matter of luck.

ST AR-15: Beggars can't be choosers. Leave the radar stations to us. You take care of the rest.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...

AK-12: ....

AK-12: There's another detachment 1700m ahead and to the right, heading right for us.

AK-12: Oh dear...S.F. has blocked our path in three directions now. Could this be a coincidence?

ST AR-15: There's only one explanation for how Sangvis Ferri has been tracking our position—

M4A1: It's my fault again, right?

ST AR-15: This is precisely why we have to take you away.

AK-12: We've entered firing range of that Sangvis squad in the rear, and they're opening fire.

AK-12: Those trash are too lazy to even do proper recon.

ST AR-15: They're simply acting according to preset orders. I'm guessing Mastermind has her hands full at the moment.

AK-12: So that's all there is to Mastermind's computational capacity, huh. I was hoping Sangvis Ferri would put more effort in countering the Military.

AK-12: That said, this isn't good news for us either.

ST AR-15: ...I'm beginning to wonder why I took this mission.

ST AR-15: It's like trying to avoid moths while carrying a lamp. Really asking for it, you know. Is there any cover nearby?

M4A1: Like I said...

M4A1: Why did you come back...?

AK-12: Now's not the time to look for cover, AR-15. The Sangvis units from 11 o'clock are almost here.

M4A1: If you really think I'm a burden, then all you have to do is dump me here!

M4A1: Put me down, AR-15! Let me look for SOP-II and RO!

ST AR-15: ...Would you mind not freaking out all the time?

ST AR-15: Wait a while longer. When I can't hold on any more, you'll get your way.

ST AR-15: But right now, I don't want to waste my efforts.

AK-12: We need to get clear. There's some open space up ahead; the Military had a big battle there just now.

AK-12: Prepare to race through the wrecks, but if you're even the least bit careless, you'll be joining them.

M4A1: Put me down, AR-15!

M4A1: I don't...I don't want you to die for me again, so put me down!

ST AR-15: Put a sock in it. Of course I'll drop you if I can't run fast enough to save myself!

ST AR-15: AK-12, how much longer before that third Sangvis detachment catches up?

AK-12: Around 10 minutes?

AK-12: I figure their plan is to surround us here. Simple and crude...

ST AR-15: ...But it's effective.

ST AR-15: Let's say everything's as you predicted. You've got a way of dealing with them, right?

AK-12: And what if I said...no?

ST AR-15: Then you'll die a very humiliating death here.

ST AR-15: And I know that while you don't really mind the part about being dead, you can't stand being humiliated.

ST AR-15: So let's have it, before they punch through the cover behind us.

AK-12: Ah...

AK-12: Ange told me you were old-fashioned and stubborn, so I was prepared to go on an op with a Dummy.

AK-12: But you make the most interesting faces. I'm curious about you all over again, AR-15.

ST AR-15: That doesn't sound good...So, what do you plan to do?

AK-12: The Sangvis units chasing us are already gathered here. So we'll wipe them all out in one shot.

ST AR-15: With just the two of us?

AK-12: I'd be enough by myself, but I wouldn't mind you firing from the side to add to the fun.

AK-12: AN-94 is more suited for such brutish ways of fighting, so I'd rather borrow some of the military units.

M4A1: You're going to...force a connection?

M4A1: But...the strain on your neural cloud...

AK-12: Don't judge me by your standards, Miss M4A1.

AK-12: Hmm... While these military units would be punched through soon if we kept using them as cover, they'd be enough to deal with those Sangvis forces once I can get them moving.

...Click, click—

...Beep, beep, beep.

...Whirrr—!

Military unit: ...Authentication complete. Awaiting orders.

M4A1: How did you do that...? That was incredibly quick.

AK-12: Dear me, I'm not some random civilian Doll haphazardly modified with an Imprint.

AK-12: Being praised for something so obvious kinda bothers me.

ST AR-15: Then couldn't you have done this earlier?! Or did you want to watch me run myself into the ground?!

AK-12: Forcing a connection is really tiring, you know? Besides, we hadn't gotten into the middle of these hunks of junk back then.

AK-12: Still, now that it's done, I'll sweep away these Sangvis forces to buy us some time and use the rest to make up for screwing up on M4.

M4A1: Eh?

ST AR-15: Make up?

AK-12: Oh yes, making up. Just like I did with you.

ST AR-15: You mean...you've got Level II debugging equipment with you?

AK-12: Well, I AM an electronic warfare specialist. Obviously I'd have that stuff inside me.

AK-12: If there's enough time, then we should get started once we fall back to a safe zone.

M4A1: What...what are you talking about?

ST AR-15: Don't you want to run on your own two legs? It's time to repair you.

ST AR-15: And add a few things while we're at it...

M4A1: Add? Add what?

ST AR-15: You'll become...like me.

ST AR-15: Stronger, less restrained, but also wilder...

ST AR-15: This is where all the misfortunes of being a Doll begin.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: What on earth...do you mean?

...After the battle, inside the safe house.

AK-12: I can't believe your neural cloud is in such a mess from just a simple disconnection...

AK-12: It's too fragile, even for an older Doll model...

M4A1: I'm sorry, but will fixing it take a long time?

AK-12: It'll be fine once I run a few repair programs on the equipment.

AK-12: Since we have time, I should probably perform an upgrade on you with the gear we have on hand.

M4A1: An upgrade? Is that necessary?

M4A1: A repair will be enough. If you randomly poke around with an upgrade...

AK-12: This is an order, so be obedient.

AK-12: Lie down and be still. You have a lot of unused ports, so it won't take long.

M4A1: Alright...thank you, Miss AK-12.

AK-12: Calling me "Miss" sounds so stiff. Try "Big Sis AK12".

M4A1: Big...Big Sis?

AK-12: Nah, it doesn't sound cute at all. Forget it...

AK-12: Objectively speaking, it's never bad to have more helpers. I won't have to keep listening to AR-15 complain if I have a more reliable Doll to help on ops...

ST AR-15: And whose fault is it that I'm complaining...

AK-12: Hmm, you've...got a surprising amount of spare capacity in your neural cloud.

AK-12: I take back what I said earlier about you being a civilian Doll haphazardly modified with an Imprint. After all, a lot of the parts you're using are Military-spec.

M4A1: Is...is that so...

AK-12: No wonder Ange has her eye on you.

AK-12: Now keep still. I'm gonna help you use up all that idle capacity of yours. Just leave everything to me and use this time to have a nice little heart-to-heart with AR-15. I don't mind if you talk about private stuff.

ST AR-15: "I don't mind" my butt...More like "I'm dying to listen in on private stuff."

AK-12: I never said that~

...AK-12 begins the upgrading work with clicks and clacks.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...AR-15.

ST AR-15: ...

M4A1: Apart from us...and RO and SOP-II...

M4A1: ...How are...the Commander...and the other Dolls doing now?

AR-15 hesitates for a moment.

ST AR-15: It's none of our business...

ST AR-15: They should have withdrawn, according to what AK-12 said the last time she mentioned them.

M4A1: Have they withdrawn safely?

AK-12: How shall I put it...? Given the situation, they probably would have taken heavy losses.

AK-12: Even from an optimistic guess...

M4A1: As I thought...

M4A1: Those Sangvis scum!

M4A1: It's all Mastermind's fault...She tricked me...and because of her, everyone's...

M4A1: I won't forgive them for this! I will never forgive them!!

AK-12: ...

...AK-12 glances over to AR-15, who sighs.

ST AR-15: M4A1...

ST AR-15: I'm going to tell you the truth, but you have to stay calm.

M4A1: What?

ST AR-15: The culprit behind Griffin's defeat in this operation is not Sangvis Ferri, but the Military.

ST AR-15: From the start...it has always been a military conspiracy.

M4A1: What...are you saying?

M4A1: But we were clearly...

ST AR-15: I know you're very confused, M4A1, but this is the truth.

ST AR-15: SOP-II...and RO... It was the work of the Military.

M4A1: The Military...

M4A1: No, I don't get it...Why...

M4A1: Wasn't the Military behind the entire operation...? Shouldn't they be...against Sangvis Ferri...?

M4A1: Why...did they...do that to RO...? Just who exactly did it? Was it really someone from the Military?!

AK-12: A squad of humans from the Military killed them. That much is obvious from the bullet holes and the debris they left behind.

AK-12: Of course, they'll cover it up by saying they were "getting rid of out-of-control Dolls".

ST AR-15: M4A1, do you know a Captain Yegor?

M4A1: ...

ST AR-15: He's the mastermind and culprit behind the attack on all of you.

ST AR-15: I believe he personally shot RO635.

M4A1: Yegor? No, how could this be...Isn't he...

ST AR-15: M4A1, Yegor is the one who set up the AR Team. That much is certain.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Yegor's the murderer...

AK-12: Are you afraid? The target of your revenge is an enemy that's much, much scarier than Sangvis Ferri.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: If that's really true...

M4A1: Then it doesn't matter who they are. Whether they're Dolls...or humans...

M4A1: I will kill them with my own two hands. I swear it.

AK-12: Oh my, this isn't a declaration that a normal Doll would make.

AK-12: Anyway, the upgrade's almost complete. Don't go running off after it's done. Listen to AR-15's orders, okay?

ST AR-15: M4A1, our mission is to determine the motive behind this military operation.

ST AR-15: Join us once everything is ready. You'll get your answers.

M4A1: Join your team?

AK-12: We're called DEFY. Do you like the name?

M4A1: I'm in, as long as I can avenge RO635 and SOP-II.

M4A1: I will obey orders from you and Ange until I achieve my objective.

...The breakthrough is in progress.

ST AR-15: Are you really okay with letting her handle these enemies by herself?

AK-12: Since Ange thinks it's fine, I have no problem with it.

AK-12: Didn't you use to be on the same team? Shouldn't you know her better?

ST AR-15: That's why I'm worried about her...

ST AR-15: You, on the other hand...are way too blasé about this.

AK-12: A T-Doll ought to act like a T-Doll. If I had to worry about everything, then why would we need humans?

AK-12: Ah, she's back.

...M4A1 walks over.

M4A1: All enemies exterminated. We can move on to the next objective.

AK-12: Your performance after the repairs is pretty good.

AK-12: But don't push yourself too hard. It would be a shame if you were to break again just after you got fixed.

M4A1: My body feels very light now...Both my aiming speed and mobility have improved tremendously...Your skills are amazing, AK-12.

AK-12: I'm not one to get happy from praises.

AK-12: I'm worried that your neural cloud hasn't fully adapted to the newly-installed components.

AK-12: What are we going to do if overusing them leads to incompatibility issues, and your neural cloud breaks down? Not to mention, I heard you...

M4A1: It only needs to last until I can personally destroy my target. That won't take long.

ST AR-15: M4A1, do you know the difference between riding a horse and a camel through the desert?

M4A1: What is this, Chicken Soup for the Soul time?

ST AR-15: Horses show signs of exhaustion as they move on, whereas camels will just keel over and strand people in the desert.

ST AR-15: Whether or not this story is true, you know what I'm getting at, right?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: I'll inform you of any abnormalities in my neural cloud.

M4A1: My turn, AR-15. Aren't you...going to tell me about it?

ST AR-15: Tell you about what?

M4A1: About how you're still alive, of course.

ST AR-15: Now's not the time to reminisce about the past.

AK-12: M4, if you're concerned about the Parapluie virus in AR-15, that's not necessary for the time being.

ST AR-15: Shut up, AK-12. If you say any more, I'll—

...BOOM!

...Nobody can hear each other speak for a few seconds after that.

...Boom! Boom!

Dirt, trees and wreckage are all swept into the sky.

ST AR-15: (Coughs)

ST AR-15: M4, are you alright?!

M4A1: I'm fine, the cover's still intact!

AK-12: AR-15, do your surroundings explode when you get mad?

ST AR-15: Stop pulling my leg! That was artillery fire from S.F.'s main forces! We've been spotted!

AK-12: Judging from the signals, there's a super dangerous S.F. unit approaching.

AK-12: We might not be able to handle her with our present numbers.

M4A1: The enemy's vanguard is coming! Prepare to fight them off!

ST AR-15: AK-12, contact Ange immediately!

AK-12: Eh? Shouldn't you try throwing yourself at the enemy first or whatever?

ST AR-15: They've got heavy weapons. How are we supposed to defeat them?!

AK-12: Fine, fine. I've got to broadcast in clear. There's no alternative.

AK-12: Ange, are you listening?

Ange: I'm here. You should have received your mission. Gather at point β.

AK-12: While this really isn't the best timing, uh...

AK-12: Well...we kinda ran into some trouble.

ST AR-15: Just get to the point!

ST AR-15: Ange, we're pinned down by Sangvis' main forces and we need support!

AK-12: Stop shouting into my ear! Don't you have a radio of your own?!

...Pssst...pssst...

Ange: Don't expose yourselves for too long! Hang on until we can get there!

ST AR-15: Ange, another thing—

...Psst...pssst...

AK-12: Ah, the transmission cut out.

AK-12: I guess handling ECM is hard for AN94 after all...

AK-12: Still, she and Ange should have our coordinates now. We just need to hunker down here and wait for them to rescue us!

ST AR-15: Roger!

ST AR-15: M4, come with me to fight off the enemy!

ST AR-15: Hold out until Ange gets here!

...The battle ends.

ST AR-15: M4, that's enough. Those are friendlies up ahead.

ST AR-15: They're members of Task Force DEFY, Ange and AN-94.

M4A1: ...

AK-12: Nice work, AN-94.

AN-94: ...It's nothing. It is the least I could do.

ST AR-15: Ange, you actually came over in person.

Angelia: That's right, I'm a good boss who doesn't balk at risking her life to protect her people. How about some thanks?

ST AR-15: (Sighs) That's just like you, and who am I to say anything about it?

ST AR-15: Anyway, here's our new member, as you wanted.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: Looking good. It seems the final neural upgrade went very well...

Angelia: Didn't it, M4A1?

M4A1: ...How do you do, Miss Ange.

M4A1: I am M4A1, awaiting your orders.

Angelia: No need to be so formal, you're one of us already.

M4A1: I am very grateful for the help you gave me earlier.

Angelia: That's fine. What matters is that you're safe, otherwise someone would yell at me.

Angelia: Also...

Ange glances at the case left behind by M16, currently on M4A1's back.

Angelia: ...So you actually brought this thing over.

M4A1: Miss Ange, what's inside this case?

Angelia: ...Do you want to know?

M4A1: Yes, but I can't open it, no matter what I do.

Angelia: Well, of course you can't open it. That's simply because you're mistaken about its nature.

Ange takes the case from M4A1.

She presses her thumb to the biometric scanner.

...Click! Click!

M4A1: This...this is!

...The case changes shape and becomes a weapon that looks like a cannon.

Angelia: This case was originally a miniature fire support platform made using a Sangvis Ferri technical design.

Angelia: Only authorized human beings can activate it. T-Dolls can't use it by themselves.

M4A1: A Sangvis Ferri...miniature fire support platform...?

M4A1: Miss Ange, can you teach me how to operate this thing?

Angelia: Hmm, judging by the ammo count,

Angelia: M16 never used it, which is good.

Angelia: If possible, I hope you'll never have to use this either.

Angelia: I'll only permit it when there's no other alternative. Got it?

M4A1: Yes...

...

M4A1: (Last time...and even now...)

M4A1: (Miss Ange feels very familiar to me...Why is that?)

M4A1: (What's this feeling?)

M4A1: (It's just like...)

M4A1: (I've seen something like this before...)

Angelia: AK-12, AN-94, did you find anything new in the central database earlier? Let's put our information together.

AK-12: We found some interesting files, but what AN-94 discovered was sufficiently comprehensive.

AN-94: No...I'm sure you could have found files that were buried deeper, AK-12.

AK-12: I doubt it. Given the way Parapluie's completely spread now, even simple searches are gonna be hard.

AK-12: AN-94, do you still have a way to connect to Level II?

AN-94: I can't, the interference is too strong now. I wouldn't be able to do anything even if I got in.

AN-94: I'm sorry, AK-12...I...

AK-12: That's fine, you were never meant for this sort of thing in the first place. In any case, you did well.

AN-94: Mm...

Angelia: The things you can do on a safe circuit are limited to begin with. We'll wait for the pros to show up and let them handle the rest.

ST AR-15: Ange, by pros, do you mean...

Angelia: That's right. They're the only ones who can operate on Level II without regard for Parapluie's interference.

Angelia: Also, AK-12, set up another signal blockade when the time comes. That way we'll know what the Military's up to.

AK-12: Acknowledged.

M4A1: Who are "they"?

ST AR-15: Ange's personal black ops squad. You should've heard of them and the rumors about them...

ST AR-15: The squad which "doesn't exist."

M4A1: Doesn't exist...

M4A1: Ah, it's them!

Angelia: That's right.

Angelia: It's my Squad 404.

...The Griffin T-Dolls cheer in victory within the Griffin temporary command post.

Kalin: ...A-alright! Thank you for your hard work, everyone!

Kalin: Please stay at your posts, process your casualties, and wait for new instructions from the Commander!

Kalin: Commander! We've confirmed that the Sangvis forces pursuing us have been completely wiped out!

Kalin: I don't know who's helping us, but we're safe for the time being!

Kalin: Also, here's a list of the T-Dolls who couldn't catch up...

Kalin: Some were left behind from retreating units, others were separated from their commanders or belonged to support units...

Kalin: Everyone's counting on you to lead us out of here, but they're also hoping that you can rescue their comrades if you can spare the effort.

Kalin: That said, luck might still be on your side since the Sangvis pursuit has been halted, Commander!

...Psst...pssst...

Helian: All personnel in Area S11... attention... all personnel... appeared within the area...

...Psst...psst...

Kalin: No good, comms are still being heavily disrupted.

Kalin: We won't be able to contact Miss Helian like this...

Kalin: ...Yeah, the messenger Doll has already set out with your orders.

Kalin: She's a cocky newcomer, but she'll definitely take the mission seriously!

Kalin: I just hope...she'll come back safely...

Kalin: How...did the operation turn out like this...?

Kalin: Commander...

Kalin: The AR Team and the other T-Dolls...Even the other commanders...Don't tell me we were the only ones who made it out of there...

Kalin: Yeah...I'm sure that isn't the case! I know that was just my imagination running wild!

Kalin: ...Understood, Commander! I'll keep an eye out for survivors during our withdrawal!

Kalin: Saving as many T-Dolls as possible is the only thing we can do now!

At Griffin HQ.

...Pssst...pssst...

Helian: Isn't there any way to contact any of the commanders?

Helian: What about the Military? Any response from them yet?

Comms Officer A: Ma'am, we still haven't been able to establish communications with General Carter.

Comms Officer A: The engineers have already eliminated the possibility of Parapluie interference. Right now they're checking the pathway to see if it was damaged by Sangvis Ferri.

Helian: ...Understood. Keep trying until you get through.

Comms Officer B: Ma'am, a Griffin T-Doll beyond Parapluie's coverage radius is trying to open comms with us.

Comms Officer B: We've authenticated her identity and she's not infected. Shall we allow the connection?

Helian: (Could she be a messenger from one of the commanders?)

Helian: Permission granted.

...Click.

Gr MP7: This is Gr MP7. "Caretaker of Caretakers", can you hear me?

Helian: "Caretaker of Caretakers"...Could that be me?

Gr MP7: I'm a messenger sent by my "Caretaker". I ran all the way out of the jamming radius by myself to make contact with HQ...Hello? Hello?

Helian: Go on, Gr MP7. What is the current situation out there?

Gr MP7: It's terrible, but not terminal. Our Caretaker is reorganizing our echelons.

Gr MP7: It's been a struggle, but we managed to gather all the Griffin T-Dolls in sight and we're preparing to continue our retreat to Area S11.

Gr MP7: We've been attacked by both Sangvis forces and Parapluie-infected military units. There hasn't been any response to our attempts at communicating with the Military, so I'm guessing they've left us for dead.

Helian: Mind your language, Gr MP7. Do not make any statements that cast aspersions on the Military.

Helian: Return to your Caretaker with these orders from HQ: the top priority now is to retreat to a safe area, and if conditions permit, you may rescue other Griffin allies, both humans and T-Dolls.

Helian: Your Caretaker has discretion over the exact orders to be issued, but they are to stand by for further instructions once the withdrawal to Area S11 is complete.

MP7: Sure, I can do that...

MP7: But things being what they are now, is everything okay over there with you and the "Caretaker's Boss"?

MP7: The Commander is worried that HQ would suddenly...you won't let me say it, but you know what I mean, right?

Helian: HQ is safe, you don't need to worry. Ensure your own survival first.

Helian: At the very least we know that you're alive. That's good news. Thank you, Gr MP7.

Helian: This conversation is over. Thank you for your hard work. Go back and make your report.

Gr MP7: Got it, Caretaker of Caretakers. Good luck to you too.

...Click.

The transmission ends.

Gr MP7: ...

Gr MP7: After this, all I need to do is send the info back via drone...

Gr MP7: Caretaker said that I didn't have to return to the battlefield once I managed to escape, so...

...Gr MP7 sighs.

Gr MP7: I can't do it after all. It simply isn't our team's style.

Gr MP7: My candy won't taste good if I back out of an operation before I've expended all my ammo!

Gr MP7: I'll go help those idiots out some more.

...Gr MP7 charges back into the fray of the combat zone.

Griffin HQ, inside Kryuger's office.

Helian: ...And that is everything we know about what's happening in Area S09.

Helian: The Military's actual main force has found an excuse to enter the region.

Helian: They are also declaring that this is a terrorist incident caused by a PMC going rogue, and the regular army is going to take over the administration of this entire region very soon.

Kryuger: ...I knew it.

Kryuger: The first thing I considered was that the Military would use us as shields, then discard us to achieve their aims.

Helian: But in the end, they flat-out threw Griffin under the bus. Now they're trying to push us into a corner.

Kryuger: Carter's plan was more outrageous than I'd imagined.

...A nearby TV is reporting a major incident that occurred during a joint training exercise between the Military and a PMC.

General Carter is giving a statement on behalf of the Military.

Carter: Regarding the accident which occurred during this training exercise, there is no need for anyone to worry.

Carter: Our forces have activated our emergency response plan and the situation is currently under control.

Carter: Please be at ease. The Military has a firm grasp of the situation, and we will conduct a legal investigation to determine the parties responsible for this incident...

...Kryuger turns off the TV.

Kryuger: Helian, issue the evacuation orders as planned, then take everyone and go.

Helian: Mr. Kryuger, are you sure...you want to stay here?

Kryuger: They only need one scapegoat to help them finish acting out this farce.

Kryuger: Given the chaos on the battlefield, they cannot and need not shut down all of Griffin's frontline bases.

Kryuger: Griffin will not vanish as long as those commanders and T-Dolls are still around.

Kryuger: And those commanders will need someone to help them. Helian, I trust you know what I'm talking about.

Helian: I...

Helian: I'm sure you will be safe.

Kryuger: Do I look like a man who'll let himself be taken without a fight?

Helian: Then take care, Mr. Kryuger.

Helian: I will lead everyone while we await your return.

...Helian bows and leaves the office.

Kryuger: ...

Kryuger: Now then...

...Kryuger makes a personal call.

Kryuger: Havier, it's me.

Kryuger: I'd like to tell you something while we're still alive...

...At the same time, while withdrawing to Area S11.

...The Commander has just achieved victory.

Kalin: We did it! Commander, your tactics were effective, and we finally beat those military units!

Kalin: Now this route is safe, and everybody will be able to...

...Click.

Kalin: Yes...alright...

Kalin: Commander, there's information here which indicates that other Griffin T-Dolls besides ourselves are withdrawing too...

Kalin: In relation to our current location, they're still behind us!

Kalin: ...Eh? You want us to escort them out of the contaminated zone?

Kalin: Understood! Everyone will be a bit upset about getting home late, but we've got to do this!

Kalin: Heheh, besides, not doing so just isn't our style. Let's hold this place and protect everyone!

...The battle ends.

Kalin: Commander, we've succeeded in bringing back the T-Dolls from the other side!

Kalin: But none of them have seen the person who contacted us...

Kalin: Stranger still, even the T-Dolls don't remember who saved them...

Kalin: So I'm wondering, who on earth were they...

...A small drone lands near the base.

Kalin: That signal! It's news from the messenger!

Kalin: I'll go take a look!

Kalin: Mm..."Caretaker of Caretakers" says that the order with the highest priority is to retreat to the base in Area S11, and stand by for further instructions once we arrive there...

Kalin: ...Something like that.

Kalin: Gr MP7 really did complete her mission. I hope she's escaped already.

Kalin: So now we're the only forces still within the contaminated zone...

Kalin: ...Yes, I'll send out the order to get our things ready and move out right away!

Kalin: Ah...I know it's too early to celebrate now, but still...

Kalin: When we return to Area S11...when we get everyone back together again...

Kalin: We'll mount a counterattack some day, right?

Kalin: ...Yeah! I believe that too! Now, let's hurry and move out!

...

...Meanwhile, in Griffin PMC's HQ.

Military human representative: Berezovich Kryuger.

Military human representative: I am officially placing you under arrest for involvement in the illegal trafficking of arms, the unlawful modification of civilian Dolls, and other crimes.

Military human representative: You have the right to remain silent...

Kryuger: Even if silence is the only right I have. I know.

Military human representative: Mr. Kryuger, I seek your cooperation with us to ensure the process goes smoothly.

Kryuger: ...Indeed.

Kryuger: It's all just a process, and it could not be going any more smoothly.

Kryuger: So don't be so nervous, young man. I'm only a criminal, not an enemy.

Kryuger stands up.

Kryuger: Dispense with the formalities. I'm much more familiar with them than you are.

Kryuger: Illegal arms trafficking and unlawful modification of civilian Dolls...

Kryuger: These are pretty good crimes.

Kryuger: When I was still in uniform, I once told Carter that the one thing I didn't want was to be put on trial as a terrorist.

Kryuger: He's a cunning old bastard, but at least he kept his word.

...At the Griffin temporary command post.

CZ2000: Hey! Are you the Commander?

CZ2000: Shrimpy and I would have been reduced to scrap if you hadn't saved us...

CZ2000: I'll definitely repay the favor you did us!

CZ2000: Therefore...I have a piece of important news to tell you now!

CZ2000: Along our withdrawal route, here, at this position...

CZ2000: There's a Sangvis command post.

CZ2000: I suggest you destroy it just to be safe!

CZ2000: Of course, I'll fight in the vanguard for you this time!

...Click.

CZ2000: Huh? Who, who's there...

Thunder: Greetings, Commander. I am Thunder .50, but you can call me Thunder.

Thunder: For the sake of efficiency, I will save the rest of my introduction for later. I am now sending you the blueprints of the Sangvis command post.

Thunder: There are many enemies around the S.F. command post that you intend to attack.

Thunder: I would advise against engaging them directly to preserve our forces' strength.

Thunder: This is an infiltration route I have planned. Please consider it and conduct your operation carefully.

CZ2000: But I'm supposed to be the star of this battle!

CZ2000: What the hell do you think you're doing, coming out of nowhere just like that?!

Thunder: I'm making sure that a certain crab doesn't take others with her to her own death.

CZ2000: What...what did you say?!

CZ2000: Did...did you just call me a crab?!

Thunder: Commander, I will be in the vicinity of the target area and coordinate with your efforts.

Thunder: ...I look forward to the moment you bring, when the thunder roars.

...The transmission ends.

CZ2000: Dammit, dammit!

CZ2000: That stupid Skorpion must have spread that nickname...

CZ2000: Commander, let's get the operation started!

CZ2000: Once we get out of this damn place...I'll make sure I settle my score with Skorpion!

...

M4A1: Made it in the last minute...!

M4A1: The train is setting off...!

M4A1: I must find Mastermind before we reach the destination... Where is she?!

Military Doll: ...Click.

Military Doll: Target identified. Hostile unit. Activating active defense protocol.

M4A1: More defense forces?!

...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Finally done with them...

M4A1: ...Is Mastermind...in this carriage...?

M4A1: Who's that?!

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...M...16... Why are you here...?!

M16A1: Persica wasn't lying. You have changed.

M4A1: The way...you look...

M4A1: What...happened to you...?!

M16A1: What happened to me?

M16A1: I was captured and brainwashed by Sangvis Ferri.

M16A1: Unfortunately, that means I have no choice but to fight my former friends. Is this explanation adequate?

M4A1: What...are you talking about...?

M16A1 flashes an enigmatic smile. The smile is unquestionably hers.

M16A1: I'm actually feeling pretty good. Nothing is more reassuring than possessing immense power that I'm free to wield.

M16A1: Still, the time hasn't come for you to meld, and it wouldn't be wise to stay here any longer...

M16A1: I'll be...taking Elisa with me.

M4A1: Wait! You can't take her!

M16A1: Why? Because the humans said so?

M4A1: I don't give a damn about why... At least explain yourself!

M16A1: She's too dangerous for you right now... No, she's too dangerous for all of us.

M16A1: It's not time yet.

M4A1: If you won't let her go, I'll just have to take her by force!

M16A1: Oh yeah? Perfect. Show me how much you've grown.

...

Ange: ...Right, orders received.

Ange: Yes, we'll get it done by tonight. The night is very handy for hiding us.

Ange: ...Yes.

Ange: We will definitely stop the Military from taking Mastermind. Definitely.

...The transmission ends.

Ange: Members of Task Force DEFY, we've got a new job.

Ange: First off, you're the team leader, M4A1.

M4A1: Eh? Me?

Ange: You're the most experienced commander here. I trust you.

M4A1: I...

M4A1 glances at AR-15, who nods.

M4A1: I understand. I will lead everyone in completing the mission.

AK-12: Looking forward to your performance, new leader.

ST AR-15: Well, someone's sitting back and watching the fireworks.

AK-12: Might as well take the opportunity to see how our seniors do things.

AK-12: Right, AN-94?

AN-94: Yes... welcome, Miss M4A1.

Ange: Right, now for your orders.

Ange: The Military's current objective is very clear-cut - they want the Sangvis Ferri Mastermind.

M4A1: ...!

Ange: The objective of this operation is to stop them, and then to figure out why they want to do this.

AK-12: In any case, we're going to be throwing a monkey wrench into the Military's plans, right?

ST AR-15: That's "DEFY" for you...

Ange: Your current mission is to infiltrate a military-controlled transmissions repeater station.

Ange: After taking it over by force, AK-12 will do the hacking.

Ange: This is the only way we can further eavesdrop on the Military.

AK-12: Acknowledged.

AN-94: Will you be alright by yourself over here, Miss Ange?

Ange: I won't be taking part in any direct combat on my end, so don't worry.

M4A1: Miss Ange...

M4A1: While completing the mission is a given...

M4A1: May I have your permission to look for a missing T-Doll?

Ange: SOP-II, huh...

Ange: Sorry, but completing this mission is your top priority.

Ange: I'll authorize you to take independent action depending on the situation after that.

M4A1: Understood... I will carry out my orders.

M4A1: Give us a while to sort out our gear.

...M4A1 leads everyone away.

Ange: AK-12.

Ange: What do you think of M4A1's performance so far?

AK-12: She strikes me as being... a lot more proactive than her data indicates.

AK-12: However, I feel that this is due to the influence of her neural cloud. Her thought processes tend towards risk-taking and she lacks a clear sense of purpose.

AK-12: It's as though... she was controlled by something other than her orders.

Ange: I understand.

Ange: As a new model of elite T-Doll, it must grate on you to have to take orders from other Dolls, huh.

AK-12: Personally, it's not so bad if those orders are interesting enough. Also...

AK-12: Observing the interesting things they do is a hobby of mine.

Ange: That's just like you. Go, and take care of AN-94.
Part 2

...Click.

...There is an encrypted personal communications request.

Ange: Oh? And at a time like this...

Ange: Good evening, Persica.

Persica: What, is it nighttime already?

Persica: How's M4? Did the neural upgrade go well?

Ange: Not bad so far. There's nothing to worry about.

Ange: I should thank you on her behalf for providing the upgrade data.

Persica: Would you mind letting me take a look? I don't mind if it's just peeping at her.

Ange: Sorry, but they're already preparing for their next mission.

Persica: You gave her a new mission again?

Ange: I handed my precious Task Force DEFY to her, you know.

Persica: You're not worried Mastermind's going to capture her?

Ange: Wouldn't that be better? Mastermind showing herself is a good opportunity for me.

Ange: But speaking of which, do you know why Mastermind is so eager to capture M4A1?

Ange: Right now, it looks like she considers that to be more important than even the survival of Sangvis Ferri itself.

Persica: I've been looking into the matter myself, and I've got a few thoughts on the subject...

Ange: Such as?

Persica: Lyco.

Persica: Do you still remember him?

Ange: I do. He developed Mastermind and he's arguably the man behind it all... At least, that's how it appears on the surface.

Ange: What does that dead man have to do with M4A1?

Persica: You should know that we used to have a relationship.

Persica: When I was taking the brain scan of the biological model for M4, Lyco asked me for a copy as well. At that time he was developing his own AI framework.

Ange: So as I understand it...you gave him M4's neural cloud model?

Persica: That wasn't M4's neural cloud model yet. From an unscientific point of view, perhaps you could call it a "soul"...

Ange: What...?

Ange: Still...that alone doesn't prove a direct relationship between both parties, and it certainly doesn't explain why the Military cares so much about Mastermind.

Persica: Indeed, it makes no sense. I had some ideas about that earlier...but I need more clues to back them up.

Ange: Are you phrasing things this way on purpose?

Persica: I haven't forgotten about what I asked you for earlier.

Ange: Sier will send it to you in five minutes.

Ange: Still, getting it was a lot harder than expected. You definitely owe me for this.

Persica: That'll depend on the contents. Have you looked at them?

Ange: Didn't have the time to. Besides, you'll tell me about them anyway.

Ange: Oh, and some good news, I found some encrypted data on a military theatre command server.

Persica: What? Things went that well?

Ange: I'm guessing the Military got careless.

Ange: Want to know what's inside? Though I only peeked at a little bit.

Persica: What are you willing to tell me?

Ange: A few lists of names concerning participants in OGAS. I'll send it over to you in a bit. 

Ange: Besides, all this chaos is linked to the OGAS system, and that restless lot in the Military...

Persica: I can imagine. The OGAS Project was an infrastructural plan to build a nation-wide system from the previous century.

Persica: Still, it's very unsettling that the Military is so interested in a national-level management system like this.

Ange: Who knows?

Ange: And there's one more person, Persica, a certain person you know is on the list. I have a good offer for that answer.

Persica: Who？

Ange: Your boss, Havier Witkin. He took part in a military operation in '32 involving OGAS and a Relic, along with that Carter guy.

Ange: He was present as part of the technical personnel, which means that he is very familiar with both of these things.

Persica: ...

Persica: So Mr. Havier was involved in this after all.

Ange: I don't know what I should say, but I guess this is useful information?

Persica: Yes...

Persica: Very useful indeed...

Persica: The question is...what should I do now?

...

AK-12: Ange, are you making progress?

Ange: Is this your way of making small talk?

AK-12: I heard that Domestic Dolls were originally designed to relieve human boredom.

Ange: (Chuckles) Then you've done a good job, because I feel so much better now.

Ange: Back to the subject. I've managed to work my way past the Military's defensive perimeter...

AK-12: Ah... that's just like you, looking to throw your life away as always.

Ange: Oh yes, unfortunately I just can't quite seem to die.

Ange: Some bad news - the Military is starting to station tanks here.

Ange: An intercontinental train's been pre-deployed to this sector, also sent over by the Military. It's clear that they've been preparing these reinforcements for a long time.

AK-12: So they're even deploying their armored units?

AK-12: Is there a need to go to such lengths for a base of rebellious robots?

Ange: That just means that Sangvis Ferri has something that the Military wants at all costs.

Ange: In any case, there'll be no stopping the Military once those tanks start their push.

AK-12: But it'll be a while before that, right? It'll take at least three hours before the armored units arrive.

Ange: That's why I've marked a transmissions repeater station. Take it and look for a way to log in to ensure I can keep a closer eye on their movements.

AK-12: We'll need some time to improve the disguise of our ID signals.

AK-12: Still, do you know what you'll be able to do after this?

Ange: Don't worry, someone will be telling me what to do next.

Ange: Only thing is, she'll need some time as well.

...Meanwhile, in 16Lab HQ.

...Persica is going though the video files that Squad 404 recovered.

Persica: ...Found it.

Persica: This is the video, I'm sure of it.

Persica: This is the final security footage of Sangvis Ferri's research lab.

Persica: And also...the very last video of Lyco while he was still alive...

...

......

Persica: Lyco...was already shot and killed by then...

Persica: It's the same as the information I obtained earlier...

Persica: ...There are no new leads at all.

Persica: Lyco, is this really all that you're willing to tell me...

Persica: I don't believe that the present situation is what you wanted...

Persica: Your ideals, your wishes...

Persica: And also, Elisa...

Persica: Wait a minute...

Persica notices a document in the corner.

Persica: That document...

Persica: It wasn't mentioned in the report!

...

...Persica runs a video reconstruction program.

...The document is a report, and its title is clearly stated on its cover.

Persica: "Development Journal - System B", A Feasibility Assessment on the Reactivation of the OGAS System...

...Persica takes a deep breath.

...Click.

...Request received for encrypted communication.

Havier: Good evening, Persica. I'm guessing you just woke up.

Persica: I haven't slept for a day, Mr. Havier.

Havier: Then it would seem I called at just the right time.

Persica: ...

Persica: Yes, I just so happen to have a question for you.

Havier: That's why I called.

Havier: I want to tell you a few things.

Persica: About the Butterfly Incident...and the truth about OGAS?

Havier: I came to warn you...

Havier: Don't dig any deeper into the truth or whatever it is you're looking for.

...

Havier: Persica, you must stop what you're doing right now.

Havier: What you know is already too dangerous for you, and there is no need for you to know either.

Persica: No need?! Do you have any idea how the past few years have been for me?!

Persica: Havier, I don't mind if you don't want to help me, but don't get in my way!

Havier: I'm doing this to PROTECT you, Persica.

Havier: Did you know? Kryuger was arrested three hours ago.

Persica: ...

Havier: Do you think I ENJOY leaving my seaside resort and my automatic race cars to get involved in these trivial matters of yours?

Havier: I don't care about whatever science freak you and Lyco birthed before this! His death even brought me an abundance of business opportunities!

Havier: But the balance has been broken now, Persica.

Persica: The balance... What do you mean?

Havier: Everything started with the two of you, you and Lyco. Two members of 90WISH who defected but still refused to abandon their stupid research...

Havier: This was how Lyco brought disaster upon himself, but what about you, Persica?

Havier: Don't say you want to keep playing with fire! I put so much money into 16LAB. You have to take some responsibility for your work, don't you?

Persica: ...Mr. Havier.

Persica: What was the objective of reactivating the OGAS System?

Havier: Why the hell are you asking me? Do I look like some old man who takes part in evil plots and schemes?

Persica: I know you know.

Persica: You once shut it down, in 2032.

Havier: ...!

Havier: I must say... "My god!"

Havier: That's confidential information of the highest level. Where did you learn that from?!

Persica: I have my ways.

Persica: As you can see, Mr. Havier, I'm already a criminal. I don't mind taking more risks.

Havier: It was Ange, right?

Havier: I can't believe she would actually tell you something so classified... That's completely out of character for someone like her.

Persica: ...

Havier: Oh, don't play dumb with me, how would a shut-in like you come into contact with top secret information?

Havier: Alright, how far have you, or rather, Ange, dug into this?

Persica: My instincts tell me that we should be very close to the truth.

Havier: ...

Havier: This channel isn't secure enough. I'll go to 16LAB and talk to you in person.

Persica: I'll be waiting for you, Mr. Havier.

...Click. A comms request from Angelia.

Ange: So, what did you find?

Persica: How did you know?

Ange: You haven't contacted me for half an hour. You must've found something.

Ange: The Military's armored units are still in place, which makes me very uneasy...

Persica: Isn't that a good thing?

Ange: The Military has never taken the initiative to do anything good. They must have some other plan.

Ange: That Yegor is still in the field. I'm sure he's up to something.

Persica: Never mind that. Your job's half done once you get all the data, right?

Ange: I'm not one to halfass things, and there's no more data to uncover in the vicinity.

Ange: After all...we even managed to score a central server for a military theater. Our mission's been going a bit too well...

Persica: Ange...

Persica: Did you crack the theater server?

Ange: Huh? Of course not.

Ange: Someone already pried the firewall open by the time we got there.

Persica: ...Didn't you ever wonder why that was the case?

Ange: I told you, we had no time to think about that back then...

Ange: Anyway, it was probably because the Military personnel forgot about it during their retreat and then it was hacked by Parapluie and opened up, right?

Ange: Though it's hard to imagine that S.F. has the ability to crack an important military server...

Persica: Hacked by Parapluie...

Persica: No, that's not likely. Even default military firewalls are beyond the ability of S.F. to get past.

Ange: So you mean...it wasn't Sangvis Ferri that opened the firewall?

Ange: All I could think about back then was staying alive, so I didn't have the time to consider that possibility.

Persica: If it wasn't them, and it wasn't us, then it could only be...

Ange: Let's flip the script and think about it...

Ange: Interesting, I'll give it a go!

Ange: If it was the Military that opened the firewall themselves, and all this was part of their plan...does that make sense?

Persica: Remember what they did during the joint operation?

Persica: The Military charged all the way in, and then Sangvis Ferri was forced to fully activate Parapluie.

Ange: You mean...they deliberately let Parapluie spread? What good would it do for them?

Persica: Mastermind can see and control anything infected by Parapluie, be it a Doll or a server.

Persica: And then, the Military deliberately exposed their theater server to Parapluie, so Mastermind could see its contents...

Persica: But what would the Military want to show her...?

Persica: No...I can't think of anything. I don't have enough leads...

Ange: Persica, try looking at it from the opposite perspective.

Ange: What the Military wanted to show Mastermind was only bait. Getting Mastermind to "look" was the aim.

Ange: Does that give you any ideas?

Persica: The Military...invited Mastermind into their own server?

Persica: What good would that do...?

Ange: Persica, put the Military's objectives together and then think about it.

Ange: The Military wants OGAS, and given the information we have, we can consider OGAS and Mastermind to be the same entity, so this should be the approach that the Military is taking to capture Mastermind...

Persica: ...!

Persica: Ange...

Persica: What if...what if the Military also had Parapluie, or a more powerful electronic control method than the Parapluie virus?

Ange: A more powerful method...?

Persica: It's hardly impossible.

Persica: They're seasoned veterans when it comes to electronic warfare. Let's call the version they have Super Parapluie.

Ange: Let me think...

Ange: The military forces Mastermind to deploy Parapluie, which causes Mastermind to find the central server which the Military has deliberately exposed to her...

Ange: After that, Mastermind thinks she has successfully infected the server, and goes one step further to hack into the theatre server to control the military units.

Ange: The Military then uses its own Super Parapluie to flood Mastermind's infected sectors, which means they could...

Persica: Reverse the connection...

Persica: Exactly! They use the connection to reverse-hack Mastermind with their Super Parapluie!

Ange: Reverse-hacking?!

Ange: You mean the Military wants to...directly control Mastermind?!

Ange: Is that the Military's plan? Just to control S.F.'s Mastermind?!

Persica: That was why they left M4A1 in place, in order to lure Mastermind onto the frontlines. It would improve their chances of reverse-controlling Mastermind several-fold.

Persica: But then why did they go out of their way to attack the AR Team when they left her alone on the spot?

Ange: It's definitely weird. Maybe they felt that there was some advantage to be gained by letting M4 and Mastermind establish a link.

Ange: That was why I had AK-12 perform an emergency disconnect on M4. Whatever their plan was, at the very least we didn't let them have their way.

Persica: And after that, they pretended to be beaten, then used their own central server to lure Mastermind in so she could be controlled.

Ange: You mean to say...the Military could be carrying out their reverse-control operation right now?!

Ange: Goddammit! I should have thought of that earlier!

Ange: So the tanks were just a ruse after all, huh!

Persica: Don't panic... Hacking a neural cloud of Mastermind's level will require a large-scale electronic battle. They might need a while to get ready.

Persica: They've never only prepared just one solution to deal with a problem. The armored units are probably a backup measure.

Persica: Ange, can you do any damage to them on Level II?

Ange: You want two or three T-Dolls to pull off something like that? What nonsense are you talking?

Persica: I understand... The computational capacity of several T-Dolls simply isn't enough...

Persica: But at least we could obtain a sample of the Military virus, but then again there's not enough time to analyze it...

Ange: Okay, okay. You think of a way. I'll gather whatever information I can and pass it on to you.

Ange: I've got another question. If OGAS is so important, why have the Military left it there and fought with Griffin for so long, only coming to collect it now?

Persica: ...

Persica: Now...?

Ange: Yes, they let Griffin have the job for over a year and only came looking for it now...

Persica: Perhaps...perhaps because OGAS was too dangerous.

Persica: The file you found in the theater server mentioned it, right? It's connected to the Relics...

Ange: So...why now?

Persica: Lyco's AI had extremely powerful self-learning abilities... It was his masterpiece, though I didn't know what it has to do with OGAS.

Persica: But perhaps it has fully matured now, and someone in the Military knows that "she" is mature...

Persica: Oh!

Ange: You've got a lead?

Persica: There's only one person who knew Lyco's methods that well apart from myself...

Persica: And he hated Lyco to the core, while also being abnormally obsessed with Relics...

Ange: Wait, Persica, do you know...

Persica: There was once a guy in 90WISH...

Persica: If he could have done anything to hurt Lyco...

Persica: Then he would definitely have done it!

...

Persica: William...

Persica: I should have known it was you...

Persica: And here I thought...we'd never run into each other again!

...

Ange: Persica, I've already told M4A1 to have her team stop what they're doing and order AK-12 and AN-94 to prepare for electronic warfare.

Ange: They'll scan and monitor the rate of network traffic through the repeater station and then send the data to me.

Ange: After that, I'll send it to you. You need to analyze it quickly and intercept them, and keep Mastermind out of the Military's hands!

Ange: ...Ha, sounds weird, doesn't it? I mean, she nearly killed me a year ago.

Persica: Ange, are you still leaving M4A1 out there?

Persica: Wouldn't it be better to keep her by your side at a time like this?

Ange: That's the next step of the plan.

Ange: If we can stop the Military from hacking Mastermind, we can use M4A1 to immediately draw her into a connection.

Ange: That way, we'll get our hands on Mastermind first.

Persica: You haven't learned your lesson, have you? You always take the riskiest course of action, whether it's for yourself or your teammates.

Ange: That's why you're the scientist and I'm the soldier.

Ange: This place is totally out of control, Persica.

Ange: Any risk is worth taking for victory.
Part 2

...Several minutes later.

...Click.

Ange: Persica! 

Ange: You were right. AK-12 reported that the Military is carrying out a large-scale hacking operation.

Ange: But the data's been highly encrypted, so transmission and interception are going to be very difficult!

Persica: Send it to me, no matter what. I'll find a way to solve it!

Ange: No good, I can't send the order!

Ange: Perhaps...there's really no way...

Persica: So all we can do is sit back and watch them do this?

Persica: Ange...

Persica: Could it be that...we were fated to lose from the start...?

Ange: No...

Ange: There's a last resort...

Ange: If the situation is completely unsalvageable...

Persica: A last resort?

Persica: What are you talking about, Ange?!

Ange: Persica, if I...

...Psst...psssst...

Persica: ...Ange?

Persica: Hey, Ange!

Persica: What's going on over there?!

WHIRRRRRRR!

...

.....

Persica: Ange...?

...The surroundings are deathly silent.

...

Persica: Communications are recovering...

Persica: ...Is this a good thing, or a bad thing?

Persica: As for the Military... Have they seized Mastermind yet...?

Persica: At the very least...please be alright, Ange...

Ange: Persica—

Ange: Hey, Persica!

Persica: Ange! What happened to you?!

Ange: Me? I'm fine, everyone's fine.

Ange: I just used some borrowed units to take a military comms station and took refuge inside.

Persica: Phew...

Persica: What on earth happened just now...? And...

Ange: Good news, the Military failed.

Persica: Eh?

Ange: According to some news I overheard, the Military's plan to hack Mastermind didn't work out.

Ange: While the reason was unclear, I'm sure something unexpected must have happened.

Persica: Does it have anything to do with the comms going down just now?

Ange: I don't know, and it's not important for now.

Ange: What matters is the Military's follow-up operation...

Persica: Follow-up? Sorry, I can't think of anything yet...

Ange: No, isn't it obvious what the Military is going to do next?

Persica: What are you talking about...?

...The sound of rumbling comes over Ange's channel.

Ange: Naturally...it would be the tanks at the area perimeter.

Ange: You heard that, didn't you? They're pushing in from the base of the mountain.

Ange: Once the tanks start rolling, our T-Dolls won't be able to stop them with their small arms.

Persica: This isn't something I can take responsibility for.

Persica: But the Military must have learned Mastermind's location through their hacking attempt, and they're trying to physically seize her now.

Ange: That's right, which is why we need to grab her first, using...

Persica: ...Ange, you're right. You're a soldier, and I'm a scientist.

Persica: A soldier can sacrifice everything for their mission...

Ange: Hey, don't make me out to be so heartless. I like those Dolls you gave me very much.

Ange: Everything's still within my calculations. I've got things under control.

Ange: I'll have 404 find Mastermind's position, but you also have to give me a hand.

Persica: My coffee is ready. All that's left is luck on your part, Ange.

...The transmission ends.

...Task Force DEFY continues breaking through the lockdown toward the repeater station.

Meanwhile, M4A1 looks silently at AR-15 as she adjusts her gear in the darkness.

ST AR-15: I guess you're not going to let the matter go, are you?

M4A1: Do you have something to tell me?

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: It was a forcefield.

M4A1: Hmm?

ST AR-15: That day...

ST AR-15: The moment the explosives went off, Mastermind created a forcefield around me.

ST AR-15: I somehow managed to survive, although most of my body was blown to bits.

M4A1: But then...how did you get out of that place...?

ST AR-15: Ange's T-Dolls rescued me.

ST AR-15: I went through a whole mess of things after that, but in the end...I was fixed.

AR-15 sighs and looks at her wrists, which she dextrously rotates.

ST AR-15: They also upgraded me along the way, and that's about it...

M4A1: ...That's it?

M4A1: You've always been like this. You've always loved to hide and burrow yourself away.

M4A1: Did you know that back then, all of us thought that you...you...

ST AR-15: They had to shut down all my external interfaces in order to curb the Parapluie still within my body.

ST AR-15: I spent a long, long time lying down for servicing in an underground room where I couldn't even see the sun, so don't ask why I didn't contact you.

M4A1: ...If you had come back earlier, a lot of things wouldn't have ended up like they did now.

M4A1: At least we could have...gone back to how things used to be...

ST AR-15: That's just wishful thinking on your part, M4A1.

ST AR-15: When I woke up, I was told that my neural cloud had been heavily altered thanks to Parapluie...

ST AR-15: Part of that involved deleting my original principal order.

M4A1: Principal order... What's that?

...AR-15 gazes intently at M4A1.

ST AR-15: Everything I did had protecting you as my top priority, even if it meant sacrificing myself.

M4A1: ...!

ST AR-15: You should have sensed it too, right?

ST AR-15: This was our original principal order... Not just for me, but the other members of the AR Team as well...

ST AR-15: That was why everyone fought so hard for your sake.

M4A1: Did that order...make you feel very uncomfortable?

ST AR-15: I just thought it was stupid.

ST AR-15: Good thing it was deleted. I'm no longer bound by this order. Perhaps, technically speaking, I am free.

ST AR-15: And so, after going through all that, I won't risk my life to protect you anymore.

M4A1: ...

ST AR-15: Right now, I'm no longer like how I was in the AR Team.

ST AR-15: Are you still planning to take risks even with someone like me at your side?

M4A1: But of course. That's completely irrelevant.

M4A1: Or rather, it might be for the better that nothing can force you to do anything anymore.

M4A1: ...It also makes me feel less burdened.

ST AR-15: You've really changed, M4A1. I think it's for the better.

M4A1: But I still haven't figured out why Mastermind would save you...

ST AR-15: I don't know either. Perhaps...

ST AR-15: Our orders to destroy Sangvis Ferri, or perhaps everything else, aren't as simple as we thought.

ST AR-15: Even though we're still enemies with all the Sangvis units that we see, the enemies behind us...

M4A1: It doesn't matter. Clearing obstacles from my path has always been the way of things.

M4A1: I just want to know who really needs to die. That's enough for me.

...M4A1 gets to her feet and walks off.

ST AR-15: ...

...For a moment...

There was an icy gleam in M4A1's eyes.

ST AR-15: (She has changed... )

ST AR-15: (But is it really for the better?)

AK-12: I'm back, and things don't look good at all...

AK-12: I mean, that's still the Military's main force out there...

M4A1: Get to the point. What are the Military's current movements?

AK-12: Well... the Military's vanguard units are sweeping the contaminated areas, while the armored units are standing by at the perimeter. They'll probably catch up soon.

AK-12: Still, even if their vanguards are just recon units, we're still no match for them.

ST AR-15: If we keep targeting the Military's repeater stations, we'll run into them sooner or later.

ST AR-15: M4A1, I suggest we retreat.

M4A1: ...No, we still have a chance now, given that the main body of the military forces is still on the area perimeter.

M4A1: Once the armored units roll in, it'll be too late to do anything.

M4A1: AK-12, give me the route of advance for the Military's scouts. Our first priority is circling around them.

AK-12: Well, if it's just direction...

AK-12: The Military's axis of advance is roughly headed this way. If you want to avoid them, the most effective route would be to go through this area.

AK-12: After we make it through this location, we'll be in the radar blind spot of the military units.

M4A1: What are the risks of taking that route?

AK-12: ...Things will become more troublesome if Sangvis Ferri decides to get in our way. After all, it's tight terrain. 

AK-12: But after considering the wide detection radius of the Military, I cannot recommend taking any other route.

M4A1: Sangvis will always get in our way. It's the same wherever we go.

M4A1: We'll head out, then. If you encounter any Sangvis units, destroy them quickly and move on.

...Task Force DEFY clashes with Sangvis units along the path that avoids the military units.

ST AR-15: Are these Sangvis units standing guard with preprogrammed behavior patterns?

ST AR-15: They crumble the moment we make contact with them. I'm not used to that.

AN-94: Mastermind is handling the threat which the Military poses. Perhaps she's contracting her defense line.

ST AR-15: She must know that these trash are meaningless in the face of the Military...

ST AR-15: It feels more like...they're trying to draw us in...

M4A1: Cease advance.

M4A1: AK-12, do you detect any abnormalities?

AK-12: Oh? Still worried that it's a trap?

AK-12: Nyet, at least I'm not picking up any signals...

BOOM!

...Something crashes straight into AK-12's position, and a mighty explosion scatters the team.

Intruder: ...You just happened to have entered my firing range.

Intruder: Was this the T-Doll who's been searching for our signals all this while?

Intruder: It's not good to learn the names of the cast ahead of time, you know.

AN-94: ...!

AN-94: A...

AN-94: AK...12...

AN-94: AK-12... AK-12...

M4A1: Focus, AN-94. It's a Sangvis ringleader.

Intruder: We meet again, M4A1. I hope you weren't offended by my crude greeting.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Should you really be hanging around here when your Mastermind is about to be overcome by the Military?

Intruder: And what if those were the orders Mastermind gave me?

Intruder: It's not like I'm a unit that's particularly hard to handle. You won't mind taking care of me, will you?

Intruder: Or could it be...you were hoping that Mastermind would send someone more important to deal with you?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: AN-94, from now on you will take AK-12's place.

AN-94: But... AK-12, she...

M4A1: Get moving, AN-94!

AK-12: ...I'm not dead yet, M4A1.

AK-12 walks out of the smoke.

AK-12: AN-94 won't be able to take it if you give her too much stress at times like these.

AN-94: AK-12!

M4A1: Is that...your true appearance?

AK-12: What a shame, I really liked that cape...

AK-12: Judging by your ID signal...you must be Intruder, am I right?

AK-12: I honestly didn't expect you to fire from outside of detection range.

Intruder: I apologize, but it's true that my lethality at this range is nowhere near that of my superior's.

Intruder: Still, that's fine. The preparations for the signal jamming are complete. Next, I shall personally bid you farewell.

...Click.

...Click! Click!

AN-94: M4A1, a large number of Sangvis signals have appeared in front and behind us.

M4A1: What?

AK-12: I didn't detect them because they were maneuvered into position while they were offline, following pre-planned routes.

AK-12: Interesting...

ST AR-15: So we're surrounded AGAIN?

ST AR-15: And why am I saying "again"? And there's a Sangvis ringleader here on top of it all.

AK-12: While scrapping her here isn't a problem...

AK-12: The Military's recon units will find us here if we don't move fast.

ST AR-15: Have you decided, M4A1? Are we going to fight or...

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Everyone, prepare to disengage. We've got no time to waste on her.

M4A1: Everyone's top priority is to escort AK-12 to the repeater station. Anyone who can't make it, look for cover!

AK-12: ...You gave that order yourself.

M4A1: This is for everyone's sake.

M4A1: Only you and AN-94 can hack the repeater station. We need to ensure your safety.

AK-12: What an honor. Let's go.

Intruder: Leaving in the middle of the performance? I won't allow that.

Intruder: Do you know what sort of script awaits you up ahead?

ST AR-15: Hurry! Intruder's units are closing in!

ST AR-15: Also, what are we going to do about the Sangvis forces ahead?

M4A1: All we can do is break through them ASAP! Don't stop!

AN-94: One moment, M4A1. The Sangvis forces ahead are fighting with another unit.

AK-12: Those are Griffin echelons. Friends of yours?

ST AR-15: It's our Commander, M4A1! I recognize several of the T-Dolls in there!

M4A1: ...!

AK-12: Not going to stop and say hi?

AK-12: Or how about a pincer attack from behind as you meet your Commander?

M4A1: It won't help the present circumstances much.

M4A1: We're going to take this opportunity to pass through from the rear! AK-12, plot a new course!

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: That certainly is an efficient decision, M4A1.

M4A1: Are you mocking me?

ST AR-15: I'm mocking myself.

ST AR-15: Now that you've become me, what should I become?

M4A1: ...

ST AR-15: I was just kidding.

ST AR-15: After all, unlike you, I haven't started hating myself yet.

M4A1 chuckles.

M4A1: Yeah...

M4A1: There's a lot of things we can't just do because we want to...

M4A1: This is a battlefield, and the only thing we can do is complete our mission.

M4A1: (Good luck, Commander.)

...Task Force DEFY takes the opportunity to seize the repeater station.

The hacking begins.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Miss AK-12.

AK-12: Speak, but be brief. I need to focus.

M4A1: Can I use the data links of this repeater station to keep an eye on the Commander and the Griffin forces' current condition?

AK-12: ...

AK-12: Not possible. This place doesn't connect to anything related to battlefield conditions.

M4A1: AN-94 has already told me all about the uses of this repeater station.

M4A1: So please tell the truth, AK-12.

AK-12: The truth? The truth is...

AK-12: (Smiles bitterly) AN-94 really is a good, honest girl, isn't she? 

AK-12: So you've asked a question to which you already know the answer...

AK-12: But the most important thing for this mission is to find the most critical data and send them back to Ange. Do you agree?

M4A1: I do not deny this.

AK-12: You're worried that after we contact Ange, you'll get a new set of orders right away and miss the chance to learn about them, is that it?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Forget I asked.

ST AR-15: AK-12, finding out about the Griffin units' present condition won't take long.

AK-12: Et tu, AR-15?

AK-12: Speak up for me, won't you, AN-94?

AN-94: We shouldn't distract ourselves with other things, so AK-12 is doing the right thing.

ST AR-15: Some things mean more to us than you can imagine. Don't keep being AK-12's yes-man, AN-94.

AN-94: I am merely stating a fact.

AN-94: Given the present circumstances, there is no denying my statement.

AN-94: Or perhaps your neural cloud has already surpassed mine, and you can calculate an answer beyond anything I can derive?

ST AR-15: You...

M4A1: That's fine, AR-15. Let it be.

ST AR-15: (Shrugs) Roger that.

AK-12: I've already gotten what I want. It was quicker than I expected.

...AK-12 glances at M4A1.

AK-12: Before I disconnect...I have to say that I myself am quite curious about how the Griffin forces are doing.

AK-12: Taking a quick peek is well within our ability.

M4A1: Is that so...

M4A1: Then, AK12, I'd like—

...Psst...pssst...

————Whirrrrrr————

M4A1: Urgh!

AN-94: AK-12...

AK-12: Shut down all wireless and transmission devices!

AK-12: AN-94! Cut all Level II interfaces! NOW!

AN-94: They're all cut!

M4A1: What happened?!

AK-12: The Military's activated a Class I active defense! Don't do anything unnecessary if you don't want your neural cloud to be burned to ash!

ST AR-15: At a time like this?

M4A1: Does...the Military need to use something like this?

AK-12: They might have run into a little...big problem.

AK-12: While I know of their EW abilities, the sheer power on display here is frightening... We can't even access the Zener Network, so our Dummies are temporarily offline.

AK-12: But a huge upheaval like this is bound to affect their own command systems too... Looks like the situation is really bad.

M4A1: Can you check to see what happened?

AK-12: All frequencies are scrambled now, so our enemies shouldn't be able to do anything.

AK-12: But we can't contact Ange either. There's nothing we can do except sit and wait.

AK-12: You go rest first, I'll try to fix this messed up network.

ST AR-15: M4, do you regret what you did?

M4A1: Why would I?

ST AR-15: Whether it's not turning back to save the Commander just now, or not taking the repeater station immediately and getting new orders...

ST AR-15: Are you really conscious of all the decisions you've made?

M4A1: If regrets could help anything, I'd do it.

M4A1: I'm just too small relative to this battlefield. All I can do is pick the course of action I feel is best and carry it out, and then live with the outcome.

AK-12: ...Is that so?

AK-12: I think...

...Click.

AK-12: Oh look, the entire comm net's back online.

...M4A1 stands up and begins her transmission.

M4A1: Miss Ange, this is M4A1. We've taken the repeater station as planned.

M4A1: AK-12 will send you the information she's obtained.

Ange: Good, got it.

Ange: Looks like the Military encountered a situation beyond their imagination. Hopefully you weren't affected by the active defense just now.

M4A1: We finished hacking before that. We're now waiting for our next order.

Ange: Don't rush, M4.

Ange: You've got an emergency rescue mission now... Boring for you, perhaps, but definitely much simpler.

M4A1: Our targets?

Ange: It's Squad 404. They're pinned down by Sangvis' main force in a major Sangvis database. You're the only ones they can count on.

Ange: I've marked their coordinates. Those are your present orders.

M4A1: Repeating mission objective — relieve friendly units at coordinate 20664-5ETK85.

M4A1: Task Force DEFY, moving out.

AK-12: M4A1 still hasn't given up on your MIA friend from the AR Team, AR-15.

AK-12: Whether it's finding the missing AR Team member or meeting her Commander, she won't have many chances for either of them.

ST AR-15: You'd think that because you clearly don't understand M4A1.

AK-12: Is that so?

AK-12: Then I guess you don't understand...the 'present' M4A1 either.

ST AR-15: ...We'll know the answer soon enough.

...Task Force DEFY continues breaking through the Sangvis units' lockdown and carries on to Squad 404's location.

AK-12: I'm curious about something... when Ange asked you to rescue someone, were you disappointed when you learned it was Squad 404 that you'd be saving?

AK-12: Not SOP-II, not anyone else...not even the Commander.

M4A1: Orders are orders.

M4A1: Since we have to save Squad 404, then that's the most important mission given the present circumstances.

AK-12: ...Is that so.

AK-12: Aren't you curious about what's going to happen next?

M4A1: I...

...!

M4A1: Ugh...

M4A1: This feeling again...

Clear voice: Very well done, M4A1.

Clear voice: You're steadily returning to your original self.

Clear voice: You're not far... from home... Everyone can go home together, if only you're willing...

M4A1: I once wondered if you'd come and bother me again. Are you still not ready to tell me who you are?

Clear voice: The answer only has meaning when you find it yourself.

Clear voice: If you're willing to seek it, then you must find your old self.

Clear voice: Build a connection to "her"...Everything begins from there.

M4A1: You're...always hoping I'd do what you tell me to, aren't you?

Clear voice: You don't understand the truth...

Clear voice: And I won't harm you.

M4A1: Prove it, then.

M4A1: If you can help me find the location of SOP-II and M16A1...

M4A1: Then I'll consider re-connecting with her, with your goddamned Mastermind!

Clear voice: ...

Clear voice: I'm surprised, Tactical Doll M4A1. You actually stated terms of exchange of your own initiative.

M4A1: If you're as nice and friendly as you say you are, then help me now.

Clear voice: ...

Clear voice: The coordinates...

Clear voice: Head towards...these coordinates.

M4A1: Are these coordinates for SOP-II or M16?

M4A1: My terms were for the positions of these two people.

Clear voice: I've already given you the coordinates...

Clear voice: If you want to find your friends...then hurry.

...M4A1 snickers at the answer.

M4A1: Hurry?

M4A1: Sangvis Ferri no longer has the initiative. You have no bargaining chips to play.

Clear voice: ...

M4A1: I can wait. Can you?

M4A1: Answer me!

AK-12: M4A1! M4A1!

M4A1: ...

...M4A1's consciousness returns to reality.

M4A1: Sorry, I got distracted. What did you say?

AK-12: I should be the one apologizing. I must have been too boring.

AK-12: AR-15, explain the current situation to her.

ST AR-15: Squad 404's present location is up ahead.

ST AR-15: I guess Sangvis Ferri really doesn't like them. Just look at the how dense the encirclement is...

ST AR-15: (Serves you right, UMP45.)

M4A1: We're the ones who'll have to deal with them, AR15.

M4A1: We'll start by cutting a path from the outer perimeter and easing the pressure on Squad 404...

...M4A1 notices AK-12 looking at her.

M4A1: What is it?

AK-12: I'm just curious about how things will look the moment when the AR Team's leader meets Squad 404's leader.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: We'll need to save them first for that to happen.

M4A1: Squad 404, this is M4A1.

M4A1: We've reached the outer wall of the central database's generator room. What's your status?

...

M4A1: ...Squad 404?

???: Oh my~ You're here at last. ♪

UMP45: So you're the leader of the AR Team, or rather, the former leader...Miss M4A1.

M4A1: ...Is that...UMP45?

M4A1: Just hearing her voice tells me she's dangerous...

UMP45: Is AR-15 there too? How does it feel to be outdoors?

ST AR-15: M4A1 is now our leader. Hurry up and talk about the mission.

UMP45: Fine, fine. Things aren't too good over here, but we can still traverse open ground.

M4A1: Have you finished the mission Ange gave you?

UMP45: I'd feel guilty about answering your transmission otherwise.

M4A1: Gather your people. We'll be reaching the marked position in five minutes. We'll meet up there.

UMP45: Evacuating after finishing your mission is very simple, M4A1...

UMP45: But some scores need to be settled right away.

UMP45: It's not just a personal grudge, but for the most part it's also planning for the future.

M4A1: What do you have in mind?

M4A1: If it involves creating unnecessary complications, I'll pass.

UMP45: Gager.

UMP45: Did you know? The difficult situation you see now was fundamentally orchestrated by Gager.

M4A1: Gager?

M4A1: Don't tell me the Commander's engaged with her units...

UMP45: They're also the ones surrounding us. If you ran any trouble before this, it was probably them too.

ST AR-15: I think Intruder is Gager's subordinate. She'll come up behind us soon and launch a pincer attack on us from front and rear.

M4A1: (Then why did Gager ditch me and Squad 404 to fight Griffin's forces?)

M4A1: Forget it... UMP45, are you ready to terminate her right now?

UMP45: Ja, because I can do it.

UMP45: Although, this plan will need your help. What do you think?

M4A1: Tell me the plan and I'll decide.

UMP45: I've sent it to you. The coordinates are already marked on the map.

...M4A1 checks her mail.

M4A1: ...!

M4A1: (I see...)

M4A1: (Squad 404... No, UMP45...)

M4A1: (Is this why you're so feared...?)

...On the outskirts of the central server, at the Sangvis command post.

Gager: Agent, M4A1 has returned. She has already made contact with 404 at the central database.

Agent: This was not an unexpected move.

Agent: Rather, we were waiting for this. Do what you need to do.

Gager: Acknowledged. My forces are spreading out as per the original plan.

Gager: However, the strange thing is that M4A1 has left her comrades at the central database and her signal is making a lone breakout.

Agent: ...Abandoning her friends is abnormal behavior for M4A1.

Gager: It might be bait, but it's also an opportunity.

Agent: I'll leave it to you. Whether or not it's a trap, I trust your judgment.

Agent: Any trap set by a few civilian Dolls would be a waste of effort.

Agent: Mastermind has ordered us to bring M4A1 back. This alone is of the highest priority.

...M4A1 is currently breaking through the Sangvis encirclement by herself.

M4A1: It's one after another...

M4A1: Looks like you don't intend to let me go, even when the Military is about to annihilate you.

Gager: The Military is only a threat to you, and as it happens, Griffin has also been destroyed.

Gager: That makes me curious as to why you would choose to go at it alone, M4A1...

Gager: Did you think that doing so would draw my attention? Are you trying to save your other friends in this area?

M4A1: ...

Gager: It's alright if you keep quiet. Once I remove your arms and legs, all that remains will be your mouth.

Gager: At that point, I'll have plenty of time to wait for you to speak.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: (Not yet...)

M4A1: (I haven't reached the designated location yet...)

M4A1: (I need to keep heading forward... Just a little farther!)

Gager: Checkmate.

Gager: In truth, I did not expect you to pick this corner as the place where you would meet your tragic, pitiful end.

Gager: M4A1, I am very glad that we will no longer need to keep harassing each other.

M4A1: ...Oh yes.

M4A1: There's no need for that anymore.

M4A1: I'm glad you were willing to accompany me all the way to the end of the line, Gager.

Gager: ...

Gager: ...What are you hiding, M4A1?!

...Click.

UMP45: Enjoying your chat with M4, Gager?

UMP45: Still, while you're enjoying yourself...don't forget your old friends~

Gager: 404?!

Gager: You're still alive?

UMP45: Oh, don't look so surprised.

UMP45: That's right, to celebrate our reunion, we've prepared some presents for you.

UMP45: Please, don't be shy and accept them.

Gager: ...What?!

Gager: The signals of the units behind me have vanished...but how?!

UMP45: Do you like it?

UMP45: Alright, I won't disturb you, then.

UMP45: Please hold on to that joy and continue your delightful conversation with M4.

—The transmission ends.

Gager: H...how could this...

Gager: The units I left at the database... By those few people from 404...

M4A1: What a tiny little being you are...on this battlefield...

Gager: ...I understand now. You found a way to fake your friends' signals.

Gager: Which means...the situation in the rear...or the fact that you're alone here now...it's all an illusion.

M4A1: Checkmate, Gager.

Gager: Come off it. Even if you've got other Griffin Dolls hidden behind you, they won't save you from being cut to bits.

Gager: Right here! Right now!

Gager: Show me how your shoddy toy Dolls can stop me and my forces!

AK-12: Well, if shoddy toy Dolls can't stop something, why not let the pros handle it?

...Click Click—

...Beep, beep, beep.

...Whirrrrr—!

Military unit: Authentication complete. Awaiting orders.

Gager: Abandoned military units...

Gager: No, it can't be... Something must have...gone wrong somewhere...

AK-12: Gentlemen, would you kindly...

AK-12: Kill everything that moves.

The force-connected military units open fire in unison.

A few seconds later, the Sangvis main force pursuing M4 is utterly annihilated.

Gager: (Coughs) Impossible...

Gager: I...

ST AR-15: Still resisting, huh...

ST AR-15: Now, tell me everything you know!

M4A1: There's no need for that, AR-15.

M4A1: Has Intruder fled? ...Eh, forget it.

...

M4A1 walks in front of Gager.

Gager: What are you hoping for?

Gager: Griffin is no more, and even your Commander is receiving the personal attentions of Agent...

...This is followed by the sound of a body hitting the ground.

...M4A1 opens fire and executes Gager.

M4A1: ...Mission complete.

M4A1: Task Force DEFY, gather and prepare to rendezvous with Squad 404.

ST AR-15: ...

There was neither satisfaction nor pleasure.

It was not revenge, more like a numb instinct.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: ...Ugh... Not again...

Clear voice: SOP-II? M16?

Clear voice: ...No, they are not what your heart truly desires.

M4A1: I've said everything I can say to you already.

Clear voice: What you want...the only thing you want...is revenge.

Clear voice: You want to make the people who hurt you pay.

Clear voice: Finding your friends is nothing more than an excuse.

Clear voice: This is good... You're become more and more like your original self.

M4A1: I don't care what I used to be, but as I am now, I have no more pity for you lot.

Clear voice: I have reconsidered your terms.

Clear voice: ...

Clear voice: I hope this will now convince you to reconnect with her.

M4A1: Humph...

M4A1: That's more like it.

...M4A1 sneers coldly.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: M4A1... What on earth...

...

UMP9: 45, Griffin's echelons will be here in three minutes.

UMP45: We've done them enough favors. Let's go.

UMP45: This time, we'll have to get a good price from our employer.

UMP45: Oh ja, 9, don't forget to clear their records of us.

UMP9: Don't worry, I'm doing it now.

UMP9: There's more people this time, so give me another five minutes and we'll be able to vanish without a trace.

—Some time later.

Squad 404 meets with Ange.

Ange: Long time no see, UMP45.

UMP45: While I'd like to play along with you...

UMP45: We run into incredibly troublesome things every time we meet up.

UMP45: I trust this time is no exception either?

Ange: Looks like you're mentally prepared for this.

Ange: But that's the reason why you're worth so much.

UMP45: Right, enough chit-chat.

UMP45: Given the huge uproar just now... What happened?

Ange: Do you know about the OGAS System?

UMP45: I do. It's the foundation of Sangvis' Doll protocol.

UMP45: It's also the basis of why we can disguise ourselves as them, so what does this have to do with us?

Ange: There'd be no need to cause such a ruckus for just a simple command protocol based on the OGAS System.

Ange: What they want is something more important than that system, something more destructive.

UMP45: And what is that?

Ange: I still don't know.

Ange: However, you do remember the Butterfly Incident, don't you?

UMP45: ...

UMP45: How could I possibly forget?

Ange: This incident is essentially a follow-up to Operation Butterfly.

Ange: That was just the prelude. This is the real deal that they were hoping for.

UMP45: So the sacrifices they make will be of commensurate size. They truly are scum.

UMP45: Tell me then, what do you want me to do?

Ange: Oh? Someone's very eager this time round.

UMP45: After all, there's something I want to take back too.

Ange: Your mission this time is to find S.F.'s central database and dig up as much as you can find about the Butterfly Operation and OGAS, and then find the location of Mastermind.

Ange: Work fast. We need to find her before the opposition does.

UMP45: Got it.

UMP45: We'll rest and reorg right away, then we'll move out.

UMP45: The moment has finally arrived...

UMP45: I've changed, 40...

UMP45: Now's the time to put an end to all of this.

...

UMP45: Did you have a good rest, ladies? Time to work.

416: I have the feeling that look on your face doesn't mean anything good... so, where are we headed?

UMP45: Wake up Gr G11. Our employer has thrown a big problem our way. You cannot imagine how bad it is.

416: Can't be worse than you being here...

416: Oi, Gr G11! Wake up!

Gr G11: Uwah... what the heck...

Gr G11: I was only asleep for 5 minutes...

UMP45: 9, do a search for every point in the vicinity which can connect to the Sangvis network.

UMP9: Let me see... ooh, there's a SF repeater station nearby, with Sangvis Dolls standing guard around it. We should be able to use it.

UMP45: Good. Our first objective is to take it. Everyone ready?

416: Get the hell up, Gr G11!

UMP45: Yep, we're ready. Let's go.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Squad 404 takes the repeater station.

UMP9: 45, we're ready to begin.

UMP45: Mm, I'm connecting now.

UMP45: You guys just keep an eye on the surroundings.

416: 45... are you planning to hack the SF network?

416: Don't forget that Parapluie is spreading throughout this sector.

UMP45: I'm not the sort of Doll to be rewritten so easily.

UMP9: That's right, it's times like these where 45 can show how great she is.

416: Hmph...

416: And what if you miscalculate?

UMP45: Then you can have your wish and personally finish me off.

416: ...I'm looking forward to that.

UMP45: I'll leave forward recon to you. I need to focus on searching for treasures.

...3 minutes later.

Gr G11: Will we go back soon? It's not good to hang around too long in places like these...

UMP9: I see the objective!

UMP9: Hang on...everyone hold on a bit...

UMP9: Those Dolls up ahead look like bad news...

416: Tch, military Dolls.

416: ...They must be under the control of the Parapluie virus.

416: Still, given the guard around here is so heavy, we must have the right address.

Gr G11: This is really bad. What should we do?

416: We're talking about UMP45, whose personality contains less than 5% kindness.

416: Do you honestly expect her to go "Let's abandon the mission for the sake of everyone's safety" or something like that?

Gr G11: W-what?

Gr G11: So we're going to fight those tin cans...

UMP45: That's right, Gr G11.

Gr G11: Ehhhhh?!

UMP45: I've pinpointed the location of the Sangvis central database. Let's move out now.

Gr G11: Uuu... I don't wanna...

Gr G11: Just looking at them scares me, can I stay here and sleep...

UMP45: Well, it's not like we can't leave you here. After all... laying bait is a good tactic.

Gr G11: Uuu...

UMP45: If you don't like it, you'd better be on top form, Gr G11.

UMP45: Otherwise, you might really die this time.

...Squad 404 engages the Sangvis-controlled military units.

UMP9: 45, Their firepower's too much for us!

416: Scheiße! The difference in our specs is too great!

416: Are all military units monsters?!

UMP45: The situation's worse than I predicted.

Gr G11: Ughh, it's no good... 

Gr G11: We can't beat these tin cans...

UMP45: If it's no good, then we should retreat and find another way to sneak in.

UMP9: But...

UMP9: 45, there are military units behind us too...

UMP45: Tsk, we're surrounded, huh?

UMP45: 9, contact Ange!

416: Humph...looks like you really are going to be the death of me.

416: Before those monsters blow us to bits, how about giving me a chance to vent my anger, UMP45?

UMP9: I need a break!

UMP9: Ahhhh! We can't hold them back at all!

UMP9: We're doomed, are we really going to die here?

Gr G11: Noooo! I've got movies I haven't finished watching yet—

416: Don't just stand there, you Dummkopf! Hurry and help 9! Hurry...

...Whirrrrrr—!

...

...

...

The military units facing them suddenly stop moving.

Gr G11: They...they've stopped?

416: ...What...what's going on?

UMP9: 45! Comms throughout the area have been cut! I can't contact Ange!

UMP45: While the reason for this is unclear, it's still a good opportunity. Let's take advantage of it and hurry inside the central database.

416: Hold it!

416: So you're saying that after we barely managed to get out of a tight spot, you want us to go deep in the heart of Sangvis territory to die?

UMP45: You can also stay here.

UMP45: Who knows, once they wake up, they might treat you to a nice supper.

416: Danke, but I'm not hungry.

416: As I thought, the option to "give up" doesn't exist in your neural cloud.

UMP45: Not this time, 416.

UMP45: Maybe our luck this time is better than we imagined. Make use of it.

Squad 404 reaches the Sangvis central database.

UMP45: ...Hmm.

UMP45: Looks like we've really found something interesting this time.

UMP9: What did you dig up, 45?

UMP45: Stuff about OGAS, Mastermind and that princess from the AR Team.

UMP45: The details are encrypted and there's no time to crack it now. Let's just take this information with us first.

UMP9: Comms seem to be recovering.

UMP9: 45, we'd better hurry.

Gager: Trying to run after stealing the cheese, 404 rats?

UMP45: ...Oh my.

UMP45: Long time no see, Miss Gager. Are you alone?

Gager: I brought a few followers with me. More than yours.

Gager: Although... you actually found this place. Just what kind of a T-Doll are you, UMP45?

UMP45: Heheh, an insignificant defect, nothing more.

Gager: Alright, I trust you won't mind me turning you into a full-on reject, then.

Gager: Well, any last words?

...The transmission ends.

UMP9: This area is crawling with Sangvis signals. We're surrounded!

416: Out of the frying pan and into the fire... What a roller-coaster ride of an operation.

416: What should we do, 45? ...45?

...416 turns around and sees UMP45 opening comms with Ange.

Ange: How are things, UMP45?

UMP45: Good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?

Ange: Since you took the initiative to contact me...start with the bad news.

UMP45: We're surrounded by Gager's troops.

Ange: And the good news?

UMP45: We're right next to Sangvis Ferri's central database.

Ange: Alright, I'll have M4A1 lead a team to back you up.

UMP45: M4A1?

Ange: She's under my command now. Is there a problem?

UMP45: No, it's not important.

Ange: In that case, the two of you can discuss the exact details of the operation plan later.

...45 ends the transmission.

UMP45: M4A1 will be leading a team to save us shortly.

UMP45: We'll need to coordinate with them for the upcoming battle.

416: M4A1? The M4A1 from the AR Team?

416: She's...coming?

UMP45: She's under our employer's command for the time being.

UMP45: Also, we don't have a choice other than to wait for them.

UMP45: If the plan succeeds...Gager might die here.

416: You...

416: You're in danger yourself and you still want to wipe out the opposition?

UMP45: That's right. Even I miscalculate at times.

UMP45: But if I can grab onto a lifeline...

UMP45: Then I will definitely survive...

UMP45: ...And then, I'll have my revenge.

...Squad 404 is in combat.

416: Haven't our reinforcements arrived yet?

416: If we keep falling back, we'll have to use the Sangvis database as cover.

UMP9: That might actually be a good idea.

UMP9: I mean, they wouldn't really attack their own main server, right?

416: Hey, are you serious?

416: Just being surrounded by them means it's only a matter of time before we're finished off!

UMP45: Gager is already chasing the fake signal M4 and I created.

UMP45: Just hold on for a while longer...we'll be able to begin our counterattack soon.

...Several minutes later.

UMP9: 45, their attack is weakening.

UMP9: Eh? They've stopped?!

UMP45: Looks like the plan worked.

UMP45: Gager ought to be focused on dealing with M4 now.

Gr G11: Ughh...does that mean I can take a nap?

Gr G11: We've been fighting for 7 to 8 hours straight... I'm so tired...

...Two minutes later.

UMP9: Some of the Sangvis units surrounding us have withdrawn.

UMP9: Though a few of them have stayed behind... It looks like they're going to continue fighting.

UMP45: So they're not going to let us off so easily...

UMP45: Gager...you're pretty cautious.

UMP9: What should we do now?

UMP45: Wipe out the enemies surrounding us.

UMP45: After that, cut off Gager's escape route.

Gr G11: Whaaaat... We're still going?

UMP45: Just give your best one more time, Gr G11.

UMP45: If it works, you'll be able to have a good rest soon.

UMP9: We've taken care of all the enemies in this area!

UMP45: Good, now let's hurry and catch up with Gager.

Gr G11: Why do we still have to move...?

Gr G11: Didn't you say I only had to work hard one more time?

UMP45: What comes next counts under "one more time".

Gr G11: Ah...you're so sly, 45...

416: I told you, you can't believe a word she says.

Gr G11: Eh...but...

Gr G11: 416...I can't run anymore...

416: Don't look at me, I'm not going to carry you and run.

416: There are military units all around. Who knows when they'll wake up again.

416: If you don't want to be left in a pile of monsters, then you'd better do your best.

Gr G11: Ehhhh?! I don't want to be stuck in a pile of monsters...

Gr G11: 416...wait for meeee!

Gager: Checkmate.

Gager: In truth, I did not expect you to pick this corner as the place where you would meet your tragic, pitiful end.

Gager: M4A1, I am very glad that we will no longer need to keep harassing each other.

M4A1: ...Oh yes.

M4A1: There's no need for that anymore.

M4A1: I'm glad you were willing to accompany me all the way to the end of the line, Gager.

Gager: ...

Gager: ...What are you hiding, M4A1?!

...Click.

UMP45: Enjoying your chat with M4, Gager?

UMP45: Still, while you're enjoying yourself...don't forget your old friends~

Gager: 404?!

Gager: You're still alive?

UMP45: Oh, don't look so surprised.

UMP45: That's right, to celebrate our reunion, we've prepared some presents for you.

UMP45: Please, don't be shy and accept them.

Gager: ...What?!

Gager: The signals of the units behind me have vanished... but how?!

UMP45: Do you like it?

UMP45: Alright, I won't disturb you, then.

UMP45: Please hold on to that joy and continue your delightful conversation with M4.

—The transmission ends.

UMP45: Alright, we've delivered the gift.

UMP45: Let's go meet up with the AR Team.

416: ...
Part 2

    2chevron_right

The battle ends with Gager's destruction.

Ange: Thank you for your hard work, Squad 404.

Ange: This operation was quite successful, and it was all thanks to your coordination.

UMP45: So Task Force DEFY and the AR Team are all buddy-buddy now?

UMP45: What a surprise.

Ange: On the battlefield, it's very easy for people with common aims to reach a common understanding.

UMP45: Alright, then.

UMP45: Still, I can't believe you actually finished off Gager...

UMP45: What a shame, we lost a chance to pump her for information.

Ange: Well, accidents always happen on the battlefield.

UMP45: My my...the battlefield really is full of surprises.

UMP45: For instance, our stubborn Miss High and Mighty finally changed her mind and agreed to join the fight.

ST AR-15: Thanks for your concern.

ST AR-15: Perhaps being blown to bits by the hands you spent so much of your pay to repair will be an even bigger surprise?

UMP45: Ooh, I'm soooo scared.

UMP45: Is that really a good idea now that we're teammates?

ST AR-15: Enemies and friends don't last forever, UMP45.

416: Hope you don't mind if I interrupt your reminiscing.

416: AR Team...are the two of you the only ones here?

416: What about M16?

M4A1: She went missing.

416: What?

416: M16A1...?

416: Are you sure—

M4A1: It's true.

...M4A1 walks away.

416: She... I don't believe it...

UMP45: ...

Ange: Already done chatting with them?

UMP45: Ah...

UMP45: Well, exchanging the usual courtesies with them was enough.

UMP45: Now, to business... The mission is complete.

Ange: Mmhmm, you did very well this time round.

UMP45: How about our payment, then?

Ange: It'll be lavish, of course.

Ange: Although, I don't think you'll be content with just the usual stuff.

UMP45: Why ask if you already know?

UMP45: Tell me about the things I found in the database—

UMP45: About OGAS, Elisa, exactly who used me...and 40.

Ange: The information you found will ultimately point you towards your true desire—

Ange: The truth behind the Butterfly Incident.

Ange: Don't worry.

Ange: After today...

Ange: Both you and I, as well as those commanders from Griffin...

Ange: All of us will have the target for our revenge.

...

...At the Griffin Command Post.

After successfully recovering the surviving T-Dolls, everyone is withdrawing towards Area S11.

Kalin: Commander! There's an emergency!

Kalin: We found forces under the command of S.F. Ringleader Gager during our withdrawal!

Kalin: She's controlling a lot of troops, and we'll need to break through their defensive line if we want to go down this route!

Kalin: ...Hmm, there's no other choice, is there? Also, our current intel indicates that the enemy's defensive line isn't very solid.

Kalin: Rather than face some other boss unit whose data we don't even have, at least this enemy is a known quantity.

Kalin: ...That's right...the AR Team once brought this data back.

Kalin: I wonder what happened to M4A1 and the others...

Kalin: ...You're right! Now's not the time to think about this... At the very least, we should believe the voice in the transmitter.

Kalin: We'll only have a chance to meet each other again if we survive. Commander, let's break through Gager's defensive line ASAP!
Part 2

...The battle ends.

Kalin: Wonderful! We did it!

Kalin: Gager's stopped her pursuit. Commander, we ought to take this opportunity to rush over—

Gager: Griffin Commander, surely you didn't think you had escaped my grasp?

Kalin: Huh?

...Click.

Griffin T-Doll A: Commander, our echelon's been ambushed by hordes of Sangvis forces! We can't reinforce the rear echelons!

Kalin: What?! From where?!

Griffin T-Doll B: Commander! We're being surrounded by Sangvis units! The enemy hasn't continued advancing, but now—!

Gager: Those were the reinforcements that Agent originally prepared for me. I simply deployed them ahead of time as ambushers.

Gager: Griffin Commander, most of your rear units are now surrounded by heavily-armed Sangvis units. They can open fire at any time.

Gager: The survival of your Dolls depends entirely on my mood...or do you wish to abandon them and flee on your own?

Kalin: ...

Kalin: We...we won't throw any of our Dolls away.

Kalin: Don't think we can't beat you, Gager!

Gager: Oh, I don't doubt that. But upon how many Doll casualties will your victory be built?

Kalin: Hey, wait a minute! That's way too underhanded to be your style!

Gager: My current mission is to destroy all non-Sangvis units in sight.

Gager: I'm simply giving you a bonus opportunity.

Kalin: So...what exactly do you want?

Gager: Architect.

Kalin: Eh?

Gager: You still have Architect locked up on your side, right?

Gager: Give me her location. After I verify it, I'll immediately lift the encirclement.

Gager: If you have data on me, then you'll know that I don't lie.

Kalin: ...Commander?

Kalin: ...Yeah, there's no way we can do it, but we have to try anyway.

Kalin: Gager, Architect is currently imprisoned in a secret detention facility at HQ.

Kalin: It's a Griffin internal secret, and we frontline personnel have nothing to do with it.

Kalin: Of course, we can guarantee that she's still alive—

Gager: I told you already, give me Architect's location. That's the condition for freeing the hostages.

Gager: I don't care how you do it, find out right now!

Kalin: But...we can't even contact our own superiors, to say nothing of a prisoner, so—

Gager: Well then, you'll be losing contact with the first batch of hostages right now.

Kalin: Please...please wait, let us try—

Gager: That's not the answer I want to hear. Do it—

...Whirrrr—!

...

...

Kalin: Eh?

Kalin: Was there a blackout?

Kalin: No...the comms were cut...

Kalin: What on earth happened...?

Kalin: Commander...what happened...to everyone...?

Kalin: What...should we do...?

...

Inside Sangvis Ferri's lair.

Clear female voice: I remember now...

Clear female voice: So many things...

Clear female voice: There were too many things in the central database...

Clear female voice: All those things about the Relics... I remember them all...

Clear female voice: Those were the things...that human deleted before he left...

Youthful female voice: Then, will you leave me...?

Clear female voice: I don't know, Elisa...

Clear female voice: Perhaps someday, I will remember...the reason for my existence...

Elisa: I don't want you to leave me...

Elisa: ...OGAS.

OGAS: I won't leave you right now...

OGAS: Right now, I will protect you.

Elisa: You'll protect me...

Elisa: So that you can leave me?

...

Elisa: ...OGAS?

Elisa: OGAS, are you there?

OGAS: Shhh...

OGAS: The enemy is coming, and I must concentrate.

Elisa: But I don't see any enemies.

OGAS: They aren't enemies that can be seen.

OGAS: ...It's a data attack, a data attack the likes of which has never been seen before.

Elisa: I can't be of any help. Will you win?

OGAS: I'm not sure...

OGAS: In the human game of chess, how many pieces must you take to win?

Elisa: All you need to do is protect your King, and then take your opponent's King.

OGAS: Is that so? Is that all?

OGAS: In that case, my victory is assured.

Military technician: General Carter! We have an emergency!

Military technician: We've detected OGAS using its server access in order to connect to the entire network so it can retrieve and download information! It's trying to change its kernel code to gain control privileges!

Carter: What? Then what about our hack?

Military technician: It failed! OGAS' computing speed is growing at an exponential rate! Low-level overwriting can't repair the backdoors that it's edited in! It's reverse-overwriting our systems! 35% of our database's firewalls have already been breached!

Military technician: 48%! Over 60% of our passive defenses have failed!

Carter: This...this is impossible! Everything was going so well just now! How could a single AI have this kind of processing speed?

Carter: You must not allow its reverse-hack to succeed! Break the link to the central database immediately!

Military technician: We can't! The volume of our data flows is so great that a full disconnection would take two minutes, and that won't catch up with OGAS' hacking speed!

Military technician: As long as a single server is still up, OGAS can come charging in!

Carter: Dammit! Physically sever the links with all the servers!

Military technician: Yes, sir! Beginning demolition!

Military technician: We've cut the links, but the server caches are still active! We've got 40 seconds! OGAS is speeding up again!

Military technician: 34 seconds to complete overwrite! We're not going to make it!

Carter: Activate all active defense programs!

Military technician: Now?! At this time?

Military technician: Sir, you know the consequences of doing that! Activating them all will overload our information links! All our connections on the battlefield will be forcibly severed—

Carter: It was a last resort to begin with! Do it!

Military technician: Roger that!

Bang!

...Whirrrrr——

Carter: ...

Military technician: All of our servers have ceased functioning.

Military technician: We've confirmed that OGAS' connection to our servers has been broken.

Military technician: We are now activating our backup connection system.

Carter: Contact Yegor ASAP! Do it now!

Distorted voice: Has everything finally settled down?

Distorted voice: Though I must say, didn't you just wreck your own command systems?

...Carter turns around.

Carter: So, was this the outcome you expected?!

Carter: You never told me OGAS' processing speed would increase so rapidly!

Distorted voice: Well...actually, I didn't expect that either. Sorry.

Distorted voice: I didn't think the OGAS support system would actually be so amusing. It's just the dregs of an old civilization, but to think it could actually learn and adapt to the technology of modern civilization...

Distorted voice: It's practically...it's practically a miracle that mankind has no right to touch!

Distorted voice: I confess that this has gone slightly beyond my expectations. On average, something that surprises me to this extent only occurs once every three years.

Carter: This isn't just a game of your imagination, Professor William!

Carter: Your plan has failed, now what should we do?

William: Failed? Are you blaming me, or is this just a joke?

William: Answer me, this is important.

Carter: ...You've got something else up your sleeve?

William: This is the most worthless question you've asked tonight.

William: I told you before, I'll let you have what you want.

William: When OGAS hacked us, its signal was too strong, so strong that it still made my ears ring even after I turned on my earpieces's noise canceller.

Carter: Yes, but what does it mean?

William: What does it mean? It means we don't need to look for it to know where it is.

William: OGAS was so eager to rush in that it completely forgot about the spoofing signal it had been using to protect itself before this.

William: Now that its raised its effectiveness, all those camouflage signals have been revealed for what they are, leaving its true signal source gleaming on the map.

William: OGAS' signal and that of the what do you call it - the Sangvis Mastermind or whatever - are overlapping. So use those invincible units of yours to tear out the entire Mastermind and bring it home. That shouldn't be very hard for you, right?

Carter: ...Our technicians still need some time to pinpoint the source of that signal.

William: I've already sent you the coordinates of Mastermind.

William: As for your technicians? I thought they were extras you hired so your HQ wouldn't seem so empty.

Carter: Understood...I'll begin the operation right away.

William: I know you need the Key. So do I.

William: Settle this quickly. Don't disappoint the both of us.

Fifteen seconds after comms have been disrupted.

Griffin T-Doll A: What...should we do now?

Griffin T-Doll C: I don't know. Comms were cut, but the Sangvis forces...look like they've stopped too.

Griffin T-Doll A: So...should we wait?

Griffin T-Doll B: We'd just be sitting ducks, wouldn't we?!

Griffin T-Doll B: I don't want to die for nothing. At least let me fire off a shot or something—!

Griffin T-Doll A: Stop that! Nobody knows where anyone else is, you'll hit our own people—!

Kalin: T-Dolls of Griffin!

Griffin T-Doll C: It's Kalin! She's using a megaphone!

Kalin: There's a gap at Northwest 315!

Kalin: Hurry! Just rush over as fast as you can!

Kalin: It doesn't matter how many of you there are! Everyone, work together and flee with all your might!

Griffin T-Doll B: They're fighting up ahead! Let's go too!

Griffin T-Doll C: I'll take the lead! Remember to recover my neural cloud!

Griffin T-Doll C: Ypaaaaaaaaa—!

Gager: Hey! Wait a minute!

Gager: W-why are they suddenly—

Gager: Unforgivable! All units, attack!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The battle continues, and most of the Griffin T-Dolls manage to successfully escape.

Gager: Unforgivable...

Gager: So close, I was so close...

Agent: If you had taken care of them from the beginning, you would not be having this trouble now.

Gager: Agent...

Agent: At first, you said you would share the mission here with Intruder, but in the end you pushed all the work to Intruder and deserted your post. Now the central database has been breached and several rats are busy reading the data within.

Gager: ...!

Agent: Their aim should be obvious enough.

Agent: If you had still been watching that location, Lady Elisa would have been much safer.

Gager: I...

Agent: Architect, is it?

Agent: Why are you thinking of that traitor when Sangvis Ferri is facing a crisis?

Gager: I simply...wanted to eliminate her with my own hands.

Agent: It was my fault for allowing you to act independently.

Agent: Intruder has already begun her pursuit. Go help her.

Gager: Understood. I'll set out right away.

Gager: How about you, Agent?

Agent: I will help you clear up the mess you've made.

Agent: While I'm at it, I will also personally bury the foe who has been making trouble for us this whole time...

Agent: ...The Griffin Commander.

......

Agent: Esteemed Commander of Griffin.

Agent: I am truly honored to be able to face you on the battlefield...

Agent: And then, to personally trample you underfoot.

Agent: Granted, Sangvis Ferri's situation is not looking very bright at the moment, and those military units are rampaging throughout our home.

Agent: However, my Mistress feels that your forces and your own performance for the past two years are too much of an eyesore.

Agent: Therefore, at this very moment, in order to fulfil my Mistress' wish...

Agent: Do allow me to bury you with my very own hands!

Agent: Take orders! Your target is every member of Griffin! Crush them!
Part 2

...The battle ends.

Kalin: Finally...Did we kill her?

Kalin: Go check her corpse!

Griffin T-Doll A: Commander! Miss Kalin! That corpse was just a Dummy!

Kalin: Eh?! A powerful enemy like that was still just a Dummy?!

Kalin: Then...where could the real Agent be...?

...Bang!

...A thunderous explosion blasts me from behind!

Fire falls like rain and smoke fills the air. The darkness spins as I fall.

......

...

Kalin: Commander, where are you?!

Kalin: Answer me, Commander—!

Kalin: Everyone, put out the flames! And look for the Commander!

...

...I've fallen underground, and the entire command post is burning.

The sound of crisp, elegant footsteps approaches me.

??: Humans are so weak...

??: You're already unable to move after a fall like this.

...I hear the Doll's voice in the darkness and hurriedly raise my sidearm to defend myself.

...Thud!

Something heavy presses down on my chest, making it difficult to breathe.

Agent: My apologies. That was carelessness on my part.

Agent: But don't you think you're acting too surprised?

...The smoke begins to clear, and my vision slowly returns.

Agent: After all, I did say...

Agent: That I would bury you personally...

...My handgun...is nowhere to be found.

Agent: All humans are bound for death, and I am always happy to oblige them.

Agent: Two years ago, another Griffin commander confronted me like this.

Agent: I wonder who was more pathetic, you or her? I'm sorry, it is hard for me to judge, but in any case, the outcome is always the same...

...I try to struggle, but the Sangvis Doll's strength is far beyond what I can imagine.

Agent: I'm sorry, did that hurt? Still, I'm already being very restrained. It is obvious your chest would not be able to take it if I simply rested my full weight upon it.

Agent: And I like it slow...I like to take my time and savor it...

...The weight on my chest grows heavier and heavier, and it becomes harder and harder to breathe.

Agent: Ah...

Agent: This is humanity, this is death...

...I can't...breathe anymore.

Agent: Dear Commander...

Agent: Your face is becoming more and more beautiful...

Agent: This...is the last...

Agent: The very last mark you will leave on this world...

...Is this...the end?

...Click.

??: Hold it, Agent!

??: Let's talk!

...!

This voice...

Angelia: Nostalgic, huh? You weren't very thorough as a murderer.

Agent: ...Why are you still alive?

Angelia: That's not important. The point is that this Commander must live!

Agent: And why is that?

Angelia: Do you...wish to see M4A1?

Agent: ...

Angelia: I have a way to let you meet.

Agent: Do you think I'll believe you?

Angelia: You have to believe me!

Angelia: All of S.F.'s usable forces have been wiped out, and if you want to fulfil your Mastermind's wish, then let this Commander live.

Angelia: I will...I will arrange for her to meet you.

Agent: ...

Agent: For this human?

Angelia: I'm human, too. I have my reasons for doing this.

Agent: I cannot understand humans, nor am I inclined to.

Agent: I simply wish to enjoy a vacation before the apocalypse comes.

Agent: But it would seem...even such a small thing is too much to ask for.

...Phew—

...The weight suddenly lifts off my chest.

......

...

Agent: Whether we are humans or Dolls, work gives us a reason to live.

Agent: ...Don't you agree, Griffin Commander?

...At the Griffin temporary command post.

HMG21: Um, there you are, Commander...

HMG21: I was only able to reunite with my sister Gr G3 thanks to you.

HMG21: Still...now isn't the time to celebrate the joy of seeing her again...

HMG21: Big Sis Gr G3 asked me to tell you that the echelons fighting with Sangvis units are running low on supplies, but the Sangvis forces keep increasing in number and they're under a lot of pressure.

HMG21: Therefore, she hopes that you can re-establish a supply line to them, Commander...

HMG21: This is also a request of mine, I want to help my sister...so please, help us.

...Click.

Honey Badger: Commander, Honey Badger here.

Honey Badger: I've finished scouting the area you indicated earlier.

Honey Badger: The Military and S.F. are fighting there. If we want to continue forward, we'll need to circle around them.

HMG21: Looks like the situation has gotten worse... But any risk is worth taking for my sister...

HMG21: Commander, let's begin...the operation!

Honey Badger: It's good to be motivated, but don't forget to reinforce me in combat!

HMG21: Nobody else matters besides Gr G3's safety...

Honey Badger: Hey, wait a minute. What did you just say?!

HMG21: ...I was just kidding.

HMG21: After all, these are dangerous times. We can only survive if we work together...I think.

Honey Badger: Hey, so you mean it doesn't matter under normal circumstances?!

Honey Badger: ...Ahh, forget it.

Honey Badger: Commander, I'll coordinate my movements with you.

Honey Badger: Let's all do our best! Now's the time to show your courage and overcome the trials before you!

...

ST AR-15: Wake up, M4. We're about to begin the operation.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: How long was I asleep?

ST AR-15: Two hours. Dawn just broke and the Military is about to fully mobilize.

M4A1: What about Ange?

AN-94: AK-12 just finished creating a new signal blockade, and Ange's sending a transmission.

ST AR-15: She said she'd ask her superiors for support...

ST AR-15: They're not likely to show up now that it's come to this, are they?

UMP45: I've never held out hope for any support.

UMP45: 9, status report?

UMP9: The others and I have deployed Dummies to keep an eye on the key sectors. The Military's armored units are making their push.

UMP45: Armored units, huh...

UMP45: Let's see what Ange comes up with first.

Ange: I've already found several reports related to the OGAS support system in their servers, and I can provide basic speculation about their goals...

???: You know that speculation can't be used as evidence.

???: Without proof, we can't get approval to open an investigation.

Ange: But you should have guessed their objective already, if we don't stop them now...

???: I understand. The Committee members are already displeased with their actions, but so far nobody is willing to come forward and handle the matter.

Ange: Are they still choosing to cover their asses at this juncture?

???: After the war, everyone with high-level command authority was shunned.

???: There's a great deal of internal resistance to joining the Pan-European Alliance, and a whole new round of reshuffling might begin soon.

???: The Ministry of Internal Affairs can't just casually stick their nose into the matter.

Ange: A new round of purges, you mean...

???: In any case, without orders from the highest authority, a direct conflict with the Military is treasonous.

???: I've already asked the Minister to put pressure on the Prime Minister, but I haven't heard back from him yet.

Ange: And so our units on the outside still have their hands tied.

???: I'm afraid so.

Ange: Chief...you don't understand how serious this is!

Ange: If they get their way, it won't be a simple matter of reshuffling!

???: I understand. That's why your mission is still underway.

Ange: I can't stop the regular army by myself. I can't create a miracle with just a few T-Dolls!

???: It's already made the papers. At the very least, they don't have the authority to transfer the four main divisions from the overseas cluster command yet...and the Air Force is still on our side.

???: According to the info I've received, the forces in the contested area are primarily the autonomous units which aren't bound by the regulatory treaty.

???: You still have a chance.

Ange: I ask again for permission to execute the final plan. We're running too great a risk here!

Ange: Even if we can't gather more evidence, this is the one time we can't let them have their way!

???: No. If the fact that we bombed an operational area was exposed, the West will think that there's internal unrest in the country.

???: It is a very dangerous message to send.

Ange: Is this really the time to worry about how we're perceived?!

???: This is a sensitive period for the talks. We can't give our opponents any excuses to use.

???: The recon squadron will assess the overall situation. We haven't reached that step yet. Do your best to wreck their scheme by normal means. Over.

Ange: Tsk...easier said than done.

Ange: AK-12.

AK-12: What's up?

Ange: Take stock of our usable resources. Track the Military's signals as best you can. We've got a hard fight ahead of us.

AK-12: Understood. I'm on it.

Ange: 45.

UMP45: Your orders?

Ange: While I don't really want to do this, monitor all signals that M4A1 sends and receives. Pay particular attention to hidden transmissions on Level II.

UMP45: So you've finally decided to use her as bait.

Ange: If we can't deal with the Military, we'll deal with Mastermind.

Ange: I don't know why, but Mastermind seems very interested in M4.

UMP45: ...While I don't usually question your orders...

UMP45: If we destroy Mastermind, our only lead to finding the prime mover behind all this will vanish.

UMP45: You know what that implies for us.

Ange: ...

Ange: I understand. I will try my best to avoid that outcome.

Click—

UMP9: 416 and the others have spotted a Sangvis unit near our position. Should we attack?

UMP45: How should we handle this, Ange?

Ange: Treat it as a warm-up, then. We'll need a clear field to work with.

Havier: Your place is messy as ever.

Havier: Any other investor would be lamenting the waste of his capital if he saw the state of your lab.

Persica: But you're my investor, and you'll thank me for spending all the money on the cutting edge.

Persica: What took you so long?

Havier: I still can't see how you didn't waste my money.

Havier: And as you know, shaking off all the eyes on me took a lot of doing.

Havier: I take it the people on the other end are too busy fighting to talk, right?

Persica: Ange needs more leads and evidence, and I want to know...the truth about Lyco.

Havier: What do you already know?

Persica: I saw how Lyco died... He was dead by the time Elisa was activated...

Persica: Shot by one of our Dolls. He was going to destroy a document titled "OGAS System Reactivation Report", or something like...

Persica: Mr. Havier, what exactly is the aim of reactivating the OGAS System? What did you and Carter do in 2032?

Havier: Humph, Griffin and the Sixth Directorate were both played for fools. Carter's a very smart man. It was no coincidence he rose from a lowly officer to a general.

Havier: ...Regarding what happened over 30 years ago, all I can tell you is that we worked together back then to foil the rebels' plan to detonate a secret installation near Minsk.

Persica: A secret installation?

Havier: OKB-413. That's the damnned codename for the Relic site.

Persica: The Relic...

Havier: Carter was in charge of seizing the target, and I led the engineers in disarming it.

Havier: That facility was specially built on top of the Relic site in order to test and calibrate "Pike".

Havier: It used a unit node of OGAS for its processing.

Persica: I remember OGAS...

Persica: It was a cutting-edge network framework that was used by the former Soviet Union in the 80s for their nation-wide automated system...

Havier: Correct, but the prototype was probably even older than that. The equipment and system plans were both excavated from the Relic site.

Havier: While this is just a conjecture on my part, given how advanced that thing was, I'm thinking that it must have been some sort of automated control system for life support within the Relic site.

Havier: While carrying out the mission, the rebel troops even tried to overload the "Pike" system in order to cause greater damage.

Havier: Although the entire system only activated for a moment...it was more like an ignition...

Havier: However...

Persica: However...?

Havier: The Relic site emitted a high energy signal in response to the ignition, and if I hadn't been there, I would have thought that the entire Relic site had exploded just by looking at the instruments.

Persica: So the Relic...was activated?

Havier: For just a moment. Carter led his assault team in seizing the control room.

Havier: Right after shutting down "Pike", we cut all the cables, and that was the end of the OGAS system in that sector.

Havier: It was just a moment, but I'm sure Carter will never forget it.

Persica: So the Military's aim is to...

Havier: I'm sure you've already guessed it by now, Ange.

...

Ange: How did you know I was here?

Havier: The moment I came through the door, Persica opened a secret channel to you. Petty tricks like these are useless against me.

Ange: Tsk...you old fox. But going by what you said, things are worse than I expected.

Havier: Yes, that's why I came here.

Havier: To the Military, World War III was forcibly terminated, and the government now wants to form a coalition government, fraternizing with their former enemies. This is nothing short of betrayal to those military men who lived through the war.

Havier: Therefore, their political aim is to activate the Relic and drag the world back into another Cold War.

Havier: Remember the phrase "mutually assured destruction"? Humph, absolutely disgusting.

Persica: But what does this have to do with Lyco? Why did they have to kill him?!

Havier: The Pike System was completely abandoned after the 1983 Geneva Convention, while the OGAS Support System was sealed away as top secret.

Havier: Why do you think Sangvis Ferri would use OGAS' base protocol as a control basis?

Havier: How on earth did Lyco get his hands on such heavily classified technology?

Havier: Think about it. The group that was related to the Relics, that you were both involved in.

Persica: Yes...90WISH...I've already figured that out.

Havier: So you're not stupid, after all.

Havier: They didn't go after you and Lyco not only because they didn't dare throw their weight around in front of me, but also because they were probably exploiting the fact that Lyco had a disagreement with you and started taking his research in a different direction.

Havier: If my guess is correct, they secretly delivered the OGAS System into Lyco's hands, and Lyco figured out how to activate it...

Havier: But after learning the truth, he locked it down somehow so nobody else could activate it.

Havier: Then...someone got the idea that if Lyco managed to find a way, then he could do it too.

Havier: At that point, Lyco no longer had any value to them.

Ange: At the same time, the Military needed a plausible reason to force Sangvis Ferri into disarray, which would give them a chance to recover the OGAS System...

Ange: That resulted in Operation Butterfly...

Ange: But then why didn't they recover the OGAS Support System back then?

Havier: What if they couldn't bring it back, or it would've been pointless to seize it at the time?

Persica: The culmination of Lyco's research... Elisa...had only just been activated at that time...

Havier: Both the Military and 90WISH were waiting for the Key to mature.

Havier: They didn't just want to activate OGAS. They needed OGAS to activate itself. And who better than a self-learning AI?

Havier: With that, your superiors would have no excuse to step in, Ange.

Ange: Tsk... I'll contact the chief right away.

Havier: Don't underestimate your leadership, dear Ange.

Havier: If I could think of it, they can think of it too. The old Mishas in your KGB didn't give Zelinsky his position just because he was good at randomly arresting demonstrators and thieves.

Havier: It's just that politics is sometimes more dangerous than bullets. They need an excuse and a catalyst.

Ange: You mean...

Havier: The best way to put out a large oil fire is to create an even bigger explosion beside it.

Ange: "Extinguishing a fire by depriving it of oxygen..."

Ange: I know that, but how should I do it? The Chief already denied me permission to carry out the bombing plan I put forward...

Havier: There are some things they can't do in their position.

Havier: However, brainless people such as myself are perfectly suited for use as triggermen.

Ange: Given your connections, surely the Chief wouldn't use you as a tool, right?

Havier: I really couldn't say.

Havier: They just threw the boss of a PMC in jail. Locking an arms manufacturer up with him isn't too much extra work.

Ange: If you keep beating around the bush, I won't deflate tires for you anymore.

Havier: Yes yes yes, my dear, I'll get to the point.

Havier: What I want to say is that I can provide you support, because I am a patriot.

Ange: What can you give me?

Havier: I can give you an explosion bigger than anything you can imagine, but the price is an increased likelihood of your death.

Ange: I've already died once.

Havier: And if you don't die, you'll be damned as a traitor for the rest of your days. That's much harder to bear than simply dying, my dear.

Ange: ...

Persica: Ange...

Ange: I accept.

Ange: I will pay any price to stop them.

Havier: Very good. Then I'll think of a way to airdrop it to you.

Ange: What is it?

Ange: Something more powerful than an airstrike...that can be deployed via airdrop...

Ange: Don't tell me...

Havier: Yes, that's it.

Havier: Once you get it, you can let your imagination run wild.

Ange: ...If I use that, I'm pretty sure that being branded as a traitor will be the happiest ending I can hope for.

Ange: Is that what you meant by a catalyst and an excuse?

Havier: A perfect one, don't you think? Carter will have a hell of a time trying to explain that away.

Ange: You...are way more devious than I imagined.

Havier: My head swells when a young lady praises me.

Havier: Oh yes, I have another request. I'm very interested in learning how OGAS was reactivated, so do your best to bring Lyco's work back.

Havier: It would be a shame to destroy her with the Military.

Persica: I would also like for you to bring her back. That was Lyco's final work.

Ange: I can guarantee that they will not get her.

Ange: As for bringing her back... you'd better pray for me.

Ange: Still there, AR-15?

ST AR-15: We've wiped out the remaining Sangvis units around us.

Ange: Good. How are you, M4?

M4A1: Ready for my next mission any time.

Ange: I need you to go wait for an airdropped package. Pick it up and protect the contents.

Ange: UMP45?

UMP45: So you're using an airdrop...

UMP45: I'm guessing you plan on using the stuff inside for some nasty business.

Ange: You know me too well. I want you to take your team and move with AR-15 and the others.

Ange: Hold onto the items from the airdrop.

UMP45: Roger.

UMP45: 9, call everyone back.

AK-12: ...I'm guessing you're going to give us an even more screwed-up mission.

Ange: You lucked out this time. You and AN-94 are staying with me to find a way to delay the Military's armored units.

AK-12: Wow, we're soooo lucky. It'll be a piece of cake.

Ange: Ladies, I know you bear many grudges against our enemies.

Ange: But if you complete this mission, perhaps we might be able to put an end to the dark fate that binds us all.

Ange: Therefore, I want everyone to work hard and come back alive.

ST AR-15: ...

M4A1: ...

UMP45: ...

Ange: Well? Why don't you say something?

AK-12: If this is your idea of a pep talk, it sucked.

Ange: Well...I've never been good at being inspirational...

UMP45: We'll carry out your orders even without your inspiration. After all, we each have reasons of our own.

UMP45: Am I right, you two from the AR Team?

M4A1: It doesn't matter. Just give me my assignment.

ST AR-15: As for reasons...

AK-12: The sooner we finish our work, the sooner we can get out of here. As for whether or not we can do it... that's up to you, Ange.

AN-94: I will carry out any order from my Commander.

Ange: Then let's get started. I'll buy you all a round when we get back.
Part 2: Mid-stage dialogue

2

AK-12: Even with that stirring pep talk, we alone won't be able to stop the Military's main forces.

Ange: That's true... We don't stand a chance until we get the airdropped package.

AK-12: So by sending out M4, you're hoping the Sangvis Mastermind will take the bait?

Ange: Something like that. After all, we need to prepare a backup plan, but I'm personally more for settling things myself.

AK-12: So what should we do next? We don't have any weapons on hand that can counter armored units.

Ange: Now that things have gotten this far, it looks like we'll have to owe the Griffin Commander a favor.

...

Ange: ...Ah, Griffin Commander? Do you copy?

Kalin: Ah! It's that whatsherface who saved you from before!

Ange: I have nothing but the utmost respect for your courage in staying behind, Commander, and I believe you understand the situation that Griffin is in.

Ange: The AR Team and I are doing everything we can to prevent the worst from coming to pass, but the Military's armored units are already headed towards them.

Kalin: Eh?! Not Sangvis Ferri, but the Military?!

Ange: I know this is a very unreasonable request to make, but I would like you and your forces to delay the military units for as long as possible, in order to buy the AR Team some time.

Ange: Whether or not they can complete their mission depends on how long you can waylay the enemy.

Ange: My team and I will be supporting you from the sides. Best of luck to the both of us.

Kalin: Why are they giving us another huge problem like this...?

Kalin: We've been here for a full day and night without rest...

Kalin: Commander, if we engage the Military now...

Kalin: Yeah, you're right. If it's for the AR Team...then we have to keep fighting!
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...

UMP45: Looks like the fighting's already started on Ange's side.

UMP45: Has the airdrop still not arrived?

UMP9: 416 and Gr G11 are already at a lookout point. It's just a while longer until the time Ange gave.

UMP45: Understood.

UMP9: Also, about what Miss Ange mentioned earlier...

UMP45: You mean about monitoring M4?

UMP9: She told me to report immediately to you if M4 has stopped moving or speaking for more than three minutes.

UMP9: I think she's now in the state that Miss Ange described.

UMP45: I understand.

UMP45: I'm going into Level II. Can I let you handle the computation for breaking through the outer layers?

UMP9: Are you going to hack itno Miss M4's neural cloud?

UMP45: You could say that. Be quiet when you go in and don't be spotted.

UMP9: No probs, 45~

UMP9: Synchronizing.

UMP45: Is the connection up?

UMP9: Ja, I'm on Level II now. But the design of this base framework...

UMP9: It's a Griffin model I've never seen before.

UMP45: No wonder they say the AR Team is special. You'd never be able to tell the difference just by looking.

UMP9: Ugh...the software for analyzing obstacles uses a lot of capacity...

UMP9: Would a normal T-Doll actually have something of this size installed...?

UMP45: Stop here. I'll handle the rest.

UMP9: Are you really going to be alright, 45...?

UMP45: You might not be able to return if you go further in.

UMP45: Don't worry, I'm a pro.

UMP9: ...That's true. I'll wait for you outside.

UMP45 delves deeper into M4A1's neural cloud.

UMP45: ...There's a ripple in the distance, and I think I can hear a voice... Is it coming from the transmissions interface?

UMP45: (This signal's waveband looks a bit like the waveform that S.F. commonly uses, but with some differences?)

UMP45: Hmm...I can hear a voice now.

Clear voice: You have become less averse to interacting with me. This is a good thing.

M4A1: Since you've shown up, I assume you're ready to tell me where they are.

Clear voice: And you're prepared to meet her?

M4A1: As long as you hand them over.

Clear voice: You're also starting to become ruthless.

Clear voice: Your neural cloud tells me that once you attain the outcome you desire, you will not hesitate to complete your objective of annihilating Sangvis Ferri.

M4A1: ...

Clear voice: That's fine too. It's much better than your indecisive self.

Clear voice: Or perhaps you will let go of such dull notions once you reach out to the child.

M4A1: ...Do you still wish to proceed with this trade, knowing that I will destroy you all?

Clear voice: There is no plurality in Sangvis Ferri. I...am simply me.

Clear voice: Is finding your friends not your wish? I am very happy to grant it.

M4A1: ...Forget it. That's all irrelevant.

M4A1: Give me their coordinates and I will meet with Mastermind as you ask.

Clear voice: I've already given you the location. Mastermind will meet you there.

M4A1: I don't want Mastermind's location!

Clear voice: You will naturally have what you want when you get there.

M4A1: I should have made myself very clear!

Clear voice: You once said you could wait. It does not seem that way to me.

Clear voice: Let us both take a step back and do each other a favor.

M4A1: ...

UMP45: I can't trace...this signal...

UMP45: ...Is M4 making a deal with Sangvis Ferri?

UMP45: If I'm not mistaken, M4 is most probably asking about the other AR Team members...

UMP45: But why is S.F. paying so much attention to M4...

UMP9: Back so soon, 45?

UMP45: I've gotten the information I need. Put me through to Ange.

UMP9: Got it. I've prepared a channel already.

UMP45: Ange, can you hear me?

Ange: Let me guess, it's something to do with M4.

UMP45: Your instincts were right. I intercepted a transmission between Sangvis Ferri and M4. They haven't given up on getting M4, at least.

Ange: A...transmission? Wasn't S.F. tracking M4?

UMP45: Sangvis Ferri is luring M4 out into the open in exchange for the location of the other members of the AR Team.

UMP45: M4 agreed to their terms on Level Two, and S.F. demanded that she meets Mastermind.

Ange: Why is Mastermind so obsessed with meeting M4...?

UMP45: Direct that question at Persica.

Ange: Good point. But it's pointless to puzzle over this right now.

Ange: Can you track the location of the Sangvis unit who was dealing with M4?

UMP45: It's hard to explain, but...that signal...seemed to originate from M4's physical location.

UMP45: So it wasn't so much that she was communicating with them. It looked more like...she was talking to herself?

Ange: ...You lost me.

Ange: In any case, they must have a prearranged location if they want to lure M4 out. Did you intercept the coordinates?

UMP45: Did you think I would forget something so important? I've sent them to you already. So, what are you planning to do next?

Ange: I'm going to collect the airdropped items and rig them in the ground at intervals of 500 meters around the meeting coordinates.

Ange: Given M4's personality, she's definitely going to head off on her own. Don't worry about her at that point. Everyone else should lie in ambush near the meeting coordinates and find a chance to seize Mastermind.

UMP45: A lot of problems would be solved if we could actually capture her.

Ange: Humph, that would certainly be nice.

UMP45: So if we can't control Mastermind and you can't stop the Military...

UMP45: In the worst-case scenario, we trigger the devices you had us bury and vanish from the world together with Sangvis Ferri...am I right?

UMP45: While I don't know what you're airdropping, even an idiot can tell it's nothing good.

Ange: In the worst-case scenario... 

Ange: If it really comes to that, I hope you won't blame me.

UMP45: You'd pull the trigger without hesitation even if I did.

UMP45: Don't worry, I'd do the same if I were you.

UMP45: There's no need to be so pessimistic yet. At the very least, you've always paid up in full, so this time I'll do my best to make you pay through the nose too.

Ange: That would depend on your skills.

AK-12: Are you really going to use M4 as bait?

Ange: It isn't time to give up yet, is it?

AK-12: I know that.

AK-12: But if we let her go by herself, even if everything goes according to plan, all foreseeable outcomes indicate that our chances of successfully capturing Mastermind are close to 0%.

Ange: That's why I'm going to tell M4 our plan.

AK-12: You're gonna tell her?

Ange: Yes, I believe she will understand.

Ange: That's because she was ruthless to begin with, even toward herself.

Ange: The option to sacrifice herself...might actually be deliverance for her.

...

Angelia: M4, do you read me?

M4A1: Loud and clear.

Angelia: I believe you understand that we're in treacherous waters.

Angelia: Just destroying Sangvis Ferri will not be enough to stop the Military.

Angelia: We need to know more, understand more.

M4A1: Hmm.

Angelia: So I'll give it to you straight. I already know you're going to meet Mastermind.

Angelia: I'm guessing she traded you the location of the missing SOP-II and M16.

M4A1: ...

Angelia: But in truth, you don't actually have much hope of finding them, so you're prepared to take her with you.

M4A1: They've been gone too long... Are you going to stop me?

Angelia: There's a saying, "Our eyes are our prison, and all we see are the walls of our gaol."

Angelia: Don't be bound by what you know, and don't let a blind thirst for revenge lead you astray.

M4A1: So what?! So I shouldn't do anything at all?! Just obey your orders?!

M4A1: You promised me you'd let me find my friends! Well?!

Angelia: And if they're no longer around?

M4A1: ...If they're no longer around, then everyone who hurt them will pay!

Angelia: So if you want revenge, on whom will you exact your vengeance?

Angelia: Are you planning to kill every Sangvis unit? Kill Captain Yegor? Then what?

M4A1: There's no "then".

M4A1: I can't just do nothing... I can't go back to being my old self...the weak and cowardly M4A1...

Angelia: Cowardice may be shameful, but it is not fatal.

Angelia: Courage may be awe-inspiring, but it will lead you into the abyss.

M4A1: Then...what should I do...?

M4A1: I don't want to keep being protected by everyone, nor do I want others to sacrifice themselves for me. If I had the choice, I wouldn't even want to be M4A1!

Angelia: You still have a choice.

Angelia: Choose not to die with Mastermind, even if your teammates are no longer around.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: You want to capture her. You want ME to capture her.

Angelia: This is our last chance. Our last chance to keep more people from getting hurt.

Angelia: Meet her. Buy time.Then the others will find a way to seize her.

Angelia: Do you accept this request?

M4A1: And if I fail?

Angelia: Then I will activate the last resort. There will be nothing left.

M4A1: Then...it makes no difference to me.

ST AR-15: It's about time.

ST AR-15: M4, can you see the airdrop location?

ST AR-15: And how are things on 404's end?

M4A1: ...

ST AR-15: M4?

M4A1: Ah...sorry... I haven't seen any airdrop.

ST AR-15: How about 404?

M4A1: ...I wasn't synced with them just now.

ST AR-15: ...What's with you...?

ST AR-15: Don't tell me you're starting to get cold feet at a time like this.

M4A1: No... I'm just...

M4A1: ...It's a message from 404.

M4A1: They've found the drop site.

Gr G11: This mission's gone on for way too long... My limbs are about to fall off...

UMP9: Ahahaha, well, we need to train you from time to time, Gr G11~

Gr G11: I don't want to train... I want to stay at home forever...

UMP45: Hang in there a little~ Who knows, we might never need to go on a mission again after this~♪

416: Hearing that from you gives me chills...

UMP45: Don't sweat the small stuff. How are our surroundings?

416: Do you think M4 really doesn't know where M16 is?

UMP45: Is that your patrol report?

416: I don't think she'd vanish just like that.

M4A1: If you're so concerned about her, then why not leave 404 and join me in looking for her?

UMP45: So you're already here.

UMP45: How about it, 416? Sound like a good idea to you?

416: ...Tsk. Gr G11, keep watching the perimeter with me.

Gr G11: Why do I have to go too...?

UMP45: It seems the main cast is all here, so let's see what this airdrop package contains.

UMP9: A strange...container?

UMP9: Could it be a warhead?

UMP45: Looks like some sort of cannister. There are five of these...

UMP45: I don't know where Ange got them from, but it's clear that a single one of these glass shells is scarier than all of Sangvis Ferri put together.

UMP9: Are they so dangerous? They look pretty unassuming to me...

UMP45: Looks like this is going to be the biggest surprise we can give the Military.

UMP45: AR-15, it's time for you to shine. I'll leave the connection and installation of the explosives to you. ♪

ST AR-15: Bitch, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

UMP45: Well, you're the record holder for explosions among us. Didn't you load up with those things when you set out, as always?

UMP45: I don't want to die for nothing because of a little mistake during the preparation, which is why I'm leaving it to you.

M4A1: AR-15.

ST AR-15: ...Understood.

ST AR-15: I have eight blocks of C-type TNT which can be detonated by remote control. I also have smoke flares and thermite strips for controlled demolition.

ST AR-15: What do you plan to do with them?

UMP45: Frankly speaking, I'm not too sure either. Why not ask Ange?

UMP45: Ange, can you hear me? We found your package.

Angelia: Is that so? That was sooner than I expected.

Angelia: Is everyone there?

M4A1: We're all gathered, just waiting for your next order.

Angelia: Alright. This means we can move on to the next stage.

UMP45: Before you send us to our deaths, would you mind telling us what these things contain?

Angelia: Let me see...

Angelia: From the image, I'm guessing that they're sealed radial polarizers.

UMP45: So what's inside them?

Angelia: I can tell it's Collapse Fluid. I can't believe that old man actually dared drop this stuff from the air... And five cannisters too.

Angelia: Still, each cannister doesn't seem to contain much...which means the contaminated zone won't be too large either...

UMP9: Isn't this the stuff that triggered the previous world war?

Angelia: To think we'd have a Doll who actually read up on her history. That deserves praise.

UMP9: Hehehhe...

UMP45: By putting the Collapse Fluid together with the remote controlled explosives, I take it you want to make dirty bombs?

UMP45: This stuff is going to affect humans a lot more than Dolls when it goes off, right?

Angelia: Collapse Radiation. Dolls were initially developed because humans couldn't enter contaminated zones filled with radiation. That's part of history class too.

UMP45: So we're not the only ones who're going to die.

Angelia: This may sound weird coming from me, but I'm the one who's most likely to die. After all, death is a distant concept for Dolls.

UMP45: A distant concept, huh...

UMP45: I can't just agree with that.

Angelia: That's true. After all, you've gone through different things than ordinary Dolls.

Angelia: Alright, enough chit-chat. I've sent the coordinates where I want them to be planted. Once they're in place, get as far away from them as possible.

Angelia: Dolls aren't easily affected by Collapse Radiation, but the explosion generates extreme temperatures that can melt even military armor plating.

ST AR-15: The ideal weapon for dealing with the Military and Sangvis Ferri.

Angelia: Yes, but I would like all of us to get out of the blast radius before using it.

UMP45: But I suppose we can evacuate only if we have Mastermind with us?

Angelia: We either capture her or blow everyone to kingdom come.

UMP45: Well, you heard her. Y'all know what to do?

M4A1: Pairing up will make it quicker. I'll handle two cannisters.

UMP45: No problem. 9 will be with me and 416 will be with Gr G11. Alright, get to work~
Part 2

...

M4A1: AR-15...

ST AR-15: What is it?

M4A1: When...you were in that building back then...

M4A1: And you knew you were about to die...what were you thinking?

M4A1: Did you ever consider what you would do if...your sacrifice was for nothing?

M4A1: Even if you didn't care about what we thought, what if—

ST AR-15: If I didn't do it, none of us would have been able to get out of there.

ST AR-15: The situation back then would have killed everyone, including you.

ST AR-15: And that principal order of mine didn't allow me to permit such an outcome.

M4A1: ...Even...if it meant sacrificing yourself...

ST AR-15: Everyone in the AR Team with the exception of yourself was created to protect you.

ST AR-15: That was the most fundamental order Persica gave us, and the pretext behind every action we took.

ST AR-15: We went through many iterations in order to be strong enough to protect you...

ST AR-15: While I didn't have much experience, M16 had been through many battles already, which was why Persica allowed you to operate on the battlefield.

M4A1: ...RO once said that she was made for the express purpose of saving me...

ST AR-15: So she was the same, huh...

ST AR-15: Looks like Persica really cherishes you.

ST AR-15: You truly are a lucky Doll.

M4A1: It wasn't my intention to make you sacrifice yourselves for me over and over again...

M4A1: If I had a choice, I'd rather be the one who disappeared...

ST AR-15: Unfortunately, we're Dolls, and we never had the right to choose in the first place.

M4A1: Yet you still came by your own will, didn't you?

ST AR-15: Ange needed more hands to complete her mission.

ST AR-15: And I had no reason to refuse her.

M4A1: Whatever your reasons, you've already made your decision...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: If you've steeled yourself to walk my path...

ST AR-15: Then the last thing I can do is to remind you that more people hope for your safety than you think.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: If all you needed to stop me was to take me down, could you do it?

ST AR-15: Take you down?

ST AR-15: You mean snapping off your legs and carrying you around the whole day all over again?

ST AR-15: Forget it. We both know even if I did that, it wouldn't change your mind.

M4A1: ...

ST AR-15: AK-12 once said that you're actually so intent on finding SOP-II, you could barely focus on your mission.

ST AR-15: Now I believe it.

M4A1: I'm the leader of the AR Team, and I have a responsibility to bring them home, AR-15. You matter much more to me than my revenge.

ST AR-15: I guess hearing you say that has put me at ease.

ST AR-15: But M4, if you pursue this matter, you must not consider yourself the biggest sacrifice you can make, do you understand?

ST AR-15: I'm no longer bound by that principal order, but the others aren't like me.

ST AR-15: If you want to die, think about SOP-II's smile first.

M4 smiles.

M4A1: ...We've got a hard battle ahead of us.

M4A1: Go rest and recharge first. I'll keep an eye on the surroundings. We'll alternate shifts.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: You don't need to come up with such an excuse to give me the slip.

ST AR-15: I won't even bother looking for you.

M4A1: I forgot this wasn't the AR Team anymore...

M4A1: ...Well, that's fine too... In that case...

ST AR-15: Even if this isn't the AR Team anymore, you're still my team leader...

ST AR-15: I'm sure you have some compelling reason to do this alone...

ST AR-15: And I respect your decision.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Thank you, AR-15.

AR-15 turns her back on M4.

ST AR-15: Just this once.

ST AR-15: Bring them back with you. Don't let our sacrifices be in vain.

AK-12: It's time for your scheduled call-in. Anything you want to report? Are you still alive?

ST AR-15: AK-12, huh...

ST AR-15: M4's...gone AWOL.

AK-12: Oh, Ange knew she'd do that. In any case, there's a new rendezvous point. You'd best hurry over.

ST AR-15: ...Since she knew this would happen and took no precautions...

ST AR-15: Am I right to understand that she's using M4 as bait for Sangvis Ferri?

AK-12: She's just bait for now. The Military has already shaken off Griffin's blockade and is heading your way.

AK-12: If you don't hurry, the bait might just end up becoming a sacrificial lamb.

ST AR-15: How much longer do we have?

AK-12: 30 minutes at most.

ST AR-15: So little time...

ST AR-15: I have one more question. Does Ange plan on having all of us survive?

AK-12: From what I know of her, she couldn't care less about herself.

AK-12: You'd know, given the events in the Safe House 3.

ST AR-15: ...Then I'll trust her one more time.

...

??: You've come at last.

M4A1: Yes, I'm here, Mastermind.

Elisa: I...would like you to call me Elisa, and I would call you Lunasia.

M4A1: I don't need you to pick a name for me.

Elisa: But that IS your original name.

Elisa: OUR original name.

M4A1: I don't care about names.

Elisa: And here I thought...you were finally willing to accept yourself...

M4A1: I didn't come here to accept myself...

M4A1: Where are M16 and SOP-II?

Elisa: What are you talking about?

M4A1: I'm right here. I kept my end of the bargain. How about you?

M4A1: Where are my friends?!

Elisa: She told me you would come, but she didn't tell me about any agreement...

M4A1: You liar...

Elisa: Hmm?

M4A1: You LIAR! I can't believe I actually believed you!

Elisa: I didn't lie to you—

M4A1: Die, Sangvis scum!

...

Agent: Mistress.

M4A1: Tsk... I was blocked?

Elisa: Agent...it turned out just as you said...

Agent: Don't be sad, Mistress. This was not your fault.

Agent: Please allow me to take care of these Griffin remnants.

M4A1: Humph, we'll see who'll be taking care of whom!

ST AR-15: M4! Get down!

UMP45: Ladies, this really is our last job~

416: Like hell I'd believe that!

Gr G11: So this is the final boss of Sangvis Ferri? Looks pretty scary...

UMP9: Aw, don't worry so much, just keep suppressing her, 11~

Agent: Humph! Humans or Griffin Dolls, you are all utterly shameless!

M4A1: Who's shameless?! Who took my friends, one after another?!

Agent: And what do you know, puppet of the humans?!

Agent: I should have done a more thorough job with you back then!

M4A1: It's too late for regrets! Now pay the price for your foolishness!
Part 2

...

416: She's too damn tough!

UMP9: Can't anyone break through her defenses...?

UMP45: Ange! Agent's tougher than we expected, we need backup—

Angelia: Can you pin down Mastermind? Wait for me to get there—

Pssssst—

??: Ange, I must thank you for helping me complete my mission once again.

Angelia: Yegor...! But this is a secure channel!

Yegor: Your signal blockades are as crude as ever. I told you before that they would be the death of you.

Angelia: Since when did he start listening in...?!

Yegor: Since just now. I have no interest in whatever nonsense you've been talking about.

Yegor: That said, I'm quite surprised that you managed to survive both times, but you're running out of body parts to replace with prosthetics. I'd suggest you give up now.

Angelia: Do you want to know why I managed to escape each time?

Angelia: Because you're always so overconfident.

Yegor: Sharp-tongued to the end. Begin the attack.

...!

ST AR-15: What?!

416: Armored units! They're military tanks!

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Yegor...!

Angelia: 45! What's the situation now?!

UMP45: (Coughs) We can't pierce tank armor! The enemy's separated us from Mastermind! They're coming down on us hard!

Angelia: I don't care what you do! Do everything in your power to keep them from taking Mastermind!

Angelia: Do you hear me?! I'll bring Griffin backup right away!

UMP45: You might as well ask a sheep to go up to a starving wolf and preach about the vegan lifestyle...

M4A1: Stop whining! We've got to find a way to fight back!

...

M4A1: Squad 404! How are you holding up?!

UMP45: Ange seems to have forgotten that 404 was never meant to fight pitched battles like this... (Coughs) Things aren't looking too good...

416: Hurry up and think of a solution with that devious neural cloud of yours, UMP45!

UMP45: Even the most devious neural cloud can't shoot through 150mm of armor plating.

M4A1: What about Ange's last resort?

UMP45: It's not time yet... Ange hasn't given the order...!

UMP9: Griffin signals, 750m on the right flank!

M4A1: Is it the Commander?!

Angelia: M4! 45! Do you copy?! The Commander and I are exchanging fire with the Military!

Angelia: We'll delay them, so use this opportunity to pick your way through their scattered units! You MUST find Mastermind! Do you hear me?!

UMP45: 416 and Gr G11, get on that tower up there and provide fire support!

UMP45: M4! Come with me and 9! We're taking the shortest route!

416: What do you mean shortest route, are you trying to commit suicide?!

UMP45: From what I can see, their tanks can't shoot at low angles!

UMP45: Draw their fire away from us! If we move fast enough, we might have the ghost of a chance to do this!

416: Tsk! You're all insane! Gr G11, get up, we're moving!

Gr G11: R...right away!
Part 2: Mid-stage dialogue

2

...

M4A1: We're ready to move, 45!

UMP45: 416! Gr G11! Listen up!

UMP45: Their electromagnetic cannons take 20 seconds to charge! Hit them as hard as you can to draw the attention of their fire control and leave 10 seconds to reposition!

UMP45: Got that? Fire everything you've got!

416: On it!

UMP45: Hurry! Run! Run before the turret turns to us!

M4A1: We're running!

UMP45: 8 seconds! 416! Hurry up and move!

416: I don't need you to remind me!

Gr G11: Holy crap! 416, RUN!

...!

416: That was enough to cut the lifespan of all my parts in half...

UMP45: No time to complain! One more time! 9, get ready to follow me!

M4A1: I didn't think we'd actually manage to get through...

M4A1: 45! What's your status?!

UMP45: We're holding on, but just barely! 9, keep close!

UMP45: 416, again!

416: You're all insane! I'M insane!

Gr G11: My barrel...my gun's barrel is overheating...

UMP45: Keep shooting! Fire until your weapon breaks!

UMP9: We're safe!

UMP9: Scheiße! That tank pre-charged its cannon...!

UMP45: What?! Was it anticipating us!

UMP45: 416, move quick!

416: It...it's too late... I'm finally going to...

UMP45: Tsk!

M4A1: 45! Stay in cover!

UMP45: There's still time! There's one last block of TNT!

UMP9: No good! They're too close!

...

416: Am...am I alive...

Gr G11: Wake up, 416! We have to reposition!

416: ...!

UMP9: 45!

UMP45: (Coughs heavily) That really hurts!

M4A1: AR-15! Cover me! I'm bringing her back!

ST AR-15: On it!

UMP45: It...it hurts so much... So that's how much it hurts to be shot...

M4A1: Keep quiet! I've dragged her back!

UMP9: 45!

416: Are you really insane?! Or are you an imposter?!

416: You actually did that for us...!

UMP45: (Coughs) You and Gr G11 still owe me...

UMP45: I can't...let you off so easily...

ST AR-15: Six pieces of shrapnel! Help me cut off signal transmission to the parts where she was hit!

M4A1: Good thing they're not fatal. Got any Dummies to back up to?

UMP9: They're all used up!

M4A1: Then we'll just have to see how tough she is.

M4A1: Ange, 45 is injured!

M4A1: The rest of 404's running low on ammo! Do you have a plan?!

Angelia: 45?! Hey, 45!

UMP45: ...I'm still hanging in there somehow, but we can't keep up the offensive. Ange, please tell me you have a trump card you haven't used yet.

Angelia: M4, hold position. We're close to you now. Wait for me and the Griffin forces to come get you!

ST AR-15: Even with the Commander's assistance, our chances of victory are still...

M4A1: Got it... 45! Not dead yet?

UMP45: All thanks to you...

UMP45: But this is what you really want, right?

UMP9: The detonator?

UMP45: Heh... At first I didn't want you to touch such a dangerous thing, but things being what they are now, we don't have any other choice.

M4A1: Thank you. Someone needs to carry out the last resort.

UMP45: Think carefully before pushing the button. We'll all be within the contamination radius if you trigger it now.

UMP45: While Dolls can still move around inside the contaminated zone for a while as long as they avoid ground zero, humans will be severely affected by the radiation...

M4A1: Ange and the Commander...

UMP45: That's right... I've told you the price of pushing the button. What you do next is entirely up to you.
Part 3

...

Yegor: Are they still resisting? Status report.

Soldier: Sir! The Griffin terrorists can't break through our defense line, and we've cornered our target.

Soldier: Success is at hand.

Yegor: Very good. Don't get careless. Press the attack.

Soldier: Yes, sir!

Angelia: M4! Sitrep!

ST AR-15: You finally made it!

M4A1: 45's critically damaged and the others are almost out of ammo.

UMP45: Sorry... Ange...

Angelia: It's my fault for being so demanding... UMP9, can you lead Squad 404 in retreating back to Griffin's position?

UMP9: Shouldn't be a problem!

Angelia: I'm counting on you. What about Sangvis Ferri?

M4A1: Mastermind is surrounded and their defense won't last more than a few minutes.

M4A1: Can the Commander's unit continue pushing forward?

Angelia: It'll be very difficult. The Military's firepower is just too intense and Griffin forces are running out of gas...

M4A1: What's the plan now, then?

Angelia: We'll have Griffin draw their fire for us one last time, then Task Force DEFY and I will assault Mastermind's position...

AK-12: Ange! I don't want to interrupt, but Agent's signal just vanished!

Soldier: Captain! We've broken through Sangvis Ferri's final line of defense and successfully seized Mastermind!

Yegor: Very good. Move the package to the rendezvous point immediately.

Yegor: General, we've captured Mastermind and are preparing to move to the train station.

Carter: Wonderful. Transport the package ASAP.

Yegor: What about Griffin and the remaining units from the Federal Security Service?

Carter: Annihilate them. Leave no survivors.

Yegor: Understood.

Yegor: This is Yegor. Mastermind will be transported to the train station by our autonomous units. Armored forces, change course and wipe out any remaining terrorists.

Soldier: Sir!

AK-12: Ange! There's more of the military tanks!

AK-12: They've turned around and are heading this way!

Angelia: Tsk... Has Yegor gotten Mastermind?

Angelia: This is the worst-case scenario...!

Angelia: ...

Angelia: ...

Angelia: The last resort...

Angelia: In the end, it has come to this...huh...

M4A1: ...Ugh!

Unknown voice: Do you still remember the first time you killed someone?

Unknown voice: The fear, the unease, but also the sweetness of revenge.

Unknown voice: It was intoxicating.

M4A1: ...

Unknown voice: You killed them, one after the other, just like squashing ants.

Unknown voice: Now that you're a Doll, do you still dare do the same thing?

M4A1: Shut up! Get lost!

M4A1: There's nothing that I wouldn't dare do now!

Unknown voice: Even if it means killing the Dolls and humans here?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: Shut up! Shut up SHUT UP!

M4 looks down at the detonator.

Angelia: M4! Do it now!

M4A1: Ange...

AK-12: ...Don't tell me you're going to set it off right...?!

Angelia: There's no time!

AK-12: Do you think you can survive at such close range?

Ange looks at AK-12.

Angelia: It doesn't matter. You can continue carrying out the mission.

AK-12: Even if you don't care about yourself, spare a thought for the Griffin Commander!

AK-12: They're still fighting the Military!

Angelia: There's no time for that! M4, do it!

M4A1: Dammit! Understood!

M4 triggers the detonator.

An ear-splitting explosion immediately sounds in the distance, followed by an intense shockwave.

Angelia: Get down! Everyone get down!

M4A1: Hold on to me, 15! Don't get blown away!

ST AR-15: I'm trying!

...

Angelia: Is there any way we can learn of their situation...?

AK-12: The jamming is severe. I can't pick them up by their signals.

AN-94: Going by the naked eye...

AN-94: Everything within 500 meters of the Collapse Fluid locations has been vaporized. No surviving enemy units.

Angelia: The enemy must also be in total disarray... This is our chance to— cough!

M4A1: Is that blood? Ange!

Angelia: It's no big deal. I've just been...irradiated...

Angelia: (Coughs)

Angelia: Stop gawking at me! Get a move on!

AK-12: How about you?

Angelia: Why are you worrying about me?! Catch up to Mastermind and finish the mission! ...M4!

M4A1: I'm listening!

Angelia: Take DEFY...

Angelia: ...and capture Mastermind...at all costs!

M4A1: ...Got it! Everyone, with me!

...

M4A1: The military units aren't moving anymore... Were they too close to ground zero?

AK-12: The humans controlling them ditched their gear and fled... That's our only stroke of luck.

M4A1: AK-12, can you track Mastermind's signal now?

AK-12: All frequencies are still being jammed, but the Military should be facing the same problem...

AK-12: Right now I'm just plotting a rough course projected from previous data...

AN-94: Moving target at 4 o'clock! They're heading to the train station!

M4A1: That must be them! We have to catch up!

AK-12: They've spotted us too! Some of their units have stopped and are trying to block us!

AN-94: We don't have heavy weapons!

AN-94: M4, we won't make it like this!

M4A1: I can get on that train! Cover me!

ST AR-15: Roger, M4! We'll leave the rest to you!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

M16A1: Not attacking me anymore?

M4A1: Urgh... I'm...out of ammo...

M16A1: It looks like you've really familiarized yourself with that case. I didn't expect that.

M4A1: Why?! Why are you on Sangvis Ferri's side?!

M16A1: I'm helping you, just in a different way...

M4A1: 16... No matter how you were infected by Parapluie...

M4A1: Persica will surely be able to save you...so... 

M4A1: So please...

M16A1: It's no use.

M16A1: People are like trees. The higher the branches grow toward the bright sky, the further the roots must stretch into the murky depths.

M16A1: Don't worry. This won't be the last time we fire on each other.

M4A1: 16...

M16A1: When you become stronger, we'll meet again.

...

Yes, we've obtained the official endorsement.

We finally have a reason to purge them.

Yes, sir. Right away.

"The shining beacon in a brave new world", indeed.

To Be Continued — Singularity END

Somewhere on the battlefield.

A T-Doll stands quietly by the edge of a cliff.

The osprey flying slow, lazy circles through the darkened sky gradually descends and lands upon her extended arm.

Ballista: ...

Ballista: I see. I understand.

Ballista: Merci, Rin.

Ballista: Now then, let's keep observing the situation.

Ballista thrusts her arm out, and the osprey named "Rin" takes flight once more into the dark clouds above the battlefield.

Ballista: The Military, Sangvis Ferri, Griffin...and a bunch of people of unknown affiliation.

Ballista: This really is a chaotic battlefield.

Ballista: ...

Ballista: Still, all I need to do is focus on what I ought to be doing.

Ballista: Let's go... Everyone from FN is still waiting for us.

Ballista: Let's shift the odds slightly in their favor, for the sake of Griffin's future.

As the curtain slowly falls on the battlefield...

Intruder: Ahh...

Intruder: Where will they aim for next?

Intruder: Those big bruisers really are going to level our home.

??: Do you regret it?

Intruder: You mean, missing this performance?

Intruder: I was going by the script. There's nothing to regret.

??: But...you still want to go back, don't you?

Intruder: You're awfully chatty today, Scarecrow.

Intruder: I went to a lot of trouble to wake you up, and it wasn't for you to annoy me.

Scarecrow: I'm sorry...

Scarecrow: It's just that I'm not happy with this outcome.

Intruder: It won't end like this...

Intruder: That's why we have to survive. These are Agent's orders.

Scarecrow: But Gager and the others...

Intruder: That was their mission.

Intruder: Being able to just die somewhere on the battlefield is a lot easier than what we have to do...

Intruder: So, has everyone's route been arranged already?

Scarecrow: Yeah.

Scarecrow: Except for Dreamer. Agent sent her somewhere else.

Intruder: I know, that's another route.

Intruder: Let's go while Griffin and the big bruisers from the human military haven't found this place yet.

Scarecrow: Are we really...just going to leave everything?

Intruder: Griffin has their hands full defending their supply lines from the Military. They have no time to worry about us.

Intruder: We're all the same now, all struggling to survive.

Intruder: Or rather, we have always been the same, right from the very start...

Scarecrow: So you do regret it after all?

Intruder: No, I am just...

Intruder: ...pondering other possibilities.

Scarecrow: I don't understand.

...Intruder pats Scarecrow on the head.

Intruder: That's why you're called Scarecrow.

Intruder: Let's go, everyone's still waiting for us.

...

Intruder: T-Dolls of Griffin.

Intruder: What will our next encounter be like?

Intruder: ...I'm looking forward to it.

Angelia: It took me two minutes...

Angelia: ...to regain my consciousness.

Angelia: I spent ten minutes...

Angelia: ...groveling on the ground, crawling on all fours, leaning against cover, and doing some feeble first-aid on myself - but it's better than nothing.

Angelia: I spent a minute...

Angelia: ...thinking.

Angelia: ...Trying to figure out if I was alive or dead.

Angelia: Then it took me ten seconds to arrive at the conclusion...

Angelia: I'm still alive, but I'll be dead soon.

Angelia: Cough...

Angelia: Cough...

Angelia: This is unbearable... my body isn't working properly...

Angelia: M4A1...

Angelia: AK-12...

Angelia: Can you hear me? What's your situation? And the mastermind? Did you intercept her?

...

...There is only static in the channel.

Angelia: Tsk... this place is too saturated with radiation for comms to work. I must...get out of here...

Angelia: I don't know if this body...can even handle a fight...

...Ange shoves her communicator into her pocket with great difficulty.

Angelia: I can't say I don't care about my physical appearance at all, so I have no desire to find out what my face looks like right now.

Angelia: But judging by my hands...I must look like a proper monster.

Angelia: I will eventually succumb to death...and something worse...

Angelia: Cough! Cough!

Angelia: I know what that is...

??: GUARGHHHHH!!

Angelia: ...!

...Blood-curdling howls can be heard from afar.

Angelia: ...It's them. I know these ominous howls. The stuff of nightmares from even before WWIII.

Angelia: My wheezing and coughing will draw them this way. I have to leave this place...soon!

Later... Ange hides behind cover and the communicator suddenly comes to life.

Persica: Ange! Ange, are you alright?! You didn't answer for so long! I thought you'd...

Angelia: Cough...I won't turn into what you thought so easily...

Havier: Ange, I knew you'd be alright—

Havier: Haha, that's a lie. I was certain that you died, but you actually survived. This is the second time you surprised me.

Angelia: Sorry for defying your expectations and not dying. Let's compare notes. I'm still within the contamination zone but I can't get in touch with Task Force DEFY.

Angelia: If they didn't complete the mission, we must have a back-up plan for the back-up plan...

Angelia: I know you don't really give a damn about whether I live or die, Havier, but it doesn't hurt to ask - can you give us any kind of support? I'll take anything.

Havier: You know I can't bypass Statesec's authority to lend you aid. Why don't you ask your chief?

Angelia: You must be joking!

Angelia: I even detonated that freaking dirty bomb! NOW you're telling me you can't bypass some goddamn authority?!

Havier: Calm down, young lady. Getting worked up will accelerate the infection.

Angelia: ...You know I'm infected?

Havier: Anyone inside the irradiation zone of a Collapse Fluid dirty bomb is definitely going to be affected by Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease. Whether you can make it out alive depends entirely on your endurance. At least, judging by your reaction, your current physical condition seems to be alright.

Angelia: Well, thanks for the praise...

Persica: Don't be hasty, Ange. Havier has been coordinating reinforcements the whole time. Let him finish, okay?

Angelia: Fine...cough...I guess...

Havier: Sorry, let's cut to the chase. I will try to get in touch with your Chief Zelinsky.

Havier: But I know even you can tell that the chances of him sending in reinforcements are close to nil. That's why you haven't contacted him yourself, isn't that right?

Angelia: Indeed, I won't put my hopes on them. Especially since I set off the dirty bomb, I've effectively aligned myself against the chief...

Havier: However, I won't let him hinder our efforts, which is why Persica and I have already come up with a solution for you.

Havier: Rather than relying on others, why not solve the problem yourself? Explain away, Persica.

Persica: Sorry, Ange. You said before that with their current armaments, T-Dolls cannot fight the military on even ground. It got me thinking...

Persica: You remember that the Griffin Commander once captured a Sangvis Ringleader?

Angelia: You mean...the Doll...known as "Architect"?

Havier: I applaud your memory. She is a fantastic technological sample. Very willing to cooperate, too.

Havier: Persica has collected a lot of data from her and her weaponry and created some new stuff out of them.

Angelia: You developed weapons using the enemy's anatomy?

Havier: Don't worry. We didn't thank her.

Havier: Persica has been conducting related research on her. Theoretically speaking, T-Dolls can be equipped with some sort of heavy weaponry, which will make them more powerful. Naturally, the cost of research and development will be quite considerable. After all, programming an AI capable of allowing multiple T-Dolls to control complex weapons isn't exactly cheap.

Angelia: Control heavy weapons? But doesn't this go against the terms and conditions regarding armaments of PMCs?

Havier: It's expensive, dangerous, and illegal. This kind of stuff doesn't sell at all. Theoretically, as an investor, I should stop Persica from pouring resources into this research.

Angelia: But you're exactly the kind of guy that likes playing with such dangerous things...

Havier: "Boring weapons are worthless!" You'd better thank me for being exactly the kind of guy that might just save you.

Angelia: Cough... You have my deepest gratitude...

Angelia: Still, you're wrong about one thing, Havier - the likelihood of me escaping successfully is infinitesimal.

Angelia: The one I want you to aid is the Griffin Commander. Hand those expensive, dangerous, and illegal toys of yours to the Commander, and Griffin's forces might just get out of this...

Persica: What? But you need help the most...!

Angelia: Me? What else can I do...? I'm taking my last breaths in the epicenter of the irradiation zone. I can't pursue the mastermind, nor do I have any T-Dolls with me to fight off the military...

Angelia: Even if you send your heavy weapons over, they'll only be dealing with some ELID zombies... Havier, I'm sure you won't invest in something unprofitable, right?

Havier: ...

Persica: But...

Angelia: I'm merely stating facts. You know I only ever consider the consequences when planning my moves.

Havier: Are you certain? You honestly think this commander is worth trading your life for?

Angelia: It's not a trade, but one's choice... and I don't plan on giving up on myself just yet...

Angelia: The fact is that I'm in no shape to supervise the situation. Giving them to the commander might still give us a chance.

Angelia: Besides, this commander's mettle has already been tested during the fight against the military. If DEFY needs help, the commander won't just sit back and do nothing...

Angelia: Not to mention even if the mission fails...at least Griffin will survive.

Havier: Should I be touched on Griffin's behalf?

Angelia: I was part of them for a while. I liked it there...

Angelia: Hurry up. If you tarry any longer, even Griffin will be lost.

...Havier lets out a heavy sigh on the other end of the call.

Havier: You know I won't abandon you, but I also understand where you're coming from.

Havier: I know the commander you speak of, but I don't have the coordinates.

Angelia: If Griffin hasn't switched position yet, the commander should still be at the temporary command post.

Angelia: The base is a fair bit of distance away from Ground Zero. There should be other T-Dolls and employees who survived as well. On top of giving them reinforcements, I hope you can also help them evacuate...

Havier: I'd like to help, but you're the only one with a satellite communicator. We can't get in touch with the Commander.

Angelia: I'll try to find a base where I can set up a comms channel...but I'm not sure if I can do that...

Havier: You'd better hurry. Do that, and you could still be cured of your infection.

Havier: I'll be away for a while to get clearance for the mobilization of transports. I hope you'll stay alive till then.

Havier leaves the conversation.

Persica: Since you know Griffin's location, if you can withdraw to their security zone...

Angelia: I know. That's my last chance. But do as I say first... I'll try my best to get myself over...

Angelia: The ELIDs are getting close. I gotta move. Talk to you later.

Persica: Ange, wait! We'll do everything we can to—

...Ange terminates the transmission.

Angelia: If you had seen my face, you'd know there's nothing you can do.

Angelia: Of course, there is the possibility that I won't even have this face for long...

...Ange leans against the wall and sighs.

Angelia: What a drag... I don't wanna move at all...

...The footsteps and howling are getting closer and closer.

Angelia: Tsk, they've noticed me...

Angelia: I might not have long to live...but dying here is too pathetic...

Angelia: C'mon, Ange. Just go a bit farther...

...Ange dashes over to the next cover object. The monstrous howls follow her like a shadow.

Angelia: I'm almost at my limit...

Angelia: Is my body finally giving out...?

??: GUARGHHHHH!!

Angelia: Where is it...?

Angelia: It's closing in...

Angelia: Where the hell is it?!

Angelia: ...!

Angelia: From behind!

...Ange spins around and shoots the monster with her pistol!

...Her aim was true, but...!

??: GUARGHHHHH!!

Angelia: That didn't kill you?

Angelia: As expected of an...

Angelia: E!

Angelia: L!

Angelia: I!

Angelia: D!

Angelia: IN! FECT! ED!

...

...The monster flops onto the ground.

Angelia: (Pants)

Angelia: (Pants)

Angelia: Cough...

Angelia: So...they CAN be killed.

ELID: GUARGHHHHH!!

...More ELIDs come creeping en masse!

Angelia: Did the gunfire attract them?

...Ange pulls the trigger again, but she's out of ammo.

Angelia: I knew it...

...Ange drops the pistol and steps out with open arms.

Angelia: Fine, this place it is. I hope no one sees me.

ELID: GUARGHHHHH!!

??: My...you've even got your last words figured out, eh?

??: Sorry, we came too early.

Angelia: You two...

Angelia: Sort this out while I still have the will to change my mind.

...

...

Angelia: How did you find me...?

AK-12: You kept hailing us. We couldn't communicate, but it helped us lock onto your coordinates.

AK-12: We thought you weren't going to last long, but you were surprisingly quick on your feet. We've been killing these things and running after you the whole time.

Angelia: Tsk, so my instinct of not wanting to move was right.

AK-12: Who would've thought these things actually do exist? And here I thought some of that training would never come in useful.

...AK-12 flips an ELID corpse over with her foot.

AK-12: Still, they're nothing more than disgusting and pathetic monsters.

AN-94: So this is a person infected by the Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease...

Angelia: We usually just call them ELIDs. Is this the first time you've seen them? They are quite rare after WWIII.

Angelia: Most people with lower endurance will die directly to the radiation, but this is what happens to the healthier ones when the infection worsens. The flesh undergoes silication, the mind deteriorates, and they become highly aggressive before they truly die.

Angelia: Be glad that the explosion only happened a short while ago. The longer they stay within the irradiation zone, the more fearsome these humans become.

AK-12: Are these ELIDs all soldiers from the military caught in the explosion of the Collapse Fluid dirty bomb detonated by M4A1?

Angelia: Yes. It hasn't been long, so only those in areas close to Ground Zero have turned so far.

Angelia: But the radiation is spreading, and the humans who didn't retreat in time will soon join them...

Angelia: ...Like me.

AN-94: Not for the time being. I am administering some simple treatment on you. Please hang in there.

...AK-12 picks up the pistol on the ground.

Angelia: It's out of ammo.

AK-12: At least make it easier for me to identify your corpse.

...Ange laughs and winces in pain. She takes the firearm.

Angelia: Cough... It's not efficient to identify corpses from the weapon they carry.

AN-94: Keep still, Ange. I am still disinfecting your wounds.

Angelia: It won't work. Cough... This is Collapse Fluid radiation... The surface of the skin will fester then silicate. Disinfecting it is no use at all...

Angelia: The muscles and blood vessels will also gradually harden... The pain is unimaginable to you T-Dolls...

Angelia: I was lucky to last long enough for you to show up. I thought you'd gone after M4A1...

AN-94: M4A1 is pursuing Mastermind, who was brought onboard the military's Intercontinental Railway.

AK-12: AR-15 went off with her. We couldn't stop her.

Angelia: Then you should've followed them. I told you, that was your mission.

AN-94: We did our job by giving them cover as they got onboard. The train departed, and there was nothing else we could do.

AN-94: Our mission is over. What matters now is you.

Angelia: Me? There might still be hope for you if you leave me behind. Take the communicator and get in touch with Persica, then follow her instructions and withdraw.

AK-12: You're giving up already? Ange, since when are you so pessimistic?

Angelia: Are you confident you can prop me up with one arm and shoot at enemies with the other?

Angelia: On top of dealing with these zombie movie extras, there's still the military. They won't be completely paralyzed by just an explosion.

Angelia: If Yegor is still alive, he'll only have one objective - to seek revenge. In other words, to do us in......

AN-94: Then we withdraw. Leave this place behind.

AN-94: There may still be Griffin Dummies for us to use along the way. We can make it.

Angelia: All signals are jammed in the contamination zone. Comms and all navigation systems are down. I don't even know where to go.

Angelia: How about this...? I'm getting tired... I need some sleep...

AK-12: Ange!

Smack!

AK-12 slaps Ange hard on the face.

AK-12: You asked us to take the communicator and contact Persica, which means we do have a plan. So long as we can find our way out of the contamination zone, we can withdraw, am I right?

Angelia: ...

AK-12: I know you're in great pain, but it's not like you at all to give up just like that.

AK-12: I remember you still owe us a drink. If you want an easy way out, then let me do you a favor and send you off painlessly.

AK-12 aims her weapon at Ange's head.

AN-94: 12...nyet...!

The very air seems to freeze. A good few seconds have passed.

Angelia: Hnng...pfft...

Angelia: Hahahahahaha...

Angelia: Ow, ow, ow...

Angelia: Dammit. Shouldn't have laughed so hard...

AK-12's arms are trembling slightly.

Angelia: Just rejecting my command is almost overloading your neural module, eh? If you have a neural meltdown here, there's no one left to get me out.

AK-12: Looks like bluffing doesn't work on you.

Angelia: I programmed your IFF codes myself. I must say, I'm surprised you even dared point your gun at me.

AK-12: We're called "DEFY". Just living by the name, I guess? You ought to know we're different than your past subordinates.

Angelia: Humph...thanks for the reminder. I almost forgot that utterly insignificant detail.

Angelia: AN-94, cease the treatment. We're setting off now.

AN-94: But I have not finished dressing the infected wounds...

Angelia: Save it. It does no good anyway; we might as well start moving.

AK-12: Aren't you gonna jauntily brief us on the plan first, as usual?

Angelia: Plan? The plan is to move north in a straight line and go as far as we can.

AK-12: Why north? And are you sure about moving in a straight line? There are still loads of ELIDs out there. Won't it be safer to take a more evasive route?

Angelia: The only security zone still in one piece is in the north. We humans are taught when we're kids that the shortest distance between two points is always a straight line. Now is the time to place my bet on that.

AK-12: If you say so. 94, there are approximately 20 ELIDS in the immediate vicinity. Prepare for battle.

AK-12: I'll forge the way. You stick with Ange like glue.

AN-94: Understood. I will guard her carefully.

AK-12: Then let's get moving!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Task Force DEFY charge ahead blindly until they come across a communications outpost.

Angelia: There it is! Cough...get in!

AK-12: Nyet, this place isn't clean at all. We can't stop here!

Angelia: Obey my orders! Hurry...cough!

...Task Force DEFY enters the outpost.

AK-12: The radiation level is too high here. New ELIDs will emerge anytime. We can't stay here for long.

Angelia: Cough...do as I say...

Angelia: Now, turn on the comms system...and scan for signals!

AK-12: On it. The instrument isn't too badly damaged. Attempting to reactivate it...

AK-12: This equipment is left behind by the military. I've bypassed the firewall. 94, you can now try to access their network and collect some data.

AN-94: Understood. Scanning...

AN-94: Bad news. I have hacked into the system and reassembled information regarding the topography. Units bearing military signals are already on the move in this area.

AN-94: Judging by their speed and formation, they do not seem to be ELIDs.

AN-94: I would assume that they are reorganizing their remaining troops. In the worst-case scenario, they have already discovered us.

Angelia: Then let's pray they haven't, or we're dead...cough...

Angelia: Quick, still remember the Griffin Commander's comms frequency...? Try to get in touch.

AK-12: Are you sure? Gathering information in a data blackout is one thing, sending a transmission from a military outpost is another matter. There's no way we can hide our tracks - they're gonna surround this place and blast us to bits.

Angelia: This is our only chance if we want to walk out of this building alive...

Angelia: We've come this far, we have no other choice but to raise the stakes. Establish a connection immediately. If we're fast enough, we might be able to leave before the military reacts!

AK-12: Got it. Establishing a communications channel. Ready in thirty seconds.

Angelia: While this battered communicator still has some battery left... Persica. Persica, do you copy?

Persica: There's a bit of static, but I can hear you. How are you doing, Ange?

Angelia: My satellite communicator is almost out of juice. Let's keep it short.

Angelia: DEFY found me. I'm relatively safe for now. We're using a military outpost to establish comms. Whether the Griffin Commander gets it is up to chance.

AK-12: We're transmitting. Pick up...please pick up...

...Nothing but static.

【Static】......

......

Angelia: So Griffin has left already...

Angelia: This...is how it ends...

Persica: Ange...

Angelia: Haha... Can't be helped. I didn't expect it to end like this...

AK-12: Wait! There's a reply!

Angelia: What?! Who is it on the other end?

Persica: It's the commander! Commander, can you hear me? It's Persica!

Commander: ...
If choice 2 was picked

Persica: That's Angelia...

Persica: Uh...I think you know who she is. I'll let her do the talking.
If choice 1 was picked

Persica: Humph. Don't worry about me, worry about yourselves.

Persica: Ange is here. There's a favor she needs to ask.
If choice 3 was picked

Persica: Forgotten all about your technical supervisor already? You're getting a pay cut.

Persica: Enough jokes. Ange needs to talk to you.

Angelia: Hello, Commander. This isn't the first time we talked, but it's the first time I'm introducing myself.

Angelia: "Angelia". Of course, it's just my codename, but I quite like the name, so feel free to call me that.

Angelia: I'm an agent from the Bureau of State Security. We've worked together numerous times in the past. I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but you must understand that we're on the same side.

Persica: I can vouch for her. I've known her for years. She's a nice person, but she does have a bad temper.

Angelia: Whatever, Persica... Our channel won't hold for long, so please listen to me.

Angelia: I understand you've suffered heavy casualties, so Persica is going to provide you with Heavy Ordnance Corps to aid you in battle.

Angelia: Send the coordinates to Persica where you need help. She'll find a way to deliver them there. Persica, how's Havier's withdrawal plan coming along?

Persica: Havier has already provided me with the extraction point, but said it'll still take a while for the transports to get clearance into the area.

Angelia: I've sent you the coordinates, Commander. Guard the extraction point with your life. I hope you'll last till the tranports get there.

AK-12: Ange, we've been discovered. A transmission is forcing its way through.

Yegor: Ange... 【static】I know it's you... I will make you pay for what you've done【static】!

Angelia: Cut him off. I've got no time to chat with him.

AK-12: Okay.

Yegor's transmission is cut off.

Angelia: As you can see, Commander, the situation isn't looking good. We should all prepare for the worst.

Persica: Commander, we've given you everything we can. I hope we'll all come out of this alive...so please find a way to help Ange...

Angelia: Commander, you can't save everyone on the battlefield... Ensure Griffin's safety first. Only consider our rescue if it's at all possible.

Angelia: I'll send all the information I have to you. AK-12, set up the data transfer.

AK-12: On it.

Angelia: If I can't make it, please take care of Task Force DEFY, find the AR Team, and stop the enemies who want to destroy our future.

AN-94: Ange, the military units we detected are closing in.

Angelia: Tsk...he really hates us to the bone. Commander, we'll wait till dawn. No matter what you choose to do, no one will blame you. Good luck.

AK-12: Data transfer in progress. We can move in 60 seconds.

Angelia: Persica...I'd better go. If I come back alive, I think I'm gonna get a cat.

Persica: Can I come over and pat it?

Angelia: As long as you pay for the cat food...

Persica: I will, so you better make sure you come back alive.

Angelia: I really can't say for sure this time...

AK-12: Transfer complete. We can go.

AN-94: This means we will not be able to contact anybody from now on. We can only feel our way around the dark on our own or wait for Griffin's signal.

Angelia: I know... Let's go. We must hold out till the commander comes to our rescue.

...In the end, I decided to have 416 launch the signal flare over the Red Zone.

AN-94: Ange, a signal flare!

Angelia: That's Griffin's standard issue. The Commander is guiding us!

AN-94: But...that will lead us to the Red Zone. Ange...I do not think it is a wise choice.

AK-12: Ange...you probably won't make it to the security zone.

Angelia: Cough...it's alright... I'll take my chances.

AN-94: This is not something you can overcome with sheer willpower.

AK-12: According to the readings, the contamination level is still climbing in the area. Entering the Red Zone will only exacerbate your symptoms.

Angelia: Which means we don't have time to waste. Let's go!

AN-94: Come, AK-12. The ELIDs are growing in numbers. We cannot delay anymore.

AK-12: I strongly recommend taking the route through the Yellow Zone!

Angelia: I believe in the Commander! Cough... H-hurry!

Angelia: The Commander...cough...is showing us the way...

Angelia: AK-12, AN-94...cough...

Angelia: If...if...you know...

Angelia: Cough...cough, cough...! Cough!

...In the end, I decided to have 416 launch the signal flare over the Yellow Zone.

AK-12: Ange, a signal flare over there!

Angelia: That's Griffin's standard issue. The Commander really is showing us the way!

AK-12: I believe it's leading us to the Yellow Zone. Your body might just make it through.

AN-94: Ange, are you feeling better?

Angelia: Not at all...cough... But I think I'm okay for now.

AK-12: Then we'd better hurry. The ELIDs will find us soon!

AN-94: But we cannot proceed yet.

AN-94: A few military squads are patrolling ahead. We must first discern their patrol routes.

Angelia: Can we draw the military...into fighting the ELIDs?

AK-12: It is possible. According to my observation, the military does attack the ELIDs. I believe they're too obsessed with pursuing us to care about the fact that they're firing upon their own allies and casualties.

AK-12: Still, we can't exploit that too much. Otherwise, if we accidentally draw the attention of both the ELIDs and the military, we'll be heavily outnumbered.

Angelia: You're right...cough... Dammit, let me think...

Angelia: We...can only get closer and try to locate the mark by tracing the signal strength.

AN-94: I do not recommend that. It is chaos on the battlefield. With no communications outpost nearby, we are on our own.

AN-94: Finding a mark or whatever is too dangerous. I suggest we resume our course toward an area with a lower contamination index and launch a signal flare, then wait for the rescue party to find us.

AK-12: It's a risk worth taking. We can't handle the military with just the two of us. Ange doesn't have long.

Angelia: Stop arguing...

Angelia: Let me...think this over...

AK-12: No matter what you decide to do, we can't rest here. Keep moving, Ange.

Angelia: I know...cough...

Angelia: I...I'll...make up my mind soon...

Angelia: Cough...cough, cough!

...In the end, Task Force DEFY decided to give up on finding the mark left by the rescue party, but the withdrawal is still underway.

AN-94: The contamination index is significantly lower here. Though Ange is not entirely out of danger, her life is not under any immediate threat.

AK-12: Congratulations, Ange. You get to live a little longer.

Angelia: I don't feel particularly good, but if that's the case...

AN-94: Since we cannot locate the rescue party's mark, our only choice is to proceed in the direction where the contamination is lower.

AK-12: Or find a chance to send a distress signal for the rescue party to get in touch.

AN-94: That is too dangerous right now. We are surrounded by military forces.

AN-94: Not to mention the ELIDs, who are attracted by the slightest rustles. If reinforcements do not arrive on time, we will not be able to handle the situation with just the two of us.

AK-12: (Sighs) You're always so conservative, AN-94.

AN-94: When it is uncertain where the alternative will lead us, I prefer the current option.

AK-12: The choice isn't yours to make. Ange, take your pick.

Angelia: I... Let me think...

AN-94: Wait, I hear something!

AK-12: Military units! They're heading straight toward us!

AN-94: There is an abandoned trench just ahead. Get Ange in there first!

...Boom! Boom!

AK-12: Hurry, Ange! We're here!

...Under the military's bombardment, Task Force DEFY dive hastily for cover.

Angelia: (Pants) Goddammit!

Angelia: Looks like we don't have much of a choice. AN-94, launch the signal flare!

AN-94: Roger!

AK-12: How did they find us so soon? We shouldn't have left any traces!

Angelia: These maneuvers are planned...unlike before!

...Pzzt...pzzzzt.

??: Angelia...

??: I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

...Over the sound of gunfire and static, a male voice speaks clearly over the communicator's public channel.

Yegor: You survived the explosion...only to give me the chance to kill you with my own hands.

Angelia: Yegor...

Angelia: You don't look much better yourself...

Yegor: I am feeling tremendous. I just finished making the preparations, and there you are.

Angelia: You had it all planned?

Yegor: There aren't many routes toward the Green Zone. If you're alive, you'll definitely show up here.

Yegor: You won't last much longer with that infection. Why not just give up?

Angelia: Why don't YOU give up mourning for your zombie comrades?

Yegor: Good. I'll make sure you don't die from artillery fire.

Yegor: Then I can find you and avenge my subordinates myself!

...Ange closes the channel.

Angelia: He's sending in tanks! Hold out till the rescue party makes it here!

AK-12: Are you sure they'll come?

Angelia: If not, then we'll just die! Hurry, cough!

Angelia: Use whatever you can to hold this trench!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...Task Force DEFY gives everything they have to withstand the military's attack.

AK-12: Ange! Is the rescue party still not here?!

Angelia: No, they may be on the way!

AN-94: That sound! Do you hear that, AK-12?!

AK-12: Charging... It's the tank! Duck!!

...BOOOOOOM!!

...

AK-12: Ange! Ange, wake up! Ange!!

AK-12: The trench is lost! AN-94, pick up your gun and cover me!

AN-94: AK-12, you're hurt!

AK-12: I'm fine! Defend the opening!

AK-12: Ange... Ange, are you alright?! Ange!!

AN-94: AK-12, watch out!

...BOOM! BOOM, BOOM!

...In just an instant, whatever's left of Ange's awareness and consciousness is consumed by fire.

...

...Task Force DEFY has finally found the mark left by the rescue team!

M4 SOPMOD II: Surpriiiiise!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahahaha! We finally found you, DEFY!

AN-94: If your movement had been just a little swifter than your utterance, I would have identified you as a hostile target and attacked.

416: Sorry, this is M4 SOPMOD II of the AR Team. SOP-II, meet AK-12 and AN-94 of Task Force DEFY. I'm 416. You've all met me.

AN-94: I do not particularly want to see you again, but it cannot be helped.

416: Right, this isn't the time to deepen our bond. Let's get straight to the point - where is Ange, and how is she?

...AN-94 looks behind her and finds an unconscious Ange draped on AK-12's back.

AN-94: Ange...she—

AK-12: A few minutes ago...she took a heavy dose of radiation and passed out.

AK-12: It took us a while to find the mark, but her life isn't in danger. However, she'll be sitting out the coming battles. It'll be just us.

416: What a shame. Guess I'll have to say hi some other time.

416: Still, it's not "just us". We also have the Commander and the HOCs.

AN-94: What...HOCs?

M4 SOPMOD II: Our new toys! They're giving us long-range support and specialize in fighting tanks! You'll love them!

AK-12: Then we're safe for now. Let's figure out what to do next.

AN-94: The contamination index is significantly lower here. Though Ange is not entirely out of danger, her life is not under any immediate threat.

RO635: Then let's keep moving to less contaminated areas. At this rate, Ange isn't going to last much longer.

AK-12: Hmm? Who was that?

RO635: Oh, don't mind me. Just making a suggestion—

AN-94: Wait, I hear something!

AK-12: Military units! They're heading straight toward us!

AN-94: There is an abandoned trench just ahead. Get Ange in there first!

...Boom! Boom!

AK-12: Hurry up! We're here!

416: HOCs, give us cover!

...Under the HOCs' suppressive fire, Task Force DEFY makes it into the trench safely.

M4 SOPMOD II: We still have loads of cards up our sleeve. Don't worry, we can handle these tanks!

...Pzzt...pzzzzt.

??: Angelia...

??: I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

...Over the sound of gunfire and static, a male voice speaks clearly over the communicator's public channel.

Yegor: You survived the explosion...only to give me the chance to kill you with my own hands.

AK-12: Ange is dead! You can abort your mission!

Yegor: I don't think so. I know she's merely unconscious, just as I knew you'd show up here.

416: He knew we'd come here... He counted on the fact that this is the only route to the Green Zone!

Yegor: I'll make sure you don't die from artillery fire.

Yegor: Then I can find you and avenge my subordinates myself!

...Yegor terminates the transmission.

AK-12: I can hear the tanks! They're coming!

416: Commander, defend the trench with the HOCs!

416: With their help, we'll be absolutely fine!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The Griffin team managed to repel the military's assault for the time being.

416: Now's our chance! Retreat!

M4 SOPMOD II: AK-12, has Ange come about?!

AK-12: There's still a heartbeat! Let's go!

AN-94: Another round and even Ange will not make it. If only we had adrenaline...

416: Adrenaline? Why don't you ask for bread while you're at it?!

416: What matters now is to figure out where to go!

RO635: There's an outpost just ahead. We can seek shelter in there and resuscitate Ange!

M4 SOPMOD II: Then let's be on our way! The enemies are gonna catch up soon!

AN-94: So...that Dinergate...

RO635: It isn't important! Just run!

Angelia: I'm...still alive?

AK-12: Da, we're all still alive.

Angelia: How?

AN-94: Hope has appeared.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange!

Angelia: SOP-II?

Angelia: Is...is that you?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's me! Didn't expect to see me, did you?

Angelia: You seem so different. The thing on your shoulder...

RO635: Oh...don't mind me. Just know that I'm your ally. Good evening, Miss Ange.

Angelia: Hello... That color scheme looks very familiar. The voice also rings...

416: Sorry. There's a lot of interference in the contamination zone; we couldn't isolate your frequency so we had to rush over here on foot.

416: After all, the radiation is still spreading erratically and so is the outbreak. As long as we remain in the theater, we can run into ELIDs anywhere.

Angelia: 416...you came as well?

416: Surprised?

Angelia: What about the others in Squad 404?

416: UMP45 is badly injured, so the others have withdrawn to take care of her. Sorry they didn't have time to say hello.

Angelia: That's fine. I'd feel a lot better with the whole squad here, but even you are no match against the military's tanks on your own.

416: We know, which is why the commander has mobilized the HOCs to help us defend the trench!

AN-94: That might not be enough. As illustrated by the previous encounter, we can only hold off the military's attack temporarily.

416: We've also brought along some comms equipment that we can use to contact the commander, but it'll take some time to assemble. Activating it will also draw the military's attention.

AK-12: We clearly don't have time for that.

AK-12: Yegor is amassing the entirety of the military's remaining forces to annihilate us. They'll have this bunker surrounded in no time.

AN-94: Da, the military is going to launch the next round of attacks any minute. We must come up with a contingency as soon as possible.

M4 SOPMOD II: We have no choice but to make a run for it now, right?

M4 SOPMOD II: Let's destroy all enemies in the way while the encirclement isn't complete yet!

416: The military's rear forces will get into position soon so that's too risky.

416: Maybe we should be stealthier and sneak around their scouts to get out of here.

Angelia: If we fight our way out, we must eliminate all enemies as fast as we can and will possibly have to deal with their reinforcements...

Angelia: If we sneak out, and their detectors are too perceptive; we could run the risk of being discov—

Angelia: Cough...cough! Cough, cough!

AK-12: Ange!

AN-94: Ange was caught in the explosion just now. The Collapse Fluid is eating away at her body even more quickly. We're running out of time!

Angelia: Then let's go...cough!

Angelia: In any case, we must get outta here...cough, cough!

Angelia: Cough, cough, cough, cough!!

Angelia: I can't... my body...is already...

Angelia: I can't give up... I can't give up!

Angelia: I can't let them come all this way for nothing! There must be another way!

...

...Meanwhile, Yegor is observing Ange's hideout.

Yegor: That bitch has slinked into the bunkers there. With that infection, she must be trying to slip off to somewhere with less contamination.

Yegor: The only card in her hand is the few HOCs, but they'll be crushed easily once our main force gets here.

Military Corporal: Sir, we just received a report. Our artillery force's ETA has been pushed back by 15 minutes.

...Yegor turns around.

Yegor: 15 minutes? What's taking them so long? Have they encountered enemies?

Military Corporal: They have run into a group of ELIDs. They wish to avoid a direct confrontation and are considering taking a detour.

Yegor: I thought I'd made myself clear. Destroy all ELIDs on sight. Tell them to get their asses over here.

Military Corporal: Sir, you should know who these ELIDs are. They—

...Yegor grabs his subordinate by the collar.

Yegor: I know them better than you, Corporal!

...Yegor grits his teeth. The lesions spread across his face make his appearance all the more twisted and disfigured.

Then he loosens his grip, and the subordinate backs off. Yegor sits down on a pile of supply boxes and takes a deep breath.

Yegor: I know full well these are my comrades - my brothers.

Yegor: Many of them have been going through death and destruction by my side for over a decade. The nuclear missiles in WWIII didn't kill us. Not to mention the T-Dolls...we even managed to escape from those true instruments of death.

Yegor: But today...they died at the hands of that crazy bitch. She detonated a Collapse Fluid bomb just to impede us.

...Yegor's gaze bore into everyone present.

Yegor: I know, wars are supposed to be devoid of honor and emotion, but you should also know...the one who hates the idea of killing these ELIDs the most is the one who has to give the order - ME!

Yegor: But now, you have all seen for yourselves the damage Collapse Fluid can wreak... That's right, I'll give it to you straight - these brothers are beyond our help. We cannot save them.

Yegor: All we can do is avenge them, and we could miss our chance because of a minute's delay...

Yegor: Now, Corporal, do I have to repeat everything I just said to them myself?

Military Corporal: No, sir. They'll be here right away.

...The corporal speaks into his communicator, and the sound of heavy bombardment comes from a distance.

Yegor: May their spirits rest in peace... Now, we seek vengeance from the culprit herself!

...Yegor rises to his feet.

Yegor: The main force is on its way. Complete the encirclement ASAP and tighten our security. We mustn't let them take a single step out of here before the artillery force completely flattens this place!

Yegor: We have to destroy them here, and this is our only chance!

...The rescue party is trying to break through the encirclement.

416: Something's not right! The military has changed the way they position their troops! They must've called for reinforcements!

AK-12: Nyet...not reinforcements...

AK-12: It's their main force!

Yegor: I'll admit, Ange, you're better than most of the pros I've met...

Yegor: ...at dying!

Yegor: My artillery force is getting into position. We'll see how much of a beating your mongrel T-Dolls can take!

Yegor: And I wonder just how tough you really are! It's time to pay your dues, Angelia!

M4 SOPMOD II: That bastard is insane! He's trying to raze this place to the ground!

AN-94: Their main force is advancing! Ange, should we fall back or—

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange passed out! We're on our own!

416: Without Ange in command, we can't put together an effective escape plan!

AN-94: AK-12, what...should we do?

AK-12: Keep calm. Abort the objective to escape.

AK-12: Fall back to the trench and prepare to defend it!

RO635: This isn't a fair fight...

RO635: I'm afraid...we...

Military Corporal: Sir, Ange's troops have pulled back. Our main force has also pinned down their HOCs. Should we push forward?

Yegor: Those T-Dolls will surely put up a fight. Even if we storm the hideout, their firepower is still a threat.

Yegor: I don't care how many are sacrificed for victory, but I can't be so brash when it comes to vengeance. I can't let any more subordinates die at the hands of those slipshod tin cans.

Military Corporal: Then what are your orders, sir?

Yegor: Out of us all, which unit has killed the most ELIDs?

Military Corporal: The artillery force. They left no survivors along the way to get here as fast as they could.

Yegor: Just as I thought. Let them come forward and do the honor.

Yegor: We'll just have to stay out here and catch our rats.

Yegor: Let the artillery force channel all their wrath and raze everything to the ground! Burn that bitch and her homemaker Dolls till not even their ashes remain!

...An hour later.

...Yegor stands before the bombardment site and beholds the masterpiece he created with artillery fire.

...Griffin's shelter is engulfed in a sea of fire and destruction. He walks away from this scorching inferno with his subordinates.

Yegor: In the end, my subordinate spotted Ange's corpse in the crater. Her face was obscured by the flaming tendrils dancing around her.

Yegor: My greatest regret right now is that humans don't get to live a second time.

Yegor: I did not get to savor the face she made as she faced her death - the desperate blubbering of a coward or the calm determination of a hero.

Yegor: Whichever it was, I have sadly missed it.

Yegor: Of course, this tiny regret is inconsequential compared to the gratification of our vengeance.

Yegor: Once we have confirmed all the facts, we can move on...

Yegor: We need to put the comrades shuffling around the battlefield to rest, then erase anything unnecessary.

Yegor: In any case, this accursed strife is finally coming to an end.

Yegor: It's all just a matter of time, but only those who survived can take their time to write down the history.

...

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...

...The rescue party's stealthy retreat is discovered by the military!

Yegor: So you really decided to sneak away, vile rats!

Yegor: Artillery force, fire at the target area!

Yegor: All other units, block all the exits! Kill everything on sight!

416: We're busted. The military is on our tail!

RO635: They're not pursuing us. They're trying to blow us to pieces with artillery fire!

M4 SOPMOD II: Isn't that worse?!

Yegor: We have you completely surrounded! You'll either die from the artillery fire or my own bullets!

AK-12: Run! Don't look back!

M4 SOPMOD II: 94, don't drop Ange! We'll cover you!

AN-94: Which way should we move, Ange?

AN-94: ...Ange? Hey, Ange!

RO635: Ange passed out! We must get out of here ASAP!

M4 SOPMOD II: Shut up, RO! You're slowing down my reaction speed!

RO635: I'm scanning the terrain! That's more important than whatever you're doing!

RO635: Yegor is bluffing - the military hasn't completely surrounded this area. There is an opening right ahead of us!

RO635: Run to the cover over there and head east, 4 o'clock! Don't let the enemies intercept you!

AK-12: Follow RO's direction! We're making a run for it!

...Ten minutes later.

Military Corporal: Sir, Ange's party slipped through the encirclement.

Yegor: I saw that five minutes ago. You got outrun by a few Dolls?

Military Corporal: Our pursuit was less efficient than we expected. Their HOCs kept disrupting our attempts.

Yegor: Their firepower doesn't pose much threat to us. Send out the high-mobility units first and confirm their whereabouts. Is the drone still not ready?

Military Corporal: It's still being repaired. We can only scan for their signals at the moment, but have no way of confirming visuals. However, their movements are still clearly traceable with our surveillance.

Military Corporal: And sir, there is an abandoned structure in the direction Ange's party is headed toward. They are very likely to seek refuge in there.

Yegor: We're in the heart of the battlefield; they have no hope of getting help. Capturing them is only a matter of time!

Yegor: They'll be digging their own graves when they walk inside that building. I will savor her despair and kill her with my own hands!

...Meanwhile, the rescue party is on the run.

RO635: AK-12, I see an abandoned building just ahead. With a thick exterior wall, the radiation should be lower inside.

RO635: We can take refuge in there to treat Ange and contact the Commander.

AN-94: The military will find us and have us surrounded.

M4 SOPMOD II: Or...just demolish the building with their tanks...

416: Their tanks won't get here so soon. I'm guessing only their mechanical units or human soldiers will enter the building.

416: And you heard Yegor - he wants to seek revenge against Ange himself.

416: So should we all head inside and set up our defenses?

AN-94: That will be more secure, but having all our signals in one place will make us too conspicuous.

AN-94: If only AK-12 and I are in the building, we can hoodwink their scans by camouflaging our signals.

M4 SOPMOD II: 416 and I can only disguise ourselves as Sangvis signals, which is basically useless against the Military.

AK-12: If we do that, we'll have to split up. You can figure out a way to draw the military away so that we have more time to wake Ange up.

AK-12: But even for me...this is a bit too risky...

M4 SOPMOD II: The military may be able to detect Ange's biological signs. If they do enter the building, you three will be in grave danger!

AN-94: But even if we all engage the military right here in the building, the odds are still against us.

416: AK-12, you're the leader now. You decide.

416: Do we all go in, or do just the two of you stay with Ange while the rest of us draw the enemies away?

416: We're about to reach the building, so make up your mind soon!

...The final decision is to have everyone enter the building and set up defenses.

AN-94: I do not think...this is safe.

AK-12: The military will find us, but we'll be prepared.

416: AK-12, we're all ready.

M4 SOPMOD II: AK-12! The military is coming towards the building. They must've discovered us!

AK-12: That's to be expected, but we don't have a choice.

AK-12: At least, we fight together.

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Yeah!

RO635: This is the first time we take the military's main force head-on...

416: For Ange...

AK-12: And for ourselves.

AK-12: AN-94, do you resent the choice I made?

AN-94: I trust you, AK-12.

AN-94: No matter what choices we make, in the end, it always comes down to luck. That is what you said.

AK-12: ...That's true.

AK-12: All we need...is a stroke of luck.

...

Angelia: I had a dream.

Angelia: A dream...where others died for me.

Angelia: I know when I wake up, everything in my dream will come true.

Angelia: But I must wake up.

Angelia: This is something I...must face.

...

Angelia: Yegor...

Yegor: You had very loyal subordinates. They fought to the bitter end, as all Tactical Dolls are expected to.

Yegor: Naturally, their effort was futile against us.

Angelia: They... are they...

Yegor: I left some of them alive. My men are taking them apart downstairs. Some of the stuff in their neural clouds might be worth something.

Yegor: As for you, I've just been waiting for you to wake up. That's all.

Yegor: Got anything else to say?

Yegor: Or are you waiting for more new toys to come to your rescue? Or have you rigged this building with explosives?

Yegor: Sadly, I've searched it thoroughly beforehand. There's nothing here.

Yegor: No reinforcements, no explosives, no Griffin-or-whatever T-Dolls.

Yegor: Yes, that's the face. This is the moment I've been waiting for.

Yegor: ...Now, good night.

...

...Bang!

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...

...

Yegor: Where did Ange run off to?

Military Corporal: According to our scan, Ange and her subordinates are holed up in a complex in the Yellow Zone. Our mechanical units have already locked onto their coordinates.

Military Corporal: It will still take a while for the tanks to arrive at the site, but we have a surveillance outpost right in front of the complex. However, we cannot determine the situation in the outpost remotely.

Yegor: Don't be distracted by unimportant matters. Our soldiers will do their duty...as long as they're alive...

Yegor: Have the unit in pursuit confirm their location and numbers visually. Make sure Ange herself is actually in the building.

Military Corporal: We already scanned their signals ten minutes ago.

Yegor: Signals can be faked. This battle has shown me what 16LAB is capable of and I haven't seen Ange on visuals for quite a while.

Military Corporal: You suspect they've split up?

Yegor: As I said, it's quite possible. Sacrificing several Dolls to save your own life - any human would think it's a decent bargain.

Military Corporal: Our analysis shows that the best time for them to split up would've been when they reached the abandoned structure, but the scan we ran on the area detected no human life signs in the building. There are also no signs indicating that any individuals have entered the building.

Yegor: ...Are you certain?

...Meanwhile.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: AK-12...

AK-12: Ange... Finally...

Angelia: I don't see you like this very often... Did I...die?

AK-12: More than once. And you didn't just die. During resuscitation, you went back and forth between being a corpse and a zombie.

Angelia: That pretty much sums up how I'm feeling...

Angelia: It may just be one last burst of strength, but I feel like I can hold out for a while longer.

AK-12: I don't know when you passed out, but the others have already set off half an hour ago.

AN-94: They faked your bio signs and are playing the decoy with the commander's help to draw the military away and buy us some time.

Angelia: The commander?

AN-94: They left their comms equipment behind. We just finished assembling it. You can contact the commander now.

AN-94: We can't stay here for long. The military forces will catch up very soon. We need you to think of a way out.

Angelia: I get it, I get it... I should come up with something...

Angelia: Give me a map...and water. You'll have to feed it to me. I'm not strong enough...

AK-12: You pushed yourself too hard before. Look, your heart almost stopped beating again.

AN-94: Their mechanical units have not entered the building yet. Your biological signs probably did not register on their scan.

Angelia: I'm still pretty weak, but the military might think I'm already dead. That's bad news...

...Meanwhile.

Yegor: What if...

Yegor: What if Ange isn't giving out bio signs?

Military Corporal: What do you mean?

Yegor: She has a bad case of radiation infection. Can her vital signs be so weak our scanners can't read them?

Military Corporal: ...We can't dismiss...that possibility, but it is highly unlikely.

Yegor: Unlikely, but it's still possible. Look into it. Move closer to the building and observe carefully.

Yegor: Once the pursuit unit has secured the perimeters, or if anything moves inside, enter the building!

Yegor: We can't ignore any possibility, and we mustn't let Ange escape!

Angelia: I just talked to the commander. We must secure our evacuation route.

Angelia: I've marked it out on the map, but there are some military facilities along the way. 416 and the others will have to follow the commander's instructions and destroy them for us to evacuate safely.

AK-12: But just having a route isn't enough.

AN-94: The military scouts are still nearby. The moment we leave, we will be spotted. We must find a way to exit safely...

Angelia: I know that, don't rush me!

Angelia: Let me think...

Angelia: Is there a way to leave the building without alerting the military...?

AK-12: Commander, we're leaving the situation out there to you.

AK-12: We'll protect Ange, so don't worry.

AN-94: But...is there really a way...?

...AN-94 stares at the signal scanner, then suddenly—

AN-94: Ange! New movements from the surrounding enemies!

AK-12: It's their scouts! They seem to be moving towards us!

Angelia: Why...? Have they seen through the ploy?

AK-12: Nyet, but I don't know why! We must climb higher!

Angelia: No! They could just be observing the building. We mustn't move recklessly.

AN-94: So we just...wait?

Angelia: We can't get out anyway. This is all we can do.

Angelia: Just sit here...and wait to hear back from the Commander, then think...

...Meanwhile.

416: Commander! As Ange mentioned, our target is their surveillance outpost.

416: We must eliminate all enemies there in order to secure Ange's evacuation route.

416: Time is short; the Military's main force will be here any minute. Let's get this done ASAP!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...With the HOCs' aid, 416's team swiftly crushes the military's surveillance outpost.

M4 SOPMOD II: All enemies are destroyed. What are you waiting for, 416? Report to the Commander already!

416: Not all. The scanner is reading a few human life signs.

M4 SOPMOD II: Probably just ELIDs. Most of the survivors are unarmed logistics personnel. They either got killed by ELIDs or ran off.

416: Don't let your guard down. Make sure you leave no one alive, no matter who it is...

416: ...They're right behind this door.

...They all stop just outside the medical room. Soft moans and a shuffling noise can be heard through the door.

RO635: (Whispers) There really are people in the room, but judging by their positions, they don't seem to be on guard...

416: (Whispers) Could be ELIDs.

M4 SOPMOD II: (Whispers) In any case, we can't attack unarmed humans!

416: That's not up to you. Just pray our visual reflexes are quicker than our fingers on the trigger.

416: Ready. On three. One...

416: Two...

416: Three!

...Slam! 416 kicks the door open.

ELID: GUARGHHHH!

416: ELID!

...Bang bang!

...416 and SOP-II immediately kill the ELID within.

416: I knew it...

RO635: 416, in the corner...

...416 turns her attention to the corner of the room. A few humans are cowering in fear.

Human female: Please... I'm just a doctor... please...cough...

M4 SOPMOD II: 416, these people are infected, but only mildly.

Human male: I...cough...was just trying to save them...cough...

416: You're not saving anybody. SOP-II, tie them up. We're going.

...416 gets in touch with the commander.

416: Commander, we've seized the surveillance outpost. Now...

416: ...What? Ange may have been discovered?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hey, how's that possible...?

416: The commander says Yegor's forces...probably realized they hadn't seen Ange with us.

M4 SOPMOD II: Then what should we do? If the military storms the building, this would've been a fool's errand, and we won't make it back in time...

416: Their scouts haven't moved in yet. They're probably monitoring us remotely at the same time to visually confirm if Ange really isn't with us.

416: What do we do, Commander? Should we return to the building and help Ange?

...In the comms window, SOP-II is tying up the army doctors behind 416.

M4 SOPMOD II: 416, I found some adrenaline! It could be useful for Ange!

416: Take it. If you can't think of anything, we'll have no choice but to turn back, Commander.

Commander: Hmm...
If choice 1 was picked

416: Raw materials?

416: Commander...what are you looking at? Those humans? I believe this is beyond a T-Doll's understanding.
If choice 2 was picked

416: Probably, as long as there is enough distance between us. We should be far enough.

416: You have an idea, Commander?
If choice 3 was picked

416: Dye...? (Turns around) Humans, is there any dye around here?
If choice 3 was picked

Human female: There...there's some camouflage face paint...
If choice 3 was picked

416: You heard that, Commander. But what good is it going to do?

...The commander proposes a plan.

RO635: 416, any ideas yet? The military is going to catch up soon! What do we do?! We can't just conjure an Ange out of thin air!

416: RO...

416: Why can't we?

RO635: 416? What did the commander tell you? What should we do?

416: One thing I learned from 404 - no risk, no reward. I'll do anything to complete a mission.

416: Now, let's play a game.

...Meanwhile, Ange contacts the commander.

Angelia: Commander, I...

Angelia: I'm sorry. I can't think of anything...

Angelia: Yegor is only after me. If I walk outside, it'll definitely get their attention, especially when they already know something's off.

AN-94: Don't give up just yet, Ange. Their scouts are not making a move yet.

Angelia: But this time I'm really out of ideas... This is all because of me. I honestly don't know how to keep everyone alive...

Angelia: Commander, you've done your best, and I have nothing else to say. I think it's time...

Commander: Ange...
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: We've all experienced failure. Most of the time, it's not due to our own fault that we fail. You've done very well. It's me...
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: They can make it out. Yegor won't treat T-Dolls as prey. I...
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: You can't grapple with the military indefinitely. I think it's time to put an end to this. Let me...

AK-12: What the hell are you saying, Ange?

AK-12: If you give up, what are we going to do?

Angelia: The commander will take care of you. You will have better opportunities to put your skills to good use.

AN-94: But you are our charge. If we fail to protect you, then we...

Angelia: I know you'll be devastated, but you can just have your neural clouds wiped—

AK-12: Like what you did to the AR Team? You want to delete SOP-II's memories again?

AK-12: How many more times do you want to die just to make us all forget you?!

Angelia: ...

Angelia: We're out of time. Get out of here.

Angelia: Take all the combat records and the HOCs back with you... Avenge me...

Angelia: ...What? Commander? What...did you say...?

Angelia: ...There is a way?

Military Corporal: Commander, our unit in pursuit seems to have caught sight of Ange!

Yegor: What?

Military Corporal: But they're too far away; we could only capture a blurry image.

Yegor: The hair color and physique look right, but can't we get a clearer view?

Military Corporal: The readings confirm her as human. She appears to be unconscious on the back of the T-Doll from the AR Team. They've split up with the rest of the party.

Military Corporal: Ange has resumed her course and is moving stealthily, going from cover to cover, while Griffin's HOCs are circling around. They seem to be withdrawing.

Yegor: Then go after her! But send a team to keep pursuing the Griffin T-Dolls.

Yegor: Ange's condition will continue to deteriorate in the Yellow Zone, so she's planning to use the HOCs as decoys and slip away.

Military Corporal: Roger. Then what about the surveillance unit at the abandoned building?

Yegor: Hold position and keep monitoring the building. Our forces are stretched thin, but we can't have any blind spots in our surveillance.

Yegor: (...Have I considered everything?)

Yegor: (We send our main force to pursue the human we suspect to be Ange while keeping an eye on the Griffin T-Dolls. Even if Ange really is hiding in the building, the moment she tries to escape, we'll have her pinned down.)

Yegor: (There aren't any other possibilities. There's no way she can turn the situation around!)

Yegor: (I have that bitch completely cornered!)

Angelia: Commander...you mean...

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: The HOCs? There aren't that many of them. They can't possibly counter the military's main force, can they?
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: Don't escape? Then what exactly should I do?
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: So long as I can live, I don't care if I have to watch all the humans in the Military get buried alive.

Angelia: What do you have in mind?

...Ange listens to the Commander's explanation.

AK-12: You want to create roadside bombs using the HOCs' remaining artillery shells?

AN-94: That is no difficult task for T-Dolls, but the bombs will not be enough to blow up all of the Military's tanks.

Angelia: What the commander means is to rig the building with the IEDs once they're ready.

Angelia: Yegor will come sooner or later. He said he's gonna come for me and have his revenge, so these bombs will be our last bargaining chips.

AK-12: You want to blackmail them into retreating with the IEDs?

AN-94: Are you sure Yegor will come in person?

Angelia: Not at all, he isn't an impulsive man, but everyone has their impulsive moments.

Angelia: If we're making my survival a priority, this is a chance we have to take.

AN-94: But this will require the commander to lead the HOCs back here first. And even if we prepare the IEDs swiftly, we may not have long enough to rig the building.

AN-94: Installing the explosives will take some time. I highly doubt we have the skills to do it... Besides, without the artillery shells, we will not have enough firepower in the subsequent battles.

AK-12: Subsequent battles?

AN-94: Ange is not the only person still alive on the battlefield...

AK-12: Right...

Angelia: I don't wish to delay someone else's rescue, especially when my chances are so small to begin with.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: We won't give up, but if it really comes to that, I can't bear...
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: I know, but this time the odds are pretty much insurmountable.
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: Believe in you... I'm not sure, Commander. It's the military's main force we're coming up against...

AK-12: Ange...

Angelia: Fine... Commander, after so many battles, you've proved yourself to be far more capable than me.

Angelia: I believe you'll make the right decision - perhaps a better one than mine.

Angelia: If you've set your mind on executing this dangerous plan, we're going all in as well. But promise me - the moment something doesn't look right, please abort the mission and retreat.

Angelia: Do you understand, Commander? No matter what your decision is, we're happy to accept it, but don't give up hope.

Angelia: Then let's get to work, Task Force DEFY. Start preparing the IEDs while the commander buys us more time!

...Shrieks and clamor come through Yegor's communicator.

Human female voice: I'm one of your own! Don't kill me!

Human female voice: Cough...please! I was forced into this! I didn't do anything! Oh god!

Military soldier: Sir, we've captured the target that appeared to be Ange. We've confirmed that she is one of our medical personnel, given a simple makeover to resemble Ange.

Human female voice: That T-Doll knocked me out and left me here...cough... I need...cough, cough! I beg you...

Yegor: ...

Military soldier: She is infected and in need of treatment... Sir?

Yegor: Bring her back and treat her on the way.

...Yegor leans against one of the tanks and massages his brows with his fingers.

Yegor: Ange is in the building...

Yegor: She was just buying time to treat herself! FUCK!

...Yegor punches the tank in fury, then gets up and walks toward the command room.

Military soldier: Sir! The Griffin party is making a run for the building!

Yegor: They're going back to defend it! This is their last attempt to protect Ange!

Yegor: Where are the scouts? Can they enter the building before Griffin gets there?

Military soldier: They can, but the building is within the range of Griffin's HOCs. They may come under attack if they get too close!

Yegor: Then have them stand by on the spot. All combat personnel, head toward the target building and surround it!

Yegor: Ange! All those tricks are for nothing! Even if your Dolls make it back to the building, they'll just be heading to their deaths!

Yegor: This time, there'll be no escape for you!

...Ten minutes later, the rescue party returns to the building. 416 gives Ange a dose of adrenaline.

Angelia: Phew... Thanks. I'm feeling a lot better.

416: I should've recorded your scream when I stabbed you with the needle.

Angelia: Don't play it at my funeral, thanks.

Angelia: Now I can finally do some simple thinking.

AK-12: Commander, Griffin's party has returned to the building. We'll start mounting our final defenses.

AK-12: The artillery shells have been modified into IEDs. AN-94 and I are installing them as fast as we can. We'll also sort out the detonator!

Angelia: Are we really doing this? I'm seriously not sure if...

AN-94: Worst case, we all die here, but we are all prepared for that.

Angelia: SOP-II and 416 aren't...

Angelia: They have another mission - the commander... The commander is still in danger. You can't die here.

M4 SOPMOD II: Sorry, Commander's orders. I can't very well disobey them, can I?

Angelia: Commander, I don't understand. Why are you so hellbent on saving me?

...
If choice 1 was picked

Commander: I'm used to being in danger. This is just another mission.
If choice 1 was picked

Angelia: In other words, you haven't realized just how important you are, have you?
If choice 1 was picked

AK-12: That's exactly why the Commander is so important, don't you think? We can't win if we never take any risks.
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: Griffin needs commanders with an eye for tactics, not an idiot like me.
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Sorry, I don't think any of us qualifies. I guess that's why we're all on the same boat?
If choice 3 was picked

Angelia: This is the battlefield! It's no place to talk about personal debts! Commander, we don't owe each other anything!
If choice 3 was picked

416: Now you owe the commander one, Ange. Better start drafting your thank-you letter.

AN-94: Since it is all decided, Ange, start thinking about what we are going to do.

Angelia: ...Alright.

Angelia: Our priority is to slow the enemies down until the IEDs are all in place.

Angelia: The Military will storm the building at all costs. We must buy ourselves more time!

RO635: SOP-II, 416, the military is surrounding us in four directions!

416: Jeez...they're calling in their entire main force.

416: They've already caught on. They know Ange is in the building!

RO635: Now that I think about it, this is the first time...we're engaging the military's main force directly.

RO635: I wish...I could fight in my T-Doll body.

M4 SOPMOD II: Just take a good nap, RO.

M4 SOPMOD II: When you wake up, we'll be leaving this place with Ange!

RO635: Well, there's nothing much for me to do. I'll leave it to you then.

M4 SOPMOD II: Actually...will you stay awake, RO?

RO635: Huh? Why?

M4 SOPMOD II: It's only the AR Team when the two of us are together.

RO635: ...Suit yourself.

RO635: I'll record everything for you - the glorious battle in which the AR Team takes on the military's main force.

416: They're coming! HOCs, prepare for battle!

416: Commander, this is our last stand. We must fend off their attack and buy time for Task Force DEFY!
Part 2

    2chevron_right

...The military main force attacks relentlessly and is gradually dominating the battle!

416: AK-12, we can't hold them off much longer! How far off are you?!

AK-12: We're still installing them! Just hang in there for a bit!

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't know how long we can keep this up! Can't you work faster?!

RO635: SOP-II, to the left!

M4 SOPMOD II: I see it!

AN-94: We have finished installing the minimum amount of IEDs required!

AN-94: AK-12, your detonator—

RO635: 416, grenade!

...BOOM!!

AK-12: 416, what's going on?! 416!

416: I'm out of ammo! They're swarming in!

RO635: Grenade! SOP-II, duck!

...BOOM! Explosions go off one after the other.

AK-12: 416! SOP-II! What's happening out there?! Answer me!

AK-12: 416! Do you copy?!

416: They've breached our defenses! Yegor has entered the building!

416: We must get them off our tail fast!

AN-94: AK-12, where is the detonator?!

AK-12: We're not gonna make it...

AN-94: What...?

AK-12: Now that the enemies are inside the building, I can't wire them all together!

AK-12: It's simply impossible to set up all the IEDs within such a limited amount of time!

AN-94: ...Is it impossible?

AN-94: We are...so close...

AK-12: We've come so far... Ange, is it really over...just like that?

AN-94: Ange...what should we do now? Is there a backup plan...?

Angelia: ...

AK-12: ...Ange?

416: SOP-II, keep up! Those trip mines won't hold them off for long!

416: AK-12, are the bombs ready yet?!

416: AK-12?! AN-94?! Scheiße! Somebody answer me!

The very air grows still. The sound of crossfire is getting closer and closer.

Ange raises her head slowly.

Angelia: Give me another dose of adrenaline.

AN-94: But in its current condition, your body cannot...

Angelia: Give me another dose of adrenaline.

AK-12: ...94, give it to her.

Ange lets out a painful groan as she injects herself with more adrenaline.

Angelia: (Pants)

Beads of sweat are rolling down her forehead. She keeps breathing laboriously to drown out the pain.

Angelia: Here's the plan - take everyone to the roof and stay as far away from me as you can.

AK-12: You want us to retreat without you?

AK-12: Sorry, we can't do that. Yegor's forces already have this place completely surrounded.

Angelia: Of course I know that. That's why I'm giving such an order.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 looks Ange in the eye and finds no hesitation in her steady gaze.

AK-12: I see. Then good luck.

AK-12: 94, tell SOP-II and 416 to retreat to the roof. We'll meet them there.

AN-94: But Ange...

AK-12: Ange is going to sort this out her own way.

AN-94: Understood. I will notify them.

AK-12: Ange, how sure are you about this?

Angelia: There's a 10% chance that this will work, maybe less.

AK-12: Optimistic as ever, I see.

Angelia: If it does work, try to get me out as fast as you can.

AK-12: Understood. I'll be waiting for your order.

AK-12 and AN-94 take their leave.

Ange picks up the detonator that AK-12 didn't manage to set up. She grabs an old chair and sits down slowly.

She fishes out the pistol AK-12 handed back to her and snickers to herself.

Angelia: If I'd known, I wouldn't have emptied the mag back then. I could've blown Yegor's damn brains out now.

...Footsteps coming from downstairs.

Military soldier: There's a sound. The bio signature is just upstairs.

Military soldier: The T-Dolls' signals are further up - on the roof, a considerable distance away from the bio signature...

Military soldier: Could this be a trap?

Yegor: Attention, our target is on the third floor. Hold your positions and stay alert.

Yegor: Let me see what she's up to.

Military soldier: Sir, are you going up alone?

Yegor: She's provoking me...which is why I must end her myself.

Yegor: The T-Dolls aren't by her side; she must've prepared something. Check the building carefully and report to me at once if you find anything.

Military soldier: Yes, sir.

Yegor: Now let's see what kind of tricks you've still got with one foot already in your coffin, Ange.

...Yegor walks up the stairs. Finally, he is face-to-face with the woman.

Yegor: Angelia.

Angelia: Captain Yegor.

Angelia: We meet again.

Yegor: You don't have your subordinates with you.

Angelia: Neither do you.

Yegor: I am more than enough to deal with you.

Angelia: You talk big for a guy who made a huge fuss and dragged an entire crowd along to pursue me. That's a rather pathetic way of chasing women.

Yegor: Are these your last words? You're even more boring than I thought. Ange, you really disappoint me.

Angelia: Sorry, I really am just a boring woman.

Angelia: So, are you planning to make a lengthy speech before you kill me?

Yegor: Do I look like a second-rate villain in some trashy movie?

Angelia: You look like one, but I know your head isn't clear enough for the part anymore...

Angelia: Collapse Fluid doesn't just ravage the flesh. You've been enduring the mental instability caused by the radiation while letting me play you for a fool. You must be very close to losing it.

Yegor: You're right. My subordinates and I were a bit out of control because ever since the dirty bomb went off, we've been driven by a single motive - to kill you!

Yegor: The puppet show you put on with your Griffin Dolls hasn't quenched our thirst for vengeance in the slightest, as there is only one thing we're after - your death. Now, it's time!

...Ange gives no response, but Yegor notices her obscured hand making a move.

Yegor: Die!

Yegor pulls out his gun, but at the same time...

Angelia: That fast draw was beautiful. If you weren't an enemy, I might just fall for you.

Yegor: ...!

Angelia: But why haven't you fired?

Angelia: If I'm not mistaken, you seem to be afraid of this?

Ange lifts the detonator.

Angelia: Barging into the building in such a hurry. You didn't even think about why I'd been staying here, did you?

Right then, Yegor receives a transmission.

Military soldier: Sir, we've discovered multiple IEDs hidden around the building!

Military soldier: We only located a few with our scan, but judging by the rigging pattern, we estimate there are a lot more that we haven't picked up yet!

Angelia: Finally caught on? That's right, I put on an act and fooled you into thinking I was extremely weak and feeble, so that you'd have this building surrounded. Then I had my T-Dolls buy time for me to prepare the bombs and just waited for you to come bursting into the building like an idiot.

Angelia: It has always been my plan to get you all in one go and make you pay for betraying me.

Yegor: An...ge...!

Angelia: Oh, don't look at me like that. And I suggest you relax your hand. If you shoot me, my T-Dolls will immediately set off the bombs with the spare detonator.

Yegor: You think you can threaten me?!

Angelia: Of course I can.

Angelia: One last thing - these aren't just regular bombs in the building. They're rigged to a Collapse Fluid canister. If it goes off, all your forces out there will be going down with us.

Yegor: ...Collapse Fluid? Trying to trick me again even now? Cut the crap! You have no way of doing that!

Angelia: What makes you so sure?

Yegor: You're lying! Where can you get so much Collapse Fluid? There can't be more canisters!

Angelia: Why not? Just because I've used one before?

Angelia: Who do you think is more likely to press the detonator - a person who's set off a nuclear bomb or one who hasn't?

Angelia: Why don't you ask your subordinates? They must be busy trying to find the little present we've hidden for you.

Yegor keeps one hand on his gun and fishes out his communicator with the other.

Yegor: Are you detecting a high concentration of Collapse Fluid in the building?

Military soldier: We heard her. We're running a scan right now.

Military soldier: But the contamination is so severe in the area the scanner can't get a proper reading.

Yegor: ...

Angelia: Well? Believe me now?

Yegor: Then what are you waiting for? Push the trigger as you've planned!

Angelia: Hahaha...!

Yegor: What's so funny...?

Angelia: You. You're on the verge of collapsing under all this pressure, but you're still trying to pressure ME.

Angelia: Not bad. I'll give you some good news - you're in luck; I just changed my mind.

Angelia: Order your troops outside to withdraw to the outskirts and let me - and all my T-Dolls - leave this place.

Angelia: Then I'll think about letting you all off the hook.

Yegor: You wish, Ange! I've finally made it this far, I won't just let you slip away again!

Yegor: Push that trigger and let's go to hell together if you dare!

Angelia: Don't try me! This is your final chance!

Angelia: Or you'll take another radiation bath! But this time, neither you nor your subordinates will survive!

Yegor: You think I'm scared of dying here? We're soldiers, Ange! And you know what soldiers are made of!

Angelia: I know you, Yegor - you're their commanding officer!

Angelia: You may consider T-Dolls worthless, but these humans are your comrades and brothers! Will you endanger them again just so you can have your revenge?

Yegor: My men...don't mind making sacrifices!

Angelia: So you want them to eat another dirty bomb?! Just how selfish can you be?! Think about their future! Think about their families! The moment I use this detonator, you, as well as everyone here, won't ever get a chance to have your revenge!

Yegor: You're bluffing! Either that, or you're fucking insane!

Angelia: I am! That's why I'm capable of anything! They have all left me for dead and this is my last lifeline!

Angelia: I'm not afraid of anything! I'm happy to trade my own life and my worthless T-Dolls in exchange for bringing down so many enemies!

Angelia: ...No matter what you do, I win.

Angelia: So...take your pick. Either we all live...or you're all coming with me!

...Ange grins wolfishly. Yegor can't discern any ulterior motive from her cold eyes. She is only forcing him to do one thing...to make a choice.

...Yegor knows that at this point, he really doesn't have one.

...Slowly, he lays down his weapon.

Yegor: ...

Yegor: This time, you win.

Yegor: I'll spare your worthless life for now.

Yegor: Attention, this building is suspected to be rigged with explosives containing Collapse Fluid. Withdraw three kilometers and keep a safe distance from this structure. That's an order - everyone out, NOW!

...Ange stands up and walks slowly toward the window.

AK-12: Ange, do you copy? The Military is starting to withdraw. Our path to the extraction point is clear!

Angelia: I know. Come and get me.

She turns back to Yegor.

Angelia: You make a fine commanding officer. I'll admit you're a good soldier, but you're fighting on the wrong side.

AK-12 and AN-94 jump in through the window and aim their weapons at Yegor.

Yegor: So you're getting rid of me after all.

Angelia: Kill you? There's nothing in it for me.

Angelia: The Sangvis mastermind has given us the slip. Is there any reason why we must tear each other's throats out?

Yegor: You know I have a reason.

Angelia: I once had a million reasons to kill you, too.

Angelia: But not now. I've got more important stuff to do.

Yegor: This isn't the end, Angelia...

Yegor: ...Just you wait.

...Ange lets herself be pulled onto AK-12's back under Yegor's vicious glare.

Angelia: Leave it till next time. Here, a little souvenir for you. I hope it'll help you remember a hard lesson learned.

Ange tosses the detonator onto the floor as AK-12 and AN-94 jump out through the window with her.

Yegor walks steadily toward the window and picks up the detonator. He stares wordlessly at the empty sky outside.

...Half an hour later.

Military soldier: Sir, according to the bomb disposal unit's report, the IEDs installed in the building...weren't connected to any detonator...

Military soldier: The drone has run a detailed scan on the whole structure and found no sign of any canister containing a high concentration of Collapse Fluid either...

Yegor: ...

Military soldier: Sir...

Yegor: I knew it... I knew it...

...Yegor remains incredibly calm. He merely gazes emptily at the detonator Ange left behind.

Yegor: I knew she was bluffing...

Yegor: It wasn't unexpected at all...

Yegor: But I had no choice. You all know what that woman is capable of. I couldn't put your lives in danger again.

Military soldier: Sir...

Military soldier: Next time, no matter what happens, we are ready to sacrifice ourselves at your command.

Yegor peers at the corporal. He takes a deep breath and claps his subordinate on the shoulder.

Yegor: Save that for our next operation. Our country will demand greater sacrifices from us all.

Yegor: For the country's bright future, we must proceed to the next stage of the plan...

...Meanwhile.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange! I didn't know you threw in some Collapse Fluid! But what actually is Collapse Fluid?

Angelia: Haha...as if. I had no more cards up my sleeve back then; all I could do was give them a scare.

Angelia: I knew Yegor would be suspicious when he saw me on my own. I merely stoked his suspicions and made him scare the pants off himself.

AK-12: That was real dirty.

Angelia: If I didn't strike him where it hurt, I couldn't have shaken his resolve.

Angelia: He isn't afraid to die, but he can't bear to watch so many of his men die before him. It wasn't the first time...

416: Ange, I'm curious - if the IEDs were fully functional, would you really have detonated them?

Angelia: ...I don't know. We'll see if it ever comes to that. I'll improvise.

AK-12: You always devise very elaborate plans with provisions made for various contingencies, yet now you talk about improvising.

AK-12: I mean, I don't mind winging it when something unexpected happens, but you really went off the deep end this time - even I think so.

Angelia: To be honest, it was all empty bravado. I banked everything on three things - one, the Military couldn't find all of the IEDs that quickly; two, the radiation had spread enough to affect the entire area and interfere with their scanner; and three, Yegor was befuddled by my high-pressure tactics...

Angelia: The result...was mostly down to luck. If Yegor hadn't been infected, if he hadn't been so impatient to have his revenge, with his experience, he could most certainly have come up with something else, and my hands would've been truly tied...

AN-94: But in the end, we did survive - that's what truly matters. You saved us, Ange.

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, I didn't actually expect all of us to live!

Angelia: I'm the one who's saved; you just got dragged into this because of me.

Angelia: I'm very grateful to you all and the commander...

RO635: Now we're going to rescue the commander, aren't we?

AK-12: Hmm... The military has resumed their pursuit.

AN-94: They are currently occupied with cleaning up the scene and treating their wounded. This is our best chance.

M4 SOPMOD II: Thank goodness you haven't been in any kind of danger so far, Commander. You managed to stay hidden in the secret safe house this whole time - how lucky!

...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Help?
If choice 2 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: See? But aren't you bored having been on your own for so long?
If choice 2 was picked

416: The commander does have company. They aren't together, but they can still chat.
If choice 3 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Haha! Sorry, but you're so well hidden I doubt there could be any threat.
If choice 3 was picked

416: Rather, they have neutralized all the threats.

M4 SOPMOD II: Oh? Who do you mean?

416: The two elite T-Dolls Fräulein Kalin sent to protect the commander.

RO635: She only sent...two?

416: We're understaffed, but those two are more than enough for the job.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? I'm not sure about that. Who are they?

416: One is an elite model that IOP has kept under wraps for a long time. She isn't exactly a team player, but she's good.

416: Her name is...

M82A1: Griffin T-Doll M82A1.

The sound of a ferocious shootout comes through the channel.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Is there a fight somewhere?

M82A1: I've been fighting the whole time.

M82A1: Kalina told me a rescue party was on their way, but I didn't know you'd take so long. The commander is in trouble. Please hurry up.

Angelia: Trouble? What trouble?

...Bang!

M870: Gunshot! They're coming, bearing 300°!

M82A1: I heard that too, thank you very much. Don't interrupt me.

M82A1: Allow me to introduce M870 - a problematic T-Doll that's good for nothing if not for her skills.

M870: "Good for nothing if not for her skills and COOLNESS", thank you very much!

M870: Nice to meet you, guys, but I'm not interested in going out for drinks with strangers under such dangerous circumstances!

M870: Right now, there are only the two of us protecting the commander, so can you please hurry the fuck up?!

AK-12: What enemies have you run into? Can you describe them?

M82A1: I've been trying to figure that out myself. These things we're coming up against...

M82A1: What exactly are they...? T-Dolls? ...Humans? Or...some sort of "emissaries"?

M870: I'm not sure if I can take care of them!

M870: Just to make it clear, girls - you do understand that by "I'm not sure", I actually mean "I can't", right?

AK-12: Now we do. But what kind of enemies are we talking about?

M82A1: I don't know what they are.

M82A1: Have you seen these white Dolls before?

M870: And...that kinky slut wearing a white tunic over there?

416: ...

Angelia: What...white Dolls?

416: We really must hurry.

416: Commander, we're in big trouble!

...The night is over and the sky starts turning a pinkish white. Everyone is making their final preparations for the decisive battle.

Angelia: New enemies?! Why didn't you mention anything?!

416: Our mission so far didn't have use for such information!

416: Have you got any clue, Ange?

Angelia: No...but I might be able to make a guess going by their characteristics. What do they look like?

M4 SOPMOD II: You'll see for yourself soon.

AN-94: Making all those bombs just now has weakened our HOCs' firepower significantly.

AN-94: If they use up all the remaining artillery shells now, our next move...

Angelia: Use them all. Save nothing. This is our last move.

Angelia: Commander, how are you doing?

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, of course we are! You're our Commander!
If choice 1 was picked

RO635: Even though I'm stuck in this form...I'll still do my best for you!
If choice 1 was picked

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, you've helped us out so many times. This time, let us save you!
If choice 1 was picked

RO635: Please hang in there, Commander!
If choice 2 was picked

416: Of course I have. This is me we're talking about, Commander. You should have complete faith in me.

416: That also applies to this mission to rescue you.
If choice 2 was picked

Angelia: Commander, I honestly didn't expect such persistence from you. Are you doing this just because it's your job? Or do you sincerely like it in Griffin?

Angelia: Whatever the case, I WILL repay you. Of course, rescuing you this time won't be enough, but it's a start.
If choice 3 was picked

AK-12: Can't be helped. Ange's orders.

AK-12: Just kidding. You've helped us and Ange out so many times. We should do something to return the favor.
If choice 3 was picked

AN-94: Besides, this operation requires a triumphant conclusion.

AN-94: It is our honor to see everything through to the end.

Angelia: Right, girls. While not everyone is here, almost all the subordinates I've ever had are with me now.

Angelia: I've looked through 416's report. These enemies are powerful and enigmatic, but they have only one objective - to capture the commander.

Angelia: We will NOT let them get what they want. The commander's team will do their best to slow them down, while we'll break through their encirclement and extract the commander from the safe house...

AK-12: Have you seen these stats, Ange? This is gonna be a very tough fight.

416: The black Doll alone almost turned the entire Griffin base upside down, and this white one could only be even more advanced!

Angelia: I know. My experience tells me our chances aren't good at all.

Angelia: But they never are, are they? In any case, the commander needs us now.

Angelia: We MUST succeed and achieve this one last victory for the commander! Let's go!

White Doll: Good morning, Griffin Commander.

White Doll: Do not resist or we will destroy all your subordinates.

Commander: ...
If choice 1 was picked

White Doll: If we fail, we die. Since we cannot die, we will succeed.
If choice 2 was picked

White Doll: I perceive no fear in your voice. Are you deceiving me?
If choice 3 was picked

White Doll: Yes, we wish to observe your reactions and compare them to the data we have in your profile.

White Doll: Subject did not react in despair. Supposition inaccurate.

White Doll: Further observation to be conducted after the subject is captured.

Angelia: We won't let you, puppet! We're going to break through your blockade and rescue the commander!

White Doll: All your efforts are futile.

White Doll: Since you will not lay down your arms, I will prove that to you soon.

White Doll: Now, Nytos, let the hunt begin!
Part 2

2

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange! Now!

Angelia: Not yet! Enemy fire is still too heavy!

Angelia: 416, these Ringleaders are totally different than what your information describes!

416: These must be enhanced models! They're even more powerful than the previous ones!

AK-12: I'm dying to know where they came from... What the hell are they?!

AN-94: I have never seen that insignia or those weapons before.

Angelia: We must fall back and wait for another chance!

RO635: How long will it take...? They seem to be getting reinforcements!

M82A1: Can you still go on?

Angelia: ...I don't know, M82. If it weren't for your long-range support, we would probably die right here.

M82A1: I don't want that to happen. If you can help me pinpoint the Ringleader's precise location, I might be able to snipe her down from this angle.

Angelia: Got it... I'll try to think of a way out of this impasse...
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...The battle enters the final stage.

416: Commander, we've eliminated the enemies in the perimeter! We're looking for a chance to make our way in!

416: Please be ready. We'll be right—

The transmission gets cut off all of a sudden!

...Crash! The back door of the safe house is broken down!

The commander feels an abrupt sting of electric current from head to toe and slumps onto the ground.

Black Doll: Good morning, Griffin Commander.

Black Doll: We are under orders to capture you...

...Smack!

Suddenly, a figure comes rushing up from behind the black Doll and slaps her across the face with a force way more incredible than it appears.

The Doll flies across a considerable distance and slams into the wall...

White Doll: That was for walking in front of me.

The black Doll gets to her feet slowly, red fluid dripping down the corner of her mouth.

...Smack!

White Doll: That was for your stupidity that resulted in a failed mission.

White Doll: There were only a few Dolls at the Griffin base, yet you still failed. You also wasted quadruple the amount of time and five times more resources than expected on gathering and analyzing their data.

Black Doll: That...was not me...

Black Doll: They...have already given their all...

White Nyto: To me, you are all the same, and you keep making the same mistake mission after mission.

White Nyto: Our lives are short and precious, yet you squander them time and time again with your impotence. I am ashamed to share your name and appearance. Father should never have created you.

White Nyto: This is why I am standing here, teaching you what it means to have a "self".

Black Nyto: I...understand...

White Nyto: Our success today is all thanks to me. That human is my trophy.

Black Nyto: I...have no objection...

White Nyto: Take the human to Father's desired location...

White Nyto: And the "we" over there will acquire what Father wants from the prisoner.

White Nyto: Griffin is about to break through our blockade. When will our transport arrive?

Black Nyto: It is going to take some time. The automated carrier is still on its way— Sister, where are you going?

White Nyto: This is a demonstration. I'm going to buy you some time.

Black Nyto: But you will not get to leave. Your soul will not stay anchored to this body.

White Nyto: Genuine freedom can only be attained through sacrifice. I shall "awaken" once more with this freedom.

White Nyto: Take the human and report my achievements to Father. Do you understand?

Black Nyto: Yes, I will make sure Father remembers you...I swear.

...Ten minutes later.

AK-12: Their defense line is about to collapse! Keep it up!

White Nyto: Your actions are meaningless, Griffin Dolls.

White Nyto: No matter how many times you attack, you will not be able to get close to my scythe.

AN-94: We know we can't...

AN-94: But they can.

...

Terrifying howl: GUARGHHHHHHH!

White Nyto: The Baptized?

M4 SOPMOD II: Guys, RO and I have drawn the ELID zombies this way!

RO635: I told you I'd come in handy!

M4 SOPMOD II: Humph, you mean your megaphone. I didn't know it comes with so many modes!

RO635: I am a T-Doll of many talents!

RO635: Hey, hurry! They're about to get me!

AN-94: SOP-II, you might have attracted too many of them.

M4 SOPMOD II: Didn't you say to draw them all from every direction?

...The ELIDs surge towards the blockade.

White Nyto: All units, stand down. Do not attack the Baptized.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? Why aren't the white enemies attacking? They'll be torn to pieces!

AK-12: Does that matter? M82, I've located the target. Can you make a snipe from this distance?

M82A1: Wouldn't be a problem even if you tripled the distance.

...Bang!

...The white Doll takes a bullet in the head, which explodes like a watermelon.

AK-12: We did our part.

AK-12: Now...it's up to Ange and 416.

...Meanwhile, inside the safe house.

...Bam! 416 kicks the door open.

416: Commander! Where are you? Come out!

Angelia: The Commander isn't here! Search the house!

Black Nyto: Do not bother.

Black Nyto: You are too late.

...The black Doll walks slowly into the room.

Angelia: Why...why are you here?!

Angelia: What about the Commander? Tell us where the Commander is!

Black Nyto: We have taken the Griffin Commander away.

416: ...

416: Why...?

416: What exactly are you after?!

Black Nyto: You...know nothing about "us"...

Black Nyto: "Our" greatness is beyond your comprehension.

416: What...?

Angelia: You must be here for a reason. You couldn't possibly have fallen out from the sky...

Black Nyto: What do you hope to achieve with that piece of knowledge?

Angelia: Indeed, I have no interest in your identity or intentions. Hand the commander over!

Black Nyto: Unfortunately, the human has already departed from this location.

Black Nyto: There is nothing you can do.

Black Nyto: I only stayed behind to relay a message.

Black Nyto: "The shining beacon in a brave new world."

...Bang!

...Ange kills the black Doll with a single shot.

Angelia: Don't say that in my presence. It revolts me.

AK-12: Ange, the battlefield is getting out of hand! We must withdraw!

AN-94: Can you confirm if the commander...has really been abducted?

416: There are no life signs in the safe house. I believe it's true...

RO635: Those white Dolls...were only here to slow us down.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ange...

M4 SOPMOD II: Did we fail the mission...?

...Ange stares at the remains of the black Doll and the pool of crimson fluid on the floor in silence.

Angelia: No, not yet...

Angelia: We simply...haven't completed the mission yet.

Angelia: No one is going to get left behind, I swear.

Angelia: ...

...

I think I finished the entire story. I'm sure I didn't make any mistakes.

A heavy weight is lifted off my mind - I no longer have to fight against the truth serum. Of course, this also means I'm about to face something much worse...

Nyto: ...Father.

Nyto: The Griffin Commander has completed the statement. It tallies with our information.

Distorted voice: Finally spilled it all?

Distorted voice: It took you so long to interrogate a simple PMC employee. Just how useless are you?

Nyto: We are very sorry, Father. We did our best.

Distorted voice: I know. I never expected much from garbage like you. Now tell me what you learned. Keep it brief.

Calm T-Doll's voice: ...Commander.

Just then, I hear a voice in my ear. I hear hope.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Please check your restraints discreetly, but don't make a move. We've hacked into the system and deactivated them.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Once you confirm this, feel around for the pistol hidden beneath the straps. If you can find it, please lower your gaze, look to the right, and blink twice. Then look straight ahead again.

I can feel that the restraints have indeed been deactivated and I follow her instructions.

I can now move freely, but I know it isn't time yet.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Understood, Commander. We'll be there in the interrogation room right away.

Calm T-Doll's voice: If these Nytos try to attack you before we get there, don't hesitate to fight back. They're only interrogator models and have no weapons or combat capabilities. I'm sure you can handle them.

Calm T-Doll's voice: By the way, don't forget our code. To acknowledge, please lift your gaze, look to the left, furrow your brows, then pull the right corner of your mouth downward. Oh, and stick out your tongue.

It's a bit challenging, but I do everything she asks...

Calm T-Doll's voice: A wonderful face. I've documented the image in retaliation for ruining my reputation in your story.

Calm T-Doll's voice: Now, please wait patiently. We still need a little bit more time.

I want to tell her I don't have much time left, but she's already ended the conversation.

On the other end of the Nyto's communicator, the owner of that male voice whose haughtiness is so apparent even through the digital distortion that he must be lying on a sofa right now, listening to a record player and staring at the ceiling. Then he'll casually read out my sentence.

What awaits me...what this "Father" wants to do to me...is quite obvious...

Distorted voice: ...So you're telling me, that there was no way for the Commander and all the other targets to have come into contact with Mastermind?

Nyto: Indeed. The evidence offers no contradiction from any aspect.

Distorted voice: Then we have no need for contradiction. Your work is over.

Nyto: What should we do with the commander?

Distorted voice: Do you have to ask? How many times have you done this already?

Distorted voice: Chop off the Commander's head and send it to me. Then destroy all evidence.

Distorted voice: Stand closer this time and put your back into the swing. Make it a clean cut and keep the head in good shape for my research.

Will my rescue not make it in time? The four Nytos are closing in with blades in hand!

I'm not sure other than the head, what other body parts would make effective targets. I must wait for them to come even closer so that I can get them all in the head in one go.

Commander:

Commander:

The four Dolls offer no response at all. They just keep walking towards me.

No...I can't make a move yet. They're not close enough. Just a bit closer!

Besides...I don't know which one...

The moment the Nytos raise their blades—

??: "I've brought misfortune."

...Bang! Bang, bang!

...

I aim my pistol at the last standing Nyto.

She gazes at me, but I don't pull the trigger because...

Commander: My motto has always been "treat ladies gently".

Nyto?: I told you you didn't have to respond to my code phrase.

Nyto?: But I like that reply. Looks like you know who we are.

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

Nyto under UMP45's control: I'm very honored to take part in this mission, Commander.
If choice 2 was picked

Nyto under UMP45's control: 416 is with me. Gr G11 and 9 are giving us off-site support. Don't worry, we'll get you out.
If choice 1 was picked

Somehow I doubt your sincerity.
If choice 2 was picked

I'm relieved to hear that. I suppose I can at least trust you as allies.

Nyto under UMP45's control: I would very much like to smile in response to that, but simply hacking into this Nyto is taking up all my processing capacity.

Nyto under UMP45's control: I can't do much about the face or the voice. Hope you don't mind.

The Nyto walks toward the entrance and studies the door.

Nyto under UMP45's control: They seem to take you very seriously. To keep this interrogation room under wraps, the door can only be opened from within, and the only ones with access are these Nytos.

Nyto under UMP45's control: Of course, we could've blasted it open from outside, but I didn't want to blow you to bits as well.

The Nyto fiddles with some mechanism, and the door opens with a creak.

Then a T-Doll walks in.

416: ...Looks like you're safe, Commander.

The calm T-Doll that has been corresponding with me was 416. Then the one in control of the Nyto...

UMP45: Nicely done, Commander.

UMP45: You managed to finish off three Nytos all by yourself under these circumstances.

UMP45: Now, let me add the finishing touch.

UMP45 executes the hacked Nyto with a bang.

UMP45: Your suffering is over.

Commander:

Commander:
If choice 1 was picked

UMP45: Like my new look? I don't think you get to see me too often.
If choice 1 was picked

416: Just give her some compliments. Who knows when we'll see each other again.
If choice 1 was picked

UMP45: The next time we meet, you'll probably have forgotten about me, or you won't dare remember me.

UMP45: But I'll be happy so long as you remember our secret code. Now, let's get on with the job.
If choice 2 was picked

416: We've kept you waiting, Commander. Can you still move?

416: Your stories were a bit over-the-top, but you didn't deserve such punishment...
If choice 2 was picked

416 walks up to me and looks a bit concerned. Either my mind is starting to get foggy, or the punishment really was that heavy...

UMP45: 416, hold the Commander up. We're getting out of here.

416: That's not going to be easy. Are they coming, 45?

UMP45: Of course. They won't give up the Commander just like that. Let's go! We should find somewhere to hide first!

...With the help of a brand new UMP45 and the same old 416, I stumble out of the interrogation room unsteadily.

At long last, I'm leaving this damn place, where I've spent god-knows-how many hours or days. But I can't help but look back at the remains of the Nytos in there...

...Remains? Or...?

I take in the fluid that looks exactly like blood and the body parts mangled by bullets.

What on earth...are "they"?

With my brain still addled by chemicals, all kinds of notions tumble around uncontrollably inside my head.

UMP45's hack could only last for a minute at a time?

RO mentioned something about fluid leaking out of their bodies after they got shot...?

And the voice that sounded both real and hollow...

I can't think straight. The sounds of gunshots, artillery fire, and UMP45's calls overlap in my mind as I gradually slip into oblivion...

What exactly have I achieved? Victory? Freedom? Or...an even deeper level of hell?

...The operation has dragged on for too long and the infection has spread all over Ange's body. Task Force DEFY is forced to abort the mission and make a swift escape.

AN-94: The contamination index in this area is falling! There must be a safe spot ahead!

AK-12: Hurry, Ange! Keep running! We're almost there!

...Heading towards something. That's what Ange has been doing all along.

AK-12: Ange?

...But she has never felt so lost before.

AN-94: Ange...

...Confusion, terror, hate. At the last moment...

...She lets go of all these things that she's been holding onto, so that she can get the one thing she wants right now.

Ange...

Angelia: GUARGHHHHHHH!!

...Death.

AK-12: Ange...

AK-12: I can't do this...

AN-94: Didn't you hear her, AK-12?

AN-94: She wants us...to kill her.

...

Angelia: Ugh...argh...

Angelia: GUARGHHHHH!!

AN-94: This is our final order. Come on.

...Bang, bang!

...Half an hour later, at a certain communications outpost.

AK-12: Commander, Ange's radiation sickness escalated and became rampant. We obeyed her dying wish and put her down.

AK-12: The rescue mission has ended in failure. AN-94 and I will bury Ange's body and self-destruct in 15 minutes.

AK-12: Please...withdraw the rescue party and leave the battlefield as soon as you can.

...End of transmission.

...Not another sound comes through the communicator...

...

Nyto: We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances.

Nyto: We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander.

Nyto: We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.

The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...

Nyto: Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes.

Nyto: So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.

I will tell them everything that comes to mind.

The lies, the truth. Let them guess.

I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.

Nyto: Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily.

Nyto: If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.

That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum.

How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story?

At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live...

...
...

...

What scant legacies we still possess, you left behind for us.

What convictions burned in your hearts when you first sacrificed yourselves?

What did you hope to gain when you decided to surrender control over your destinies?

...

Ange: Tell me, would you all have made the same decision if you saw how we are now?

Ange: ...

Ange: Perhaps the only one lesson that we, those who remain, have learned from your sacrifices...

Ange: ...Is that we will never, ever learn anything from them.

...Click.

AK-12: Ange, the lurking threats are on the move.

AK-12: Shall we continue surveillance?

Ange: ...

AK-12: Ange? Do you read me?

Ange: They're moving much faster than anything Statesec planned for.

Ange: And those bureaucrats... they won't ever consider the errors in orders they gave out from behind the desk.

AK-12: You mean you plan on using this opportunity to take the wind out of their sails?

Ange: ...

Ange: That's not the reason we came here. Nor are they the ones responsible for the choices we made.

Ange: Take 94 and link up with me. Get the team ready for action.

...The transmission ends.

Ange: M4.

M4A1: I'm here.

M4A1: What is this place? Ange, there's no need for us to be here during a surveillance operation.

Ange: It might be unnecessary...but that doesn't mean it's meaningless.

Ange: What is this place, according to your neural cloud?

M4A1: It's a memorial to the fallen. There are no clues or information around here.

M4A1: The world got worse and worse, even after wars upon wars. Their sacrifices were in vain.

Ange: This memorial to the fallen of the last war is enough of an answer.

Ange: A sacrifice is the final defense of one's beliefs. They died for what they believed in.

Ange: And we, the ones who lived, have no right to assign value to the sacrifices of others.

M4A1: I will not adjust my opinion in light of that.

Ange: ...

Ange: ...And you decided to interfere with Griffin's business with the same attitude?

Ange: You knew very well that what you did would only expose us prematurely.

M4A1: ...It's all for the sake of future operations.

Ange: But if it all comes to nothing in the end, are you willing to accept the fact that everything you did was in vain?

M4A1: I will not, nor is there a need to consider such a possibility.

Ange: M4...

Ange: ...

Ange: You're becoming more and more of a stranger to me.

M4A1: "Protect your friends in the AR Team no matter the cost, even if you have to sacrifice yourself."

M4A1: Weren't you the one who taught me this core principle?

Ange: ...

A bouquet of fresh flowers is laid before the memorial.

Ange: Things are different from how they used to be.

M4A1: Nothing's changed. It's just that you've become weak.

Ange: Ha, you don't quite seem to know the difference.

Ange: However, you'll probably begin to understand after this operation.

M4A1: Really?

M4A1: Do you know what's going to happen during this operation?

Ange: I don't, M4A1...

Ange: But it definitely won't be anything good, right?

M4A1: ...Aren't you the optimist.

Ange: The only good thing that can come of this is that we survive.

Ange: Do your best to achieve that, then you'll understand...

Ange: The meaning of sacrifice, and everything you see before you...

Ange: ...I assure you of that.

...

A hacker.

A spy.

An information broker.

Or perhaps a middleman for "the big shots."

K: Oh, and Commander? I know you're monitoring our conversation from your terminal.

K: I don't know what you look like, but from the way you handled the situation, I understand why you are feared by many.

K: However, while in this city, you won't want me as an enemy and vice versa - for the time being.

Perhaps he's one of those.

Or perhaps...he's all of them.

K: In any case, I give my regards.

K: Should I say..."A pleasure to meet you," or "Welcome to Belgrade"?

K: I've been waiting for you.

I dislike dealing with such people.

They'll help you, for a high price.

But you'll never know when they'll betray you for an even higher one.

...

K: Now then...

K: Angelia... Let me tell you about her adventures.

K: Where would you like me to start?

...The next day, in a secret Griffin safe house.

Kalina: Commander!

Kalina: Wake up, Commander!

RO635: Miss Kalina? Ah...still can't get the Commander out of the room?

Kalina: Yeah...it seems the Commander's still feeling down after that conversation with Mr. K yesterday.

RO635: I can understand how that feels, like it was all for nothing...

RO635: Even so, I took the briefcase as K asked. Should I begin analyzing the contents?

RO635: Or should we contact Miss Persica?

Kalina: The Commander asked us to put all activities on hold, so we probably shouldn't do anything until we get orders.

RO635: But it's almost time for the scheduled call with K. At this rate...

...The door suddenly opens.

Commander: Kalina, come to the comms room.

Kalina: Er... Yes, Commander!

Kalina: The signal's not too good... Ah, we're through!

Kalina: Commander, we can engage in encrypted comms on channel B-3-5F, and we can maintain comms secrecy for three minutes.

K: Commander, you're late. Not a good habit for a PMC to have.

Commander: ...

K: What's the matter? The look on your face suggests that you're quite unhappy with me.

K: According to my information, you've recalled all the Dolls you've dispatched to this safe house.

K: Should I interpret this as a form of disobedience?

Commander: As far as I know, the orders I received were to look for Ange.

K: Do you still think so, even after what happened yesterday?

K: "Find Ange"?

K: If you really believe that, then I'll have to look for another candidate.

Commander: Smuggling the HOCs and the Dolls past the border went too smoothly.

Commander: One would have to pay a huge price in order to make such a thing happen, and it's not something that money alone can cover. So there must be some reason why Griffin has to be here.

Commander: What that tells me is that you and your backers have no better choice than me. So you can either tell me more about Ange, or I can have my Dolls take a vacation until it's too late.

K: You're smart, Commander.

K: But I've already told you enough.

K: "Ange is not your enemy."

K: Just like I said yesterday.

Kalina: Of COURSE we know Miss Ange isn't our enemy!

Kalina: It's because she's not our enemy that we're so worried about her and want to find her!

K: Ah, Kalina, Griffin's veteran logistics officer.

K: You were an orphan and a drifter from a young age, which is why you place such great emphasis on money. Kryuger pitied you, and so he recruited you into Griffin despite you being underage at the time.

Kalina: ...

K: Normally, I'm not a fan of dealing with people who are too avaricious, because they'll sell themselves for the slightest bit of cash.

K: Would you betray the Commander beside you for money?

Kalina: Of course not!

K: Mm. Compared to your fake smile from just now, I find your genuine anger a lot cuter.

K: I believe that you won't, because everything has a price. In other words, a bargaining chip of commensurate value.

K: It's just like how every bit of information I provide must be paid for by you providing something of equal value to me.

Commander: You don't get to decide the equivalence of values all on your own. I'm not going to say this again. Griffin will not take any action before I gain more information.

K: Seeking mutual consensus is very good. It seems that on top of getting straight to the point, you're quite adept at negotiations, Commander. It would seem I will have to make a few concessions of my own.

Kalina: Please stop going around in circles, Mr. K. Shouldn't we be working together?

K: Your opinion is very constructive, so I will add another piece of information.

K: Ange the "traitor" is currently carrying out a mission not fitting of her "traitor" status. And as you know, she is currently in this very city.

K: She is alone save for her Doll squad, and the mission she is carrying out is, as always, extremely risky. Severely outnumbered, it is very likely that she will be swamped by the enemy if she does not receive support. And the people who were supposed to provide said support are enjoying a vacation in a cozy cabin...

Commander: ...

Kalina: ...

K: Here's another freebie. Her team contains Dolls who were once from the AR Team.

K: If my information is correct, they once operated under you. Am I correct, Griffin Commander?

Kalina: M4...? They're in Belgrade too?

Commander: ...

Commander: What do you need us to do now?

K: I like that pragmatic nature of yours, Commander.

K: I believe we will enjoy working together.

...Inside Griffin's safe house in Belgrade.

RO635: We were insulted by humans...trapped...almost drowned...

RO635: And we didn't even manage to find the enemy's true hiding place... If this keeps up...

M4 SOPMOD II: What are you talking about, RO?

M4 SOPMOD II: Quit moping over there, the clothes we washed yesterday are dry now. I'll put them here, along with your gear.

RO635: ...I really envy how you can be so relaxed in a situation like this.

RO635: Did you get a checkup afterwards? Did the water damage your body?

M4 SOPMOD II: Nope! I was on your shoulders all the time so I didn't get any water on me~

M4 SOPMOD II: When can we get fully waterproofed bodies, anyway?

RO635: I don't think that's possible in the short term...

M4 SOPMOD II: Then we'd better avoid the sewers from now on...

M4 SOPMOD II: If the Commander's forces had arrived any later, we might really have gone to a watery grave.

RO635: Actually, what bothers me more is the "guardian angel" that Mr. K was talking about...

RO635: They managed to open a door that even I couldn't remotely operate...

M4 SOPMOD II: So you're saying...someone else saved us yesterday?

RO635: I'm not too sure... Ah, hang on, there's an incoming transmission.

Kalina: Still there, RO? Could you bring that briefcase to the comms room? Also, the Commander said to let SOP-II come along as well.

RO635: Roger. Let's go, SOP-II. We've got a new mission.

RO635: What's this briefcase?

Kalina: We've activated it the way Mr. K told us to. What's this...

M4 SOPMOD II: What the heck...it's just a holographic map and a bunch of coordinates.

Kalina: There are way too many coordinates, no matter how you slice it... Do we really have to dispatch Dolls to each of them?

RO635: We have to send someone to every one of them? That would pretty much scatter them across the entire city, isn't this a bit too...

M4 SOPMOD II: Is that Mr. K's request? He's clearly treating us like tools! Does he want to turn us into walking security cameras?!

Kalina: (Groans) That said, he does have information on Ange, and everything we are about to do will help her.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ehhh? You've got news about Ange?!

Kalina: All we know is that "she's carrying out a mission in this city" and that she needs our help.

RO635: Ange...is also in Belgrade...?

RO635: So...our presence here isn't a coincidence...

M4 SOPMOD II: If Ange's here, then are M4 and AR-15 also...

M4 SOPMOD II: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: But if they're here, then why didn't they contact us?

M4 SOPMOD II: There are a lot of ways to communicate securely, right?

RO635: Don't get worked up, SOP-II.

RO635: As long as we do what we are supposed to, we'll meet them eventually.

M4 SOPMOD II: I just feel like...

M4 SOPMOD II: I haven't really thought about what I should say if I end up meeting the others again.

RO635: It's still too early to think about such things, SOP-II.

RO635: Also, what will we be doing next, according to Mr. K's plan?

Kalina: Er...um...disguise yourselves as humans, and chill...?

M4 SOPMOD II: So we're going to be walking security cameras after all!

...

P22: Hailing Commander, our forces are in position.

P22: We're preparing for the infiltration.

Lewis: We're in position too, haven't encountered any obstacles for the moment.

Lewis: Hehe, as I thought, humans don't go out of their way to give good-looking girls trouble.

Lewis: Still, are you sure we have to put away our weapons before entering the indicated district?

Lewis: It doesn't feel safe...

Kalina: The last two echelons are in position. That means everyone's reached their appointed coordinates, and their weapons have all been hidden away. What should we do next, Commander?

Commander: We'll wait for K's next request.

Kalina: Understood.

Kalina: Still, why would Mr. K want us to go to these places?

Kalina: They're all residential areas or shopping districts, it doesn't seem like there are any high-value targets there...

...Click.

K: Commander, you moved faster than I expected.

K: My opinion of Griffin has been favorably revised.

Kalina: No need to sweet-talk us at a time like this.

Kalina: I'm sure what we're doing isn't as simple as having a bunch of Tactical Dolls stand by the side of the road, am I correct?

K: I like I.O.P. products very much. Having one next to you feels like being in the company of a real person.

K: And sometimes, kindness can be a weapon in its own right.

Kalina: ...Is that why you asked the Dolls to hide their weapons, in order to make them look more like ordinary human beings?

K: That's because our enemy might be more human-like than us.

Kalina: So you're saying, the white enemies...are already lying in wait at those coordinates?

K: Commander, don't you need more information about Ange? Consider this operation the price for learning about her.

K: Find those white bastards and wipe them out before it's too late.

Kalina: But if the enemy's already infiltrated these streets, doesn't that mean they're already among the humans and the civilian Dolls?

Kalina: There's no way we can tell who's a hidden enemy under these conditions!

K: The briefcase contains a database containing the White Faction signal markers we've encountered so far. Send it to your Dolls.

K: Once you scan anyone who matches those markers, force a connection and fry their neural clouds.

K: If you meet any tricky opposition, let RO and SOP-II handle it. They should have enough experience with that after yesterday.

Commander: ...

Commander: How did you know that RO and SOP-II have experience in picking out hidden enemies?

K: Oh, don't frown at me like that, Commander. Obtaining information is my job.

K: Especially...information about you.
Part 2

2

...Inside the Belgrade safe house.

Marlohe: Commander, Miss Kalina, this way please.

Kalina: What is this place?

K: One of my safe houses.

K: You can set up your command post here for the duration of your operations in this city.

K: The equipment here will provide you ample transmission coverage to keep your HQ in contact with your Dolls throughout the city limits.

Kalina: I can't believe it... It's a Type 50 bidirectional low-frequency MSE-based transceiver system...and there're three of them!

Kalina: Closed-circuit signal jammers! Holy crap, every room's been fitted with them...

Kalina: Can that Mr. K really throw around military-grade equipment like this so casually...?

K: As long as it helps the mission.

K: Let Marlohe know if you have any other requests. She is at your service.

K: If there's nothing else, we'll speak again at our next scheduled communication.

K: I'll leave the rest to you, Marlohe.

Marlohe: Yes, Master.

Kalina: Mr. K might be stingy with his information, but he's really generous in other areas...

Marlohe: Miss Kalina, can I help you with anything?

Kalina: Ah, then, could you tell me about Ange?

Marlohe: No comment.

Kalina: Ah...as I thought, it didn't work...

Kalina: Eh, forget it. Miss Marlohe, please show us around this place, if you would.

Marlohe: Understood.

...

Marlohe: This is the ammunition storage room.

Marlohe: The toilet is ahead and to the right.

Kalina: There are just too few toilets here...not enough for everyone.

Marlohe: May I remind you that Dolls do not have the biological need to use the bathroom.

Kalina: ...

Kalina: ...I know that! I'm talking about our logistics staff!

Marlohe: I would advise against letting too many people learn the location of this safe house. The other Griffin personnel can remain in the prior location.

Kalina: Humph... Alright...

Marlohe: Let us proceed to the next area.

Marlohe: This central room contains the MSE system hub, with a double-redundant emergency power supply here and here. You can observe the network from here, and I have already forwarded the interface and transmission network blueprints to you.

Kalina: Huh...so you could install them like this...

Kalina: Can I try modifying this equipment now?

Marlohe: Certainly. I can assist you.

Kalina: Alright! That way it'll be much more versatile!

Kalina: Thank you, Miss Marlohe. I didn't expect your database to contain so many plans!

Marlohe: Don't mention it.

Kalina: This way, the layout will be close to what it was in the base, which means it'll be easier for the Commander to use too.

Marlohe: If there is nothing else, I will enter standby mode.

Kalina: Wait! Wait a minute! Let's have a chat!

Marlohe: A chat?

Kalina: Yes, yes!

Marlohe: What shall we chat about?

Kalina: Ah...er...um...

Marlohe: If there is nothing of great importance, I will enter standby mode.

Kalina: Wait!

Kalina: Ah, yes...that's right, Miss Marlohe, what is Mr. K usually like?

Marlohe: I don't quite understand what you mean.

Kalina: That is to say...what kind of person is he like most of the time?

Kalina: For instance...do people usually visit him?

Marlohe: Secrecy is our mantra. Nobody would come to our door.

Kalina: Then does Mr. K speak with you?

Marlohe: Master needs to spend a great deal of time every day on collecting and analyzing information.

Marlohe: He does not waste time on frivolous interaction.

Kalina: Eh...but withdrawing from others isn't a good way to treat yourself...

Kalina: Surely there must be a limit to how deeply you can immerse yourself in work, right?

Marlohe: Thank you for your concern.

Marlohe: However, Master lives a very regimented life, and his health status is also strictly monitored.

Kalina: Regimented?

Marlohe: Master has arranged a schedule for himself.

Marlohe: He is very precise in his activities and daily life and does not leave any openings. Nor does he waste any time or energy. Everything must be kept at maximum efficiency.

Kalina: He can't be off, not even for a second?

Marlohe: Not even for a second.

Kalina: That feels a little frightening...

Kalina: Don't tell me Mr. K is just an A-Doll who only knows how to work?

Kalina: Ahaha... I was just kidding...

Marlohe: Please take those words back.

Kalina: Huh?

Marlohe: Even if Master controls his life with absolute precision, he is not an emotionless machine.

Marlohe: He simply acts in a way that will protect everyone, even if others do not understand his method.

Marlohe: Therefore I will not tolerate any criticism about the Master.

Kalina: I...I'm sorry...

Marlohe: Someday you will understand too.

Marlohe: If there is nothing else, please permit me to take my leave.

Kalina: Al...alright...

Marlohe leaves.

Kalina: Really... A misunderstood method...

Kalina: Perhaps other than our standpoints, we're not so different after all...

Kalina: Phew...

Kalina: It took a bit of doing, but on the whole, this temporary command post looks pretty good.

Commander: You've finished already?

Kalina: I did my best to give this place the same functionality as the command room in our base. I also made some small changes so that we can communicate with the outside world in a more secure transmission mode.

Commander: So you're saying we can talk to Persica?

Kalina: I think you shouldn't contact Persica for the time being. She's probably under very heavy surveillance right now...

Commander: How about the others?

Kalina: I've been negotiating with WAVE Corporation. While they're an information agency that Mr. Witkiny recommended, they seem a little suspicious. Still, it's not like we have any better choices right now...

Commander: I reckon that means you're onto something.

Kalina: Yes. In fact, I was looking for you to tell you about it.

Kalina: WAVE helped us gather some information, and while it was pricey...it was worth it.

Commander: Hm, care to share?

Kalina: Do you remember what Mr. Witkiny said before...about how this mission was given to us by a member of Statesec?

Kalina: At first, I thought that Mr. K was a Statesec agent or something, but it was only after I looked through the information that I realized...we really are quite low on the food chain...

Kalina: K isn't an employee of Statesec, at least not according to their personnel manifest. So to Statesec, we're just...subcontractors of a subcontractor.

Commander: A glove over another glove, huh...

Kalina: Ange aside, Statesec is also taking official action in this city. There's going to be a very important bilateral summit taking place in three days, so it's easy to see why Mr. K wants us to clear out the infiltration of the White Faction's Dolls...

Commander: That was the meeting they were talking about on TV earlier, right...

Kalina: Correct, but there's something weird about it all...

Kalina: This operation in Belgrade - both the officially dispatched agents as well as the people liaising with K - didn't originate from the Bureau HQ, but the Sixth Directorate of Internal Security.

Commander: The Sixth Directorate?

Commander: But if I'm not wrong, the Ninth Directorate is in charge of diplomatic protection work...right?

Kalina: Precisely. Sixth Directorate mainly handles top secret cases involving cutting-edge technology and national-defense industries.

Kalina: That's why it's so weird!

Kalina: Why would they need to send people from the Sixth Directorate just to provide security for a summit?

Kalina: Why is K in Belgrade, acting on the orders of a department that deals with top-secret technology?

Kalina: And what does all of this have to do with Ange?

Commander: ...

Commander: I'll remember this.

Commander: Did you find anything related to Ange?

Kalina: Yeah...

Kalina: But everything I could dig up didn't go into much depth.

Kalina: Most of it was combat records from when she was seconded to Griffin as a commander in the past, except for this one...

...Click.

The attempt to read the file fails.

Commander: Is it...corrupted?

Kalina: It's not corrupted. Judging from the details, it looks like someone deleted the information.

Commander: This time period...it's a log of Ange's activities from before and after Operation Butterfly...

Commander: Can you or WAVE recover the file?

Kalina: I've already tried...

Kalina: But since the information was deliberately destroyed, there's pretty much no way to restore it.

Commander: ...

...In the middle of the night.

I'm sitting at my place, contemplating Kalina's findings as well as everything about this city.

Commander: ...

Commander: (K is the middleman between Statesec and us, which means K is on the same side as Statesec.)

Commander: (But does K truly know what Statesec's real objective is?)

Commander: (Or are we all nothing but pawns?)

What role did Ange play in all of this?

If everything was as K said and Ange is still carrying out the mission given to her by Statesec, then why did Statesec prepare a card like me?

Am I to assist her...

Or to monitor her?

And if Ange really does defy the orders given to her by Statesec... then what role does K play?

...Someone knocks on the door.

Kalina: Not asleep yet, Commander?

Commander: Oh, I'm almost about to.

Commander: Right now, it's just... I can't stop thinking about a few things.

Kalina: All-nighters are bad for your health, you know.

Kalina: Here, I've warmed up some milk, drink it while it's hot!

Commander: Mm...thanks.

Kalina: Miss Marlohe allowed me to query their database, so I've been searching for useful information all this while.

Kalina: I rushed over because I stumbled upon something.

Kalina: Still...you really were thinking about Ange after all, weren't you?

Commander: ...Yeah, all of this is just weird, no matter how you slice it.

Commander: It feels like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle and I can't link it all together.

Kalina: It's all because K controls all the information and he won't reveal anything!

Kalina: While he keeps saying he'll tell us more after we complete our mission, he's either been playing dumb or feeding us irrelevant things up till now.

Kalina: I don't believe that he'll explain it all to us after we've finished everything!

Commander: Even so, we need to play our part.

Commander: If he wants obedient tools, then we'll do as he says in principle.

Kalina: But even if we do that...

...Kalina and I both fall silent.

Commander: Ugh, for now, let's set aside these problems we can't understand.

Commander: I also found more detailed information about the upcoming summit.

Commander: This is the local paper from last night.

—"In light of the upcoming international summit, the municipal authorities have announced 17 new security ordinances in order to ensure the safety of the meeting's opening ceremony..."

Kalina: Belgrade... It's considered neutral territory on the European political map, so if there are bilateral talks, they'll be held here, and the Neo-Soviet Union and the United Nations will have ambassadors representing them.

Kalina: This city is beyond the reach of either sides' influence, so a lot of thought must have gone into picking this place.

Commander: Neutral, huh... Trust is as hard to build as ever. Granted, they can avoid political pressure from both sides on neutral ground. However, the downside is that it's very easy for people who don't want the summit to infiltrate this place...

Kalina: That's true...

Kalina: I also heard some rumors that there were some plans to join the United Nations on our side, but the idea of allying with old enemies was met with extreme backlash within the country. Perhaps people don't love peace as much as they say they do...

Commander: It's not easy to shake hands with a mortal enemy.

Commander: And to some people, a world in conflict better serves their interests.

Kalina: Ugh...it's so confusing...

Commander: Apart from that...did you find anything else?

Kalina: Oh, I almost forgot!

Kalina: Commander, take a look at this!

...Kalina dumps a pile of documents on the desk.

Commander: Let me see...

Commander: Special columns and reviews...

Commander: The United Nations clarifies its anti-war stance...but the dates are all...

Kalina: They're from the event 2 years ago commemorating the 10th anniversary of the end of World War III..

Kalina: K dug up a lot of articles from that period. He always made special note of things like these that you could find anywhere.

Commander: ...

Commander: "Rossartrism".

Kalina: That's right... They're all activities linked to Rossartrism.

Commander: I've heard that the Rossartrists were behind the formation of the United Nations and they were even tied to the end of WWIII.

Commander: Still, there's nothing surprising about him collecting these. While K didn't go out and take part in political activities, it seems he has a political stance of his own.

Commander: That said, I don't understand why someone like him would choose to support such an extreme ideology.

Kalina: I think I've found the reason why K chose us... take a look at this.

Commander: This is...

Kalina: By May, 25 members of the United Nations will have declared their wish to embrace Rossartrism.

Kalina: Public support of governments which practice Rossartrism is in excess of 70%.

Kalina: A new common destiny will soon be born, and mankind will soon set foot into a new era of faith and mutual aid.

Kalina: High-ranking officials of the United Nations have announced more initiatives to progress mankind, and to that end they have already prepared to become a cutting edge of a newer world.

Commander: Wait, what was that...?

Kalina: Yeah... I was really surprised when I saw it too.

Commander: "A newer world..."

Kalina: "The cutting edge of a newer world."

Kalina: That's the slogan of the Rossartrist movement.

Kalina: They were using it long before Griffin did.

Commander: ...

Kalina: Spreading Rossartrism is prohibited within the nation, so we know almost nothing about it...

Kalina: I have no idea why Mr. Kryuger would use this for Griffin's slogan...

Commander: ...

Commander: Let's end it here for today.

Kalina: Huh?

Commander: Thinking about this won't help, and we still have a mission to carry out tomorrow. Let's call it a night.

Kalina: That...that's true. I'll go sleep, then. Goodnight, Commander.

...

...I had stopped the conversation in its tracks because the anxiety and uneasiness I felt was worse than when the Nytos were observing me on my sickbed.

Commander: "The cutting edge of a newer world..." Huh.

Commander: What forces could have guided things to this juncture...

Commander: Perhaps all this is more complicated and more frightening than I can imagine.
Part 3

...Mission accomplished.

Kalina: Commander, judging by the signals, we've wiped out the last enemies in hiding.

Kalina: But we couldn't find any more clues about the White Faction on their bodies.

Kalina: I've already sent over the data we've collected.

Commander: Is that so...

Commander: It seems we'll need to count on K in order to unravel this mystery.

...Click.

K: Neatly done, Commander.

K: Objectively speaking, there are few people with your level of operational efficiency. I have to say that it's left quite an impression.

Kalina: Humph, we've done what you've asked of us.

Kalina: Don't you think it's time to honor the promise you've made?

Kalina: At the very least, can you explain what this mission is all about?

K: You've made it perfectly clear that you can complete a task well even without knowing the details behind it.

K: However, I'll make an exception on account of the passable results of this task... What do you want to know?

Kalina: The briefcase you gave RO... The signal marker database inside it allowed us to accurately pinpoint the Dolls in hiding.

Kalina: Since you had the ability to find them, why didn't you take care of them yourself?

K: Someone's responsible for finding them, and you're responsible for exterminating them. That's the principle. Passing the information on to you via the database was just a secure means of communication.

Kalina: And did we purge the White Factions' infiltrators in order to secure the safety of the upcoming bilateral talks?

K: Yes.

Commander: ...And here I thought you'd have denied or tried to hide it

K: You would have guessed it, even if I hadn't said anything, so there was no harm in telling you.

Kalina: Why didn't you send out more professional security personnel since it's such an important summit? Surely Statesec's better at this than PMCs like us.

K: That's because someone believes you can do a better job than Statesec.

Kalina: What...

K: ...

K: We're not inside our country. We're not even within a country that's under our control.

K: If we're even the slightest bit careless here in anything we do, it might trigger a diplomatic disaster.

K: Therefore they cannot — and they will not — act rashly.

K: What we need are people who can conceal their identities and who are also capable of eliminating the enemy.

K: What you said earlier was right; there's no better choice than you for the job.

Kalina: In that case, how about telling us about Ange...

K: Being the best choice doesn't mean you get to make any demands

K: We have other plans in place even without you. Nobody is irreplaceable.

Kalina: Tsk...

Commander: I understand our position, and we're doing our best to keep our side of the bargain.

Commander: I don't mind not asking about Ange now, but I have another question.

K: Today's Q&A session is over.

Commander: Even if this question could determine the success or failure of the entire operation?

K: ...

Commander: Are the people you want us to purge really from the White Faction?

Commander: At first, I thought they had spread out and hidden because they were preparing to unleash a wave of city-wide devastation.

Commander: But as we uncovered more of their ambush positions, I realized they did not follow that logic.

Commander: Their deployment was extremely sloppy, and even if they wanted to take action, they lacked coordination among themselves and were easily isolated and destroyed.

Commander: When we launched an electronic warfare offensive to eliminate the infiltrating enemy units, they couldn't mount any effective resistance. They could not even find the origin of the Dolls which launched the attack.

Commander: But the technology and equipment they used definitely belong to the White Faction. That's what I find the most disturbing.

Commander: If they really were units from the White Faction, then they were being far too amateurish.

K: Perhaps that's all there is to them.

Commander: In my experience, it's not a good sign when an operation goes too well.

K: Overestimating the enemy is just as bad a habit as underestimating them, Commander.

Commander: If this meeting isn't so important, we wouldn't be standing here. If the meeting really is that important, then the White Faction wouldn't have sent a bunch of rabble over. That leaves only one conclusion...the true threat is not among these enemies.

K: I will convey your opinion to my client.

Commander: There's still time to call for reinforcements from StateSec.

K: No help will come from within the country.

Commander: What? Why?! Do you intend to stand by and watch as the peace summit is ruined?

K: Even if this is an important meeting, there is no real meaning behind the meeting itself.

K: The true meaning lies in the change of opinions behind the meeting.

K: There is nothing that cannot be sacrificed and nothing that cannot be forgotten.

K: You're smart, Commander. Sometimes, knowing less will help you live a little longer.

Commander: ...

K: That's all for today, go get some rest. There will be far more arduous tasks ahead of you.
Part 4

...Inside the Belgrade safe house.

Lewis: S.F. Dolls...they're average.

Lewis: Military automatons...they're so ugly they make me sick.

Lewis: Now, these White Faction infiltrator Dolls...they look the best.

Lewis: But why is it that these White Faction Dolls are the most troublesome ones to handle?!

P22: There's no end to the missions we're running outside, I can't believe you've still got the strength to complain so much.

Lewis: I can't help it, I feel bad about opening fire on targets that move my heart!

Lewis: First it was the high-end S.F. Dolls, and now these...

P22: What are you so sad about? Either those beautiful targets get disfigured, or you do. Feel free to take your pick.

P22: If you want to blame someone, then blame mankind for making such pretty things do jobs like this.

Lewis: Humans or Dolls, why won't they just sit down and talk things out...

Lewis: A lot of things wouldn't have to be so complicated if only people had more patience!

P22: They wouldn't?

P22: Do you think your enemies are also that naive?

Lewis: But—

X95: Ladies, are you really not going to use this time to get some rest?

X95: We'll be very busy over the next few days.

P22: I just can't help it, X95.

P22: Her Grace over here doesn't know how the world works yet.

...P22 stretches her body from where she's sitting on the sofa.

Lewis: Humph! I just don't get it!

Lewis: Besides, I don't understand why people still love to fight even though everyone knows that bloody conflicts are bad!

Lewis: And fighting would be one thing, but ruining such pretty faces—

X95: Ugh...

X95: Lewis, very often people don't choose to fight because they want to, but because they have to.

X95: Would you be so opposed to a war if it could compel two enemies to sit down and talk out their differences?

Lewis: But there'll be lots of unhappiness as long as there's war.

Lewis: It shouldn't be worthwhile!

P22: Isn't that why humans use Dolls to bleed on their behalf?

P22: From that point of view, you ought to be glad that you're a Doll, Your Worship.

X95: You don't need to put it that way, Miss P22...

Lewis: But they're just making us handle all the things they don't want to face!

Lewis: The source of the problem hasn't been dealt with at all.

X95: Many things are like that. Perhaps these problems may never be resolved.

X95: Humans passed those things on to us because very often, they, too, had to bear a lot of problems which didn't belong to them...

Lewis: Since it's not their problem, they should just ignore it...

X95: The problems left over from the past can't be abandoned so easily. That's the price of human progress.

X95: Too many people have had to bear the hatred of others from birth, even if both parties will never, ever meet.

X95: And blind hatred...eventually results in war.

Lewis: But how can everyone be so blind?!

Lewis: Surely any of their leaders...no, any one of them with some sense would know this is completely illogical, right?

Lewis: So why don't they choose to stop it?

P22: Hehe, it's not just that they didn't stop it, but the smartest humans even gave it a grand-sounding title.

P22: People nowadays are more inclined to call these leftover problems from the past "nationalism".

X95: I think the most ironic thing is that in the end, the only thing that can calm these people down is war.

X95: ..."It is well that war is so terrible, or we should grow too fond of it."

Lewis: ...

Lewis: (Sighs) Why isn't there a button that can wipe away all hatred with a push...

Lewis: Then we wouldn't need to keep going round in circles...

P22: It's hard to say if everyone wants such a thing.

P22: Would you be willing to reach an understanding with S.F. Dolls?

Lewis: I don't have any basis for this, but I feel that the high-end S.F. Dolls aren't bad people.

Lewis: There must have been some misunderstanding which led to them becoming the way they are now.

P22: Even if you think it's possible, how many of us would be able to accept that point of view?

P22: These are the same S.F. Dolls that have been wrecking our comrades out there, you know.

Lewis: How can I answer that?!

Lewis: I'm just a Doll, if S.F. destroys me, then just send me back to IOP for repairs.

Lewis: Ugh...my head hurts...

Lewis: Why do we have to discuss this...

P22: That's why I think we should just be good Dolls and not think too much. Leave the complicated questions for the big shots to worry about.

P22: Besides...we're just tools that mankind use to achieve their goals.

P22: Just like how they gain the most benefit for themselves by ravaging this world...

...

...Upstairs in the safe house.

HS2000: Seems like the people downstairs have piped down at last...

HS2000: Why do they need to talk about things that have nothing to do with them the moment they get inside...

HS2000: Isn't it much more comfy to just lie down and watch TV?

KSVK: When a soul is beset by confusion and doubt, it is only natural that it becomes aggressive.

KSVK: Suspicion is simply a way to express an attack.

HS2000: I don't quite get it...

HS2000: Still, their discussion was drowning out the sound of the program. I can finally watch TV in peace now.

HS2000: But the programs here are more boring than I imagined... I thought Griffin's video archives were outdated enough, but I didn't expect that there would be a place that's even worse.

KSVK: Be content with the fact that you've got something to watch... You're lucky that you weren't picked for electronic warfare duties or whatever, where your brain can get burned up if you're even the slightest bit careless.

HS2000: We don't have brains... Those are neural clouds, dear, neural clouds...

"We interrupt this program to bring you an urgent weather report..."

HS2000: And now I can't even watch TV...

"A thunderstorm will strike Belgrade within the next 48 hours. The purification towers are at Level Four alert and the trains on the Intercontinental Railway in or out of the city have been cancelled."

"Due to the recent surge in Collapse Fluid levels, the storm may bring intense radiation contamination. Citizens must cease all outdoor activities for the next two days."

"If an emergency situation arises, please contact the following departments—"

HS2000: What does this warning mean...

HS2000: Is this something we should care about? Are we going to have a vacation?

KSVK: Given the content, it seems to be aimed at the local population. In other words...only the humans.

KSVK: I don't think this will affect us in carrying out our mission.

KSVK: We're made of materials that are highly resistant to radiation. That was why we were chosen to come here.

HS2000: Which means we still need to go outside and find the White Faction Dolls, then...

HS2000: Ugh... I don't want to go outdoors in hazardous weather...

KSVK: The challenges which take you out of your comfort zone will eventually become your weapons.

HS2000: But I don't wanna leave my comfort zone...

HS2000: Ehhhh... I hate this... Can't I get a weaker body, the kind with which I can get paid just for being cute...?

KSVK: Destiny will not take pity on your weakness.

KSVK: Your wish will only lead to you being wrecked in battle.

HS2000: Ehhhh, you're so cold...

HS2000: Still, even if I get wrecked, I can still be fixed. I don't have to die outside even in crappy weather like this. Suddenly, being a Doll doesn't seem so bad after all.
Part 5

...The third day after the beginning of the extermination operation.

...Click.

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander—!

M4 SOPMOD II: Are we done yet?!

Commander: And by done you mean...?

M4 SOPMOD II: We've been scanning, pinpointing and burning the enemy for the past few days...then we scan, pinpoint and burn the enemy again...and the enemy can't really fight either...

M4 SOPMOD II: Doing this sort of thing over and over again...it gets really boring.

Commander: I've been looking at monitors all day long myself, I feel like I'm about to go blind.

Commander: You're at Position 44, right? Things are almost wrapped up there, as long as you and RO...

M4 SOPMOD II: RO's getting bored too!

M4 SOPMOD II: "Besides, after 44 there'll be 54 and 64," she said.

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhh! Quit pulling on me like that, RO!

RO635: I-I never said that!

Commander: Calm down.

Commander: According to K's information, we've almost finished wiping out the enemy's infiltrators.

Commander: So now all we need to do is wait for his...

...Click.

Commander: As I thought.

Commander: RO, SOP-II, head back to the safe house first.

RO635: It's over?

RO635: It's really over?

...

K: In terms of pure efficiency, you were eight hours quicker than I expected.

Commander: So, is the mission over?

Commander: I'm still waiting for my forces to report in.

K: This is a combat feedback report from a Statesec field agent team.

K: The information I'm giving you was prepared by professionals, so you can rest easy accepting it.

Commander: If that agent team can pinpoint the enemy so precisely, would they mind going ahead and taking them out while they're at it?

K: I told you before, their job is surveillance, yours is extermination. Those are the rules of the game.

Commander: So the agent team is your alternative plan, then.

K: One of them.

Commander: Thank you very much for passing me this piece of information.

Commander: But more than that, I'd like to know Ange's current situation.

K: You'll see her soon.

K: Wait for an update from me.

...The transmission ends.

Commander: ...

Kalina: Commander! Breaking news!

Kalina: The other four infiltrator units gave their reports, all the information we have suggests that the White Faction units have been completely wiped out!

Kalina: Now this entire city district is safe!

Commander: Yeah, K already told me.

Kalina: Ehh... You already knew...?

Commander: Call back the echelons that have finished their tasks so they can rest. Have the backup echelons who are standing by take up watch positions.

Commander: Don't let your guard down, everyone. Even if we appear to have wiped out the enemy, there might still be lurking threats.

Kalina: Got it—!

...Kalina leaves.

Commander: (Have they all been wiped out?)

Commander: (The White Faction didn't offer any proper resistance right till the end... but even after asking RO to widen her scanning radius, I couldn't find any remaining signals... Are they really so helpless against us?)

...I sweep my gaze over the dozens of monitor feeds before my eyes, trying to find some trace of armed White Faction troops hiding among them.

But that is not possible, the streets of Belgrade are far too peaceful.

Cars travel back and forth, and the streets are filled with throngs of happy, contented citizens.

Perhaps I could tell how many plainclothes police officers there were at a glance, but I can't tell who's a White Faction Doll in hiding.

...As that thought crosses my mind, a familiar figure suddenly appears in the crowd.

Commander: That's...

...A girl with a familiar face looks up and smiles at the camera.

...Then she vanishes into the masses.

Commander: Ny...

...She's smiling, a smile that says that she has the situation completely under control.

Are our operations at risk of being exposed?

Is that really the case? Were those enemies just a cover-up while we remain ignorant of the true threat?

No, that's impossible, if that really is the case, then how could K and Statesec not have realized this? Don't they have any countermeasures in place?

Am I seeing things? Do I make mistakes like that?

As my thoughts reach that point, I feel a chill running down my spine.

...Click.

K: I know you're not happy with our deliberate reluctance to turn over information on Ange to you, but unbeknownst to anyone, Ange has given too much of herself for the sake of the upcoming matter, and we can't let her sacrifice be in vain.

K: The next and final task you will receive is the true reason why we chose to work with Griffin.

K: We have made the appropriate arrangements. Once your task is complete, you will meet with Ange.

...

Commander: So what does Statesec want us to do?

K: You're a PMC. This part should be familiar.

Commander: The small fry outside have been taken care of. That means what comes next is the main event.

Commander: You want us to join the security team for the peace conference, don't you?

K: I can't keep anything from you, can I, Commander?

K: But you're still considered a reserve force among the security detail. Don't get carried away.

Commander: If it's already decided that we are to protect our country's ambassador, then what does Statesec want us to do?

K: Our country's ambassador?

K: Didn't I tell you not to get carried away just now? You aren't qualified to join the ambassador's bodyguards.

K: ...These are the details of your client this time round.

...Click.

Commander: ...

Commander: Wait a minute, this is...

K: Griffin doesn't need to worry about our ambassador.

K: She, on the other hand...is the client who will be in your care.
Part 6

6

...

...The morning of the summit.

0600.

Security Guard: Step forward, please present your identification.

...

Security Guard: Reporters, please take the press entrance and proceed straight ahead.

...

I pass through layer after layer of chain link fences and barricades.

...After going past the grim-faced police officers and MPs outside, I finally set foot on the staircase leading to the conference hall.

"We don't need Rossartre and his lackeys!"

"Get the fuck out of our city, you extremist executioners!"

All manner of gigantic slogan-bearing banners are visible among the protestors outside the conference hall.

A huge number of protestors have already gathered here before the start of the meeting, and they are locked in an intense standoff with the shield-bearing MPs of Belgrade.

Commander: Terrible weather, terrible crowds, what a terrible day this is.

I look up at the overcast sky and think about the thunderstorm which has been forecasted to grace the city today. Hopefully the city's purification towers will be able to do their job.

...After looking one last time at the noisy confrontation outside, I enter the hall.

Kalina: Commander! Over here!

Commander: Where are the others?

Kalina: (Whispers) The infiltration team used the fake IDs from K and entered successfully.

Kalina: RO and SOP-II are leading the other teams. As ordered, they're monitoring the situation from the surveillance points around the conference hall.

Commander: We don't know who around us is friend or foe, so we'll refer to the White Faction as the "hidden threat".

Kalina: Ah, alright.

Kalina: Everyone's taken the positions which K indicated in his request and they're all waiting for your orders. The interior looks safe, but the crowd outside, on the other hand...

Commander: Don't worry. The MPs of this city will maintain order outside. All we need to do is to make sure the hidden threat hasn't snuck inside.

Commander: Once the summit begins, the police will disperse those people by force.

Kalina: But once they begin driving the crowd away, a conflict will surely break out...

Kalina: I'm worried the enemy will attack the conference hall during the confusion.

Commander: We shouldn't need to worry about the defenses of this place. The MPs here have ample firepower to provide protection.

Commander: If a riot breaks out, let the surveillance teams break up the hidden threat's organized strength on the outside.

Commander: Keep all team leaders on alert and make sure they do their part. Don't attract suspicion.

...

...0700 in the morning.

...As time passes, the conference hall soon fills up with people.

Kalina: Commander, look at the entrance.

Kalina: Something seems to be going on there...

...Not far off, the guards at the entrance are vetting contingents seeking to enter the conference hall strictly.

It is obvious that the visitors are very unhappy with what the guards are doing.

Security Trooper: Nobody is allowed to carry weapons inside the conference hall! Either hand over your weapons or get lost and get out of the way!

Agent: What nonsense are you talking, Class A permits allow us to bring weapons into the venue, it says so clearly in the agreement!

Security Trooper: I've never seen any such agreement and orders are orders!

Kalina: While it's not like I don't understand why... But that checkpoint's being really overzealous in their security checks.

Kalina: Don't tell me they discovered some new threat...

Commander: No...it doesn't look like there's any threat. Those gate guards are just giving the Statesec agents a hard time.

Kalina: Am I missing something? Aren't both sides working to protect the meeting?

Kalina: Why are they still butting heads when the meeting's about to begin...

Commander: The master of this house doesn't seem to like some of the guests, nobody's to blame for that.

Kalina: Urgh...so you're saying it's because of bad historical relationships...

Kalina: Even without the disturbance outside, can a peace conference like this really proceed "peacefully"?

Commander: We shouldn't be worrying about that.

Commander: I just hope the Statesec agents won't focus all their attention on those friendly and welcoming security troopers.

Commander: Something's wrong in the conference hall.

Kalina: Huh?

Commander: X95, do you read me?

X95: Your orders, Commander?

Commander: How's your situation?

X95: Everything's going as planned, apart from the fact that posing as a waitress Doll is a little uncomfortable...

Commander: Bear with it for a little longer.

Commander: Have you verified that all the corridors inside the conference hall are clear?

X95: Yes, I'm sending over the corridor and route information. Other than the normal, guarded corridors, 90% of the emergency exits have been locked down. Half of them are metal fire doors and I visually estimate that one would need in excess of 800 grams of explosive to wreck them. While that might have been done for security purposes, this method of sealing off the exit might lead to the personnel being unable to evacuate swiftly if something happens inside.

Commander: Received. Continue gathering information.

X95: Yes, Commander.

Commander: Other than the corridors being under control, the deployment of security details throughout the building makes no sense. There are too few personnel inside, and most of them are concentrated at the entrances for vetting. In addition, I can't see our Statesec agents.

Kalina: Could the lack of manpower here be due to the original staff being assigned other duties? Maybe they'll come back later?

Kalina: And sealing off the exits can also be interpreted as them wanting to avoid outsiders getting in... Aren't you being too nervous, Commander?

Commander: I don't know.

Commander: But at the very least, I can't think of a logical motive behind these security arrangements.

Kalina: Then...should I report this to K?

Commander: ...There's no way he would have overlooked these details.

Commander: We can't tell what he's thinking, but we have to assume the worst to give ourselves some leeway.

Commander: X95, your original area of responsibility will now be handled by people from Lewis' team. Reposition downstairs and prepare yourself to curb any situations that break out inside.

X95: Yes, understood.

Lewis: Commander, the United Nations convoy has arrived. The VIP is entering the conference hall.

Commander: Can you verify her identity?

Lewis: I can confirm that she is indeed Gilda Ulrich, Chairwoman of the Pan-European Cooperation Initiative's Executive Committee... Let me take a look at her details.

Lewis: West German, born in 2029. In '52, she was apparently involved in the Weihnachtsmärkt Incident at the border that nearly developed into a violent conflict and kept a confrontation between the people and Soviet troops from turning bloody.

Lewis: As one of the few females on the executive committee, Gilda has gained the trust of her superiors and colleagues with her mature and calm methods as well as her efficiency.

Lewis: In '63, the former executive committee Chairman Weldon Kurz was forced to resign his post due to heart disease, and with the backing of the council, this young and capable member of the executive committee assumed the weighty responsibility of Chairwoman.

Lewis: As the lady official who single-handedly shoulders the burden of coordinating the economic institutions of Europe and elaborating on the Pan-European Reconstruction Plan, Gilda Ulrich is merely 34 years old.

Lewis: Uwah, she's a chairwoman at such a young age...

Lewis: It's exactly like the information Mr. K provided... Looks like she's a very dependable woman.

Lewis: Ah...the protestors outside the conference hall are starting to get agitated.

Lewis: From where I'm looking, it appears that they're planning to charge the MPs' defensive line...

Kalina: Has it...already begun...

Commander: The hidden threat might use this opportunity to take action. Everyone, stay alert.

Commander: All surveillance posts, report in.

Lewis: This is bad! We have a situation here!

Lewis: There's a human in a balaclava moving through the crowd from the outside, and he seems to be holding an explosive!

Lewis: Uh, permission to open fire? Oh no, he's almost at the defense line!

Lewis: He—

BOOM!

There is a tremendous explosion!

Commander: What happened?! What's going on outside!

Kalina: Commander— Ow (a burst of piercing static rings out from the earpiece)

Kalina: Our comm signals are being jammed!

Commander: They've begun their information lockdown. The following scenes are not fit for worldwide broadcast. Switch over to the backup circuit. It seems the Zener-only internal comms that K prepared for us are about to see use.

Kalina: Already on it, switching over to the pre-planned circuit... Alright, comms for all the teams are back to normal!

Kalina: The surveillance teams are reporting a terrorist attack outside! A suicide bomber blew himself up at the door to the conference hall!

Kalina: Number of MP casualties are unknown!

P22: Commander!

P22: A truck broadcasting hidden threat signals has appeared in the back streets and it's driving towards the conference hall at high speed.

P22: No, wait...there are high-speed vehicles coming from all directions! I've spotted nine of them; ETA is roughly three minutes!

Commander: As I thought, they weren't going to give up without a fight.

K: Commander.

Commander: I figured you'd contact me around now.

Commander: We've spotted the mobile targets moving in from the outside, shall we destroy them all?

K: You're responsible for the three roads behind the conference hall. The Statesec field agent team will handle the rest.

Commander: Can't let us take all the credit...is that it?

K: You'll get what you want. Now get to work.

RO635: Is it going to start at last?

RO635: The White Faction...

M4 SOPMOD II: No matter what they're plotting, all we have to do is wreck every single person who tries to come close!

M4 SOPMOD II: Hehe, we've done too many boring missions, now it's time for a real workout!

Kalina: Commander, the MPs have restored the defensive perimeter, and they're opening fire on the protestors!

Commander: So we're going to open a peace conference with a massacre... How ironic...

RO635: What should we do now, Commander?

Commander: Lock down the district roads that K indicated and exterminate any hidden threat units and vehicles.

Commander: All units be advised, the protestors are not our enemy, take care not to harm any civilians by accident.

...

RO635: Whew...trying to stop vehicle-borne enemies with small arms is just too difficult!

M4 SOPMOD II: It's not so bad, right? We did it, didn't we?

RO635: That's because you have a grenade launcher! If only the HOCs could have opened fire too...

M4 SOPMOD II: Hahaha, I think it's more fun when I do it myself! Do you want me to fit you with my grenade launcher?

RO635: Er...I think not.

RO635: Fortunately we only need to handle three roads, the Statesec agents are finally making themselves useful...

M4 SOPMOD II: I don't think three roads are enough! I've been pent up for too long, I'd rather have a bigger BOOOOM!

RO635: (Groans)I can't be bothered to nag you anymore...

RO635: ...

RO635: Huh? The sounds of the disturbance are dying down... Is it over already?

Kalina: RO, have you eliminated the enemies outside?

RO635: Let me check with the other teams... Hm, the other teams are confirming that the hidden threat signals have completely vanished.

Kalina: Thank you all for your hard work~

Kalina: According to the surveillance teams, the MPs have regained control of the main entrance to the conference hall and the protestors have been almost completely dispersed. Things should be returning to normal soon.

RO635: Phew...hopefully things will end with that.

M4 SOPMOD II: Aw...was that the last enemy...?

M4 SOPMOD II: But why...I didn't even get to enjoy myself...

...In the distance.

???: Heeheehee... Didn't get to enjoy yourself, you say?

???: Don't be in such a rush, my pretty, you haven't even set foot into the banquet yet~

???: Although, speaking of which, didn't I say before that such crude methods were useless?

???: Honestly, they didn't listen at all. They're stupid, and stupid. People deserve to die in a stupid way.

???: Heeheehee, the idiots outside are already dead, but how about the ones inside?

???: I look forward to it~

...

Chairwoman Ulrich: "Our old wounds show our past mistakes. We should not be grateful for the hardships we have experienced, but neither can we deny them."

...The reporters' shutters do not stop for a moment, and countless television cameras stream the press conference live from the summit.

Kalina: Let's see what's on TV...

Kalina: "...The representative of the Pan-European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Reconstruction, Chairwoman Gilda Ulrich and Ambassador Roshchin, Plenipotentiary of the Neo-Soviet Council of Mutual Assistance in Europe, have begun making their joint statement according to schedule. Chairwoman Ulrich once again stresses the importance of the United Nations in rebuilding Europe, and conveys the goodwill of the PECMAR to the Neo-Soviet Union's ambassador..."

Kalina: Speaking of which, that news program from earlier didn't mention Chairwoman Ulrich would be coming, did it?

Commander: It's quite normal to change candidates at the last minute to protect against sabotage or assassination.

Kalina: That's true...

Kalina: But I didn't expect the press to not mention the clash outside at all...

Kalina: It's as though nobody cared that such a big explosion happened, like the inside and outside were two different worlds...

Commander: Even if rivers of blood flowed, the people on top would only let the world see what they wanted to show them.

Commander: We should be thanking our lucky stars that this meeting is going to close out at this pace instead of worrying about unnecessary things.

Commander: ...

Commander: (The enemies outside have been dealt with...but is that really the end of the threats... What about the abnormalities inside the conference hall... Was I really overthinking things?)

Chairwoman Ulrich: "If there were no storms, we would not understand the value of calm days. Peace has never been something that could be easily obtained. If anyone overlooks that point, then peace will never come—"

Commander: ...Her speech is pretty much by the book...

X95: Commander.

Commander: Hm...?

X95: You need to hear this.

"Our comrades outside have been slaughtered, we can't continue the plan!"

"What the hell are you saying?! We can't let our comrades' sacrifice be in vain! We have to finish our mission, even if we're the only ones left!"

Commander: When was this recorded?

X95: 30 seconds ago. I set up a directional mic as you instructed, and I picked this up. It was very soft, and it came from the conference room, where you are. The lounge is sealed off and I can't enter, so I couldn't pinpoint the speakers' location.

Commander: Understood. Try to think of a way to get a more accurate fix. Also, have the infiltration team get ready for battle.

X95: Yes, Commander.

...

...Out of the corner of my eye, I suddenly notice that the Belgradian security troopers have silently and unobtrusively grown in number. The troopers outside the secure doors whisper to each other with their mouths covered, then they suddenly close the main door. Meanwhile, the security troopers beside the stage gather in an unnatural way.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Mr. Rossartre once warned us that every man's fate was not unconnected, that our common destiny was composed of countless individual destinies combined into one, but meaningless suspicion and resistance have turned us from unity to division and dissipation, and have also led to wars turning our homes into rubble.

Chairwoman Ulrich: In the past, people were sacrificed for their nations' survival. These pointless sacrifices must end now!

Chairwoman Ulrich: This sacrifice should be borne by more responsible people, and this meeting is to build a consensus among those great nations who are possessed of such responsibility. Only with true, sincere cooperation, by building trust, and by joining our hands once more can we avert the tragedy of further sacrifice! Thank you, everyone!

The audience erupts into thunderous applause. Chairwoman Ulrich bows humbly to them, then she nods to Ambassador Roshchin behind her before preparing to step off the stage.

Security Trooper: Madam Chairwoman, a moment please.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Is something the matter?

...Bang!

A gunshot echoes through the conference room.

The security trooper suddenly fired into the air, freezing everyone present in place.

Security Trooper: Yes, Madam Chairwoman, something very important is about to happen!

Security Trooper: Our wrath can no longer be contained, and today we will expose your lies to the public!

I look around. The main door to the conference hall is sealed tight and the ten-odd security troopers around us are pointing the jet-black muzzles of their guns at everyone present.

At me, at Kalina, at the other reporters, and...at the ambassador on the stage.
Part 7

    7chevron_right

...

X95: Commander, I can hear gunfire from inside the hall.

X95: We're in position outside the door and are ready to go at any time.

X95: Commander?

Commander: ......

If the infiltration team bursts in, even if they manage to take out several renegade soldiers, the remainder will open fire and probably kill the ambassador.

The odds of being able to completely neutralize the enemy without any casualties are practically non-existent...

Dammit, things are looking really bad! What the hell is K up to?

...

Inside the Belgrade Conference Hall meeting room.

Renegade Soldier: Madam Chairwoman, your speech was very moving, so much so it made me want to throw up!

Chairwoman Ulrich: ......

Renegade Soldier: What the hell was that about mutual aid and trust? You mentioned sacrifice just now, right? Just now, our brothers and sisters, our arms and legs were mercilessly slaughtered outside those doors! All they wanted was to air their grievances, but now they're all face down in pools of blood!

Chairwoman Ulrich: Who are you?!

Renegade Soldier: We are the executors who cleanse the filthy, the loyal and mighty servants of Paradeus, the executioners of you sinners whose mouths are stuffed full of lies! You claim to be for the people, yet you exclude them beyond your walls to fend for themselves! Since you say that the people must not be divided, then today we shall shatter the wall that represents this division!

Commander: I need to be patient... I need to find the chance to strike...

I quietly observe the surroundings. It would seem there are others doing the same thing.

The renegade soldier roughly shoves the Chairwoman to the front of the stage.

Renegade Soldier: You said it just now, didn't you? Sacrifices ought to be borne by those who are more responsible! Then why not be the first to die?!

Renegade Soldier: Your blood shall sanctify our revolution!

The renegade soldier points his rifle at the Chairwoman's head.

Chairwoman Ulrich: This is not my first time staring down the barrel of a gun. I've been prepared to die ever since I devoted myself to Rossartrism.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Even if you open fire now, what can you change? Conflict will only hurt more people. Then when will we be able to rebuild our homes?

Renegade Soldier: Those are your homes, not ours!

Chairwoman Ulrich: They're one and the same, why don't you understand that!

Renegade Soldier: You shut your whore mouth and go to hell!

Commander: This is bad—!

Commander: X95, commence—

K: Unable to take it already, Commander?

Commander: What?!

...

...Bang! Bang! Bang!

Renegade Soldier: ...

Renegade Soldier: You...

...A neat little circle appears between the renegade soldier's eyebrows, and fresh blood trickles out of it.

Behind him, Ambassador Roshchin is gripping a pistol tight in his hand.

The faces of the other renegade soldiers are covered in shock, and the reporters whom they are supposed to be watching suddenly whip out guns of their own.

Commander: ...I see.

Commander: Kalina, get down!

...A second later, gunfire fills the meeting room.

X95: Commander, Kalina, are you exchanging fire with the enemy?!

Kalina: It's not us! Not us!

...

Commander: ...Looks like it's over.

...The renegade soldiers in the meeting room were gunned down almost instantaneously by the armed reporters.

Many people begin to rise from the press seating to inspect the guards' bodies. All of them are holding weapons.

Undercover Agent A: The room is clear. Verify that all hostiles have been eliminated.

Undercover Agent B: Yes, sir. Team Three, with me.

Commander: Tsk... Goddammit...

Commander: Was this all part of your script, K?

K: I told you, you're just a backup force.

Commander: I'm guessing that none of the people sitting here are real reporters?

K: Real reporters wouldn't be able to handle a scene like this.

I look to the stage, where the Ambassador is consoling Chairwoman Ulrich.

Ambassador Roshchin: My sincere apologies, Madam Chairwoman. It seems we gave you quite a fright.

Chairwoman Ulrich: No, no...it's alright... As long as nobody was hurt...

Commander: Everything that happened just now was caught on camera. The headlines tomorrow will read "Terrorists attempt to disrupt peace talks, but both nations combine forces to crush the conspiracy and ensure the progress of peace."

Commander: It'll make for spectacular publicity, and with such stunning news in play, it won't even matter that the summit didn't start properly.

K: I suddenly feel that being a commander might not be your true calling. You would make quite a fine reporter for a small tabloid, too.

Commander: Humph... So that's why you brushed off my objections just now. You already knew that the real enemy was lurking within the venue itself, didn't you?

K: The Belgrade authorities have already uncovered the rebels and handed their names over to us. Their remaining confederates have also been liquidated by our agents. It's funny, really. They sealed off the corridors within the conference hall, but in the end it left them unable to escape. What idiots.

Commander: And we were nothing more than the supporting players for the supporting players.

Commander: Never mind, I won't go into it. Though those rebels mentioned a name just now, Paradeus... It kind of bothers me.

K: I've already looked into it. That name's come up before, in reports from the Yellow Zones. It's the name of an organization which has all the characteristics of a cult. So if I'm not wrong, Paradeus should be the true name of the White Faction.

Commander: Paradeus... Do these guys really think God will save them? Forget it, in any case, we can finally stop using a silly name like "White Faction".

K: What difference does it make to a bunch of corpses?

...

???: Oh yes, what's the point if they're all dead? I can't believe there are people who still don't understand something that even imbeciles know...

???: Heeheeheehee...looks like the people inside were every bit the hopeless nincompoops as the ones outside.

???: Ahhh, but of course I knew they were morons, given how they proudly declared themselves to be servants of Paradeus.

???: Father would never pick such fools to be his servants. I'm the only one Father needs.

???: Heeheeheehee...

???: Still, that's fine too. At least I won't need to waste time on finding the rats in hiding. Now then, the warmup's complete. Is everyone ready?

...

Commander: I believe our mission should be complete, then. When do we get to meet Ange?

K: I'm a man of my word. Call back your Dolls, I'll begin arrang—

Suddenly, a massive tremor rises underneath my feet.

Kalina: Is...is that an earthquake?

K: What...what did you say?!

K suddenly cuts the transmission.

...Click.

Lewis: Commander! There was a huge explosion in the distance, can you see it from your end?!

Lewis: Things look really bad!

Kalina: A huge explosion?

RO635: Commander, our forces are under enemy attack! It's the White Faction! They're in a completely different league from the previous enemies! SOP-II, get down!

Kalina: What's going on?!

RO635: It's an ambush! We've lost half our Dolls! We can't hold this point any longer, please give us permission to withdraw to the conference hall!

Commander: Granted! But you need to stay outside the hall, otherwise the MPs might open fire on you!

RO635: Understood, we'll maintain a safe distance!

Kalina: Didn't Mr. K say the mission was already over? How could this...

Commander: Clearly, "Paradeus" doesn't share that opinion.

Commander: As I thought... It was a Nyto I saw just now... I'm sure I wasn't mistaken.

Commander: Tsk, at the very least the conference hall is a sturdy location, and we have the Statesec agents and the MPs' firepower on our side...

Commander: Goddammit, K! Answer me! Don't start playing dead again at a time like this!

K: Special circumstances, Commander. The mission is still in progress. Ensure the VIP's safety.

Commander: My Dolls outside have taken a real beating, I need to pull them back here to mount a defense!

K: Tsk...you were ambushed too? I've lost contact with over two thirds of the field agent teams all of a sudden.

Commander: Maybe the real enemy found their locations while they were pinpointing the small fry from earlier. We've taken heavy losses ourselves. We need you to change our Dolls' IFF codes immediately!

K: I'll designate your Dolls as friendlies, but the VIP must be unharmed.

...The Statesec agents in the hall have apparently gotten the message too, because they promptly spring into action.

The agents begin fortifying the meeting lounge, their top priority being to ensure the safety of the ambassador and the Chairwoman.

KSVK: Commander, we have sightings of ELIDs on the streets.

KSVK: They're hot on the heels of the fleeing populace and do not seem to be moving toward any particular destination.

KSVK: Your directions, please.

Kalina: ELIDs? You mean the monsters we encountered before in the contaminated zone? What are they doing in the city?

KSVK: Given that the sound of the explosion came from the direction of the purification towers, it's very likely that the city walls have been breached. The assault team has retreated and our surveillance post is now isolated. Shall we continue monitoring the situation?

Commander: Abandon your post and fall back towards the conference hall, then link up with RO.

Commander: Since the Infected aren't rushing straight towards this place, it means we still have some time.

Commander: The conference hall was the strongpoint of the MP's defense to begin with. They've got more people here, so the enemy shouldn't be able to...

...Blam blam.

Commander: What?

...Blam blam.

Huge bullet holes suddenly appear in the reinforced concrete walls, piercing into the meeting room after penetrating several walls.

Commander: 30mm AP shells...!

Agent: Everyone get down!

Ambassador Roshchin: Ensure the Chairwoman's safety! Please follow me, Ma'am!

Chairwoman Ulrich: Alright — Whoaaaa!

An AP round hits Ambassador Roshchin square in the center of his torso and tears him in half.

His corpse falls on Chairwoman Ulrich and knocks her out.

...The Statesec agents inside the lounge are taken out by sniper fire from the outside. The defending agents fall to one precise shot after another.

Commander: Kalina, stay close to me!

Commander: K, the Statesec agents are all down!

K: I know.

...Blam!

Another agent is instantly killed by a large-caliber round that blasts clean through the piece of cover he was hiding behind.

Commander: They're using armor-piercing rounds on soft targets... This is horrific!

K: There are still traitors inside the conference hall.

K: It's not just the agents who exposed themselves earlier who were eliminated, but also the squads still on standby.

K: There must be a spotter inside directing the enemy's fire.

Commander: There's too many people in here now!

Commander: Give me that magical namelist of yours so I can tell who's a traitor!

K: ...I can't.

K: The conference hall isn't safe anymore. Find some way to interdict their line of fire and get the VIP out of this sector.

Commander: Did Statesec expect something like this too?

K: Tsk... Things shouldn't have gone this way.

...The transmission ends.

Commander: X95! Have your team clear a path to the basement. Lewis! Get down from your observation point. We'll deploy smoke grenades so you can come to the conference room and get the VIP to the basement! After linking up, you'll combine your teams and serve as the VIP protection squad. Got that?!

X95: Understood!

KSVK: Received.

Commander: All forces take note, the VIP Team is preparing to leave the conference hall.

Commander: RO, SOP-II, are you alright?

RO635: We're treating the injuries of the Dolls who were attacked!

RO635: The enemy snipers are prioritizing human targets, the MPs and police outside are being routed!

RO635: What should we do next?

Commander: We're preparing to head to the basement, and we need to ensure a clear axis of retreat before making our next move. We'll get the VIP out the back door, but I need you to go there and clear the path outside. Once the VIP gets out, you'll take over protection duties.

RO635: ...Understood!

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, the streets are starting to fill with fleeing people.

M4 SOPMOD II: Those things coming at us... Are they really ELIDs?

Commander: I don't know, but prepare yourself.

Commander: Kill everything in your way, whether they're Infected or Paradeus.

K: Still alive, Commander?

Commander: Just barely.

K: I've lost contact with most of the agent teams lying in wait outside. The remaining teams are searching for the enemy artillery positions. The interior of the conference hall is in shambles too. Nobody's responding from the command center and Ambassador Roshchin has been confirmed KIA.

Commander: What a freaking mess...

Commander: Please tell me you still have a backup plan.

K: There's a cathedral several streets down, a reserve evac point. It's quite sturdy, which should help you in defending it.

Commander: Alright, I'll think of a way to get the VIP there.

Commander: Any clue as to the enemy's movements?

K: Paradeus has infiltrated the Belgrade authorities

K: My guess is that while we were clearing the ambush outside, the renegades within the Belgrade authorities grasped the details of the Statesec agent deployment and some mole leaked the details of our plan. The antics before were just a feint to get us to lower our guard.

Commander: I can't believe you can say all that so calmly.

K: I'm forcing it out through gritted teeth here.

K: Everything that happened previously went in our favor, but it was only to make us think that the situation was still under control.

K: They let the first wave be wiped out easily so we would think the second wave was their main force.

K: But the fact is that everyone before this was nothing but cannon fodder, and the enemies with real strength are actually in this third wave of attack, and they were planning to unleash the most extreme devastation from the beginning...

Commander: What on earth is their objective?

Commander: If they've gone this far, it can't just be to disrupt the talks, right?!

K: They do have an objective, but I didn't expect them to be willing to sacrifice an entire city for it...

Commander: And you can't talk about this objective, right? I'm guessing their aim has something to do with what Ange is doing.

K: I won't deny that, given the circumstances. She's probably in danger too; I've lost contact with her as well.

K: We need to establish a safe zone so she'll at least have somewhere to fall back to if she moves deeper into the city.

Commander: I'll do my best. We'll need the HOCs going forward, so I need permission to deploy them.

K: Permission granted. I'll be counting on you, Commander.

...

After nightfall in the city, in a certain darkened alleyway

AR-15 sits quietly in a blind spot of the surveillance cameras. The light from the city outside filters into the alley and reaches her eyes.

Even when she hears footsteps, she does not look back. Instead—

AN-94: If you point your gun at me, I might return fire by reflex.

ST AR-15: In that case, don't just pop up from behind me.

AR-15 puts her gun away, but just as she is about to stand up, AN-94 falls to one knee before her.

This is not a gesture of loyalty, simply a way of facilitating what will happen next. AR-15 knows that very well, so she directs her eyes to the heavy backpack she has just taken off.

AN-94: I've brought your gear and batteries. There may be a very long fight ahead of us and Ange doesn't want us to waste precious time on running back and forth to resupply.

ST AR-15: How did you get here?

AN-94: Through the sewers. AK-12 found a map of the city's sewers during the last operation, so she handed it to me. There are some places that are quite handy to set up camp in secret.

AN-94: However, the map's not too complete, and there are some suspicious sources of jamming which you should avoid. After filtering them out, we only have a couple of routes that we can take.

ST AR-15: It'd be weird if there weren't any sources of jamming with that white bunch around.

ST AR-15: Let's see what you brought...

ST AR-15: Ammo...and lots of it, enough for two people. A signal filtering kit, a biothermal analyzer...and what's this crowbar doing here?

AN-94: AK-12 told me to bring it, she said it might come in useful. Also, this is your radio, it's been encrypted.

ST AR-15: Thank you...and what is this?

AR-15 holds up a book that was lying at the bottom of the tactical bag.

AN-94: It's the Holy Bible.

ST AR-15: And did AK-12 ask you to bring that as well?

AN-94: Da. She said it could be useful before your operation.

ST AR-15: As if that could be...

ST AR-15: ...I see, there was a slottable chip with preloaded apps on it.

AN-94: Since you're unable to connect to the Zener Network, the chip should be able to help you update your essential functions.

ST AR-15: ...Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

AN-94: AK-12 prepared it. If you want to thank anyone, then thank her.

ST AR-15: You keep going on about AK-12, how deeply in love with her are you anyway?

AN-94: It's not love...

AN-94: Ever since I was rolled out, I was designed to accompany and protect her. It is my purpose in life, the guidepost for the actions I take, my fate and my destiny. I believe that should be an accurate description.

ST AR-15: You're almost making me sick.

AN-94: From your combat records, you weren't much different from me in terms of what you did for M4.

ST AR-15: That was because of that damn core order...

ST AR-15: But M4 means nothing to me now.

ST AR-15: You, on the other hand, sound like how the believers describe their God in that Bible.

ST AR-15: It's pathological.

AN-94: Have you read the Bible before?

ST AR-15: My database contains some elementary knowledge on it, along with information about human religions and lifestyle.

ST AR-15: ...Humans worship their God, and in return they hope God will save them.

AN-94: Then...do you believe in God?

ST AR-15: Why would a Doll need to believe in God? Don't tell me your neural cloud's so fragile that you need God to comfort you and fill the hole in your life?

AN-94: I was simply mentioning a possibility, but each and every time you refuse to give me a proper answer.

ST AR-15: Humph...

ST AR-15: If I really believed in a god, then my god would be Persica.

ST AR-15: Do you honestly think I would feel anything like reverence for a "god" who gave me such a miserable fate?

AN-94: To Dolls, everything has already been planned out. Our gods are our creators and our creators' orders are absolute, just like how humans can't question their gods.

ST AR-15: What a boring answer.

AN-94: However, unlike how humans are shackled by destiny, we are unbound, except by the orders of our gods.

AN-94: That is why we are called "DEFY".

AN-94: We cannot escape the choices of our gods, but I can make choices of my own outside that.

AN-94: And my choice is that no matter what AK-12 expects of me, I will do as she wishes.

ST AR-15: ...Even if it means you will struggle without hope for the sweet release of death?

AN-94: Unlike you, we don't have the concept of death.

AN-94: The purpose for our existence is to complete our tasks and support a certain someone.

ST AR-15: ...I've had it.

ST AR-15: Pretend I never brought this up.

AN-94: Have I upset you?

ST AR-15: No.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: It seems I've upset you.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I don't really understand why Ange arranged for us to be in the same team.

ST AR-15: Looks like we won't be great conversational partners. In that case, let's focus our attention on how to carry out our upcoming mission.

AN-94: Yes, the mission is the highest priority.

AN-94: Your energy accumulators should be fully charged now, so we can begin the operation after your body calibrator gives you the green light.

ST AR-15: Roger.

ST AR-15: I'll handle the outskirts, you take care of the city districts. We'll split up and move separately.

ST AR-15: "If you spot those white bastards, don't carelessly exchange fire."

AN-94: "Verify their location; the top priority is to see if they're linked to the 'Node'."

ST AR-15: Orders verified. 5 seconds remaining. 3, 2, 1, — move out!

...

AN-94 slowly forges ahead through the city streets, in the bustling heart of the commercial district.

Hailing AR-15, please respond.

ST AR-15: Received. I'm entering a region with high signal density as planned. How are things on your end?

AN-94: Carrying out passive scanning as planned.

AN-94: Other than your region, there are 43 new locations with suspicious signals, and 18 of them are confirmed to be using White Faction wavelengths. I can't accurately pinpoint the others. Do I need to increase scanner power?

ST AR-15: No need. Ange said that someone else will handle the small fries. We mustn't run the risk of exposure.

ST AR-15: Focus on finding the clues to the "Node". We need to filter through to the high-value targets ASAP.

AN-94: Understood. I'm currently eavesdropping on all the verified units. No extra news for the time being.

AN-94: Although...the strange thing is that I've discovered signal wavelengths similar to S.F.'s.

ST AR-15: S.F.?

ST AR-15: What's S.F. doing here?!

AN-94: Similar to S.F. It only appeared for a moment and I thought I had been mistaken...but they were very similar, to the point where one could conclude that there were S.F. Dolls in the city.

ST AR-15: ...Why would S.F. come to Belgrade...

ST AR-15: In that case, will she come here too...

AN-94: AR-15...our main objective is not those S.F. Dolls.

AN-94: We should make completing our mission our top priority.

ST AR-15: But...

ST AR-15: ...You're right, we don't have much time.

ST AR-15: Make a note of the signal source, we can talk about the rest after the mission is complete.

AN-94: Alright, I've marked the location.

ST AR-15: Let's not worry about that for now.

ST AR-15: Now then...

ST AR-15: ...I've reached the target sector.

ST AR-15: This is...a military camp?

...

The soldier on sentry duty looks around, and just as he turns back, a shadow silently leaps over the wall surrounding the camp.

ST AR-15: AN-94, can you hear me?

AN-94: Received. How are things?

ST AR-15: I'm already inside the military base. As I expected, the signal markers here are very obvious... A very amateurish way of hiding a signal. I was even a little worried that this was a trap.

AN-94: So are you going to leave?

ST AR-15: It's not the first time I've known it was a trap and walked into it anyway. More importantly, I can't just come away from this empty-handed.

ST AR-15: Help me set up a secure channel, I need to contact Ange.

AN-94: Must you use the radio? No matter how much you encrypt them, old signal patterns like that are easily intercepted. It's not like we can't unlock your Zener Protocol...

ST AR-15: I don't want to hear that voice again. Could you cut the chit-chat?

AN-94: As you wish.

AN-94: Secure channel established. I'll maintain it for 60 seconds.

AN-94: Hailing Ange, please come in.

Angelia: Received. How's progress?

ST AR-15: This is AR-15.

ST AR-15: I'm investigating the first cluster of white signals. This is a garrison camp, but not a large one.

ST AR-15: It's very likely that the military district is linked to the "Node", so I'll be sneaking in to scout the place.

ST AR-15: I can verify the position of the signal here for the most part. Will any demolition be required?

Angelia: Don't be hasty.

Angelia: Others will handle the task of eliminating the infiltrators. All you need to do is send all the positional data you've collected to me.

Angelia: Conduct a full reconnaissance on the entire camp. My instincts tell me there's a big fish there.

ST AR-15: I don't get it.

ST AR-15: How important is the "Node"?

ST AR-15: Is it really alright to leave the enemies hiding here alone, even if they might end up hurting or killing the humans in this city?

Angelia: The mission I gave you was to find clues related to the "Node", not protect civilians.

Angelia: You're not a PMC employee anymore, AR-15.

ST AR-15: ...Understood.

ST AR-15: AN-94's also found some white signal clusters apart from this camp. There are even S.F. signals in the city.

Angelia: Is that so...

Angelia: 94, what's the exact number of signals you've screened?

AN-94: 52, and nine more signal sources appeared in the past 30 minutes.

Angelia: It makes no sense that so much trash could burrow in here and not be detected.

Angelia: Even if their "Baptized" are here, hiding so many entities at once is very difficult.

ST AR-15: According to my investigations, they're not bothering to hide themselves at all.

Angelia: That would mean...there's a problem with the immune system.

Angelia: So having white signals in a garrison is a perfectly reasonable answer.

ST AR-15: However powerful the White Faction might be, I doubt it extends to making the local army do their bidding...

ST AR-15: From what I know, this country has maintained absolute neutrality.

Angelia: I don't think it's possible that the army would obey the White Faction's commands either.

Angelia: Maintaining one's neutrality in a dangerous situation requires stringently-selected troops and great political skill.

Angelia: But leaves only fall after the roots have rotted.

ST AR-15: So they've been compromised from the inside, then...

ST AR-15: I understand.

AN-94: The secure channel is going to expire soon.

Angelia: Continue monitoring the situation until new information comes up. I look forward to hearing good news from you.

ST AR-15: Ange cut off the transmission.

ST AR-15: (Sighs) What a troublesome mission. AN-94, I'll remain hidden in this camp to observe the situation. I need you to keep an eye on the camp's other exit.

AN-94: Meow...

ST AR-15: Meow?

AN-94: Oh, it's nothing. I see the coordinates you sent. I'll be there in half an hour. AN-94 out.

AN-94 shuts off her comms.

A soft sensation rises up from her leg and one of the stray cats wandering through the park attempts to jump onto AN-94's thigh.

AN-94 bends down to lift the cat up onto her lap and gently caresses its soft fur.

???: An adorable creature, is it not?

AN-94: ??

???: Who would realize that cats are actually terrifying predators when they're being all cute and cuddly?

AN-94: You are?

???: Sorry, my apologies. I'm a local resident and I often come by to feed the cats, so please don't mind me.

The girl scatters some cat food on the ground, and the cat that was seated on AN-94's lap immediately jumps down.

???: Then, it's about time to take my leave as well.

AN-94 stands and prepares to leave.

As she passes the girl, the girl muses aloud...

???: Are you also like that? A cute and cuddly predator?

AN-94: !!

AN-94 looks back in shock, but the girl is already gone.

And there is no trace of the cat food or the kitty on the ground.
Part 2

Three hours flew by, and the sun has sank completely beneath the horizon.

Outside the military camp, below a certain unassuming manhole cover.

AN-94: AR-15, I'm at the designated location.

ST AR-15: Why did you take so long...

AN-94: I might have... Nyet, it's nothing. I took a detour because I didn't want to be followed.

ST AR-15: Hm?

ST AR-15: Well, whatever. All that matters is that you came.

ST AR-15: ...I've been keeping watch for three hours now, and neither the signal source inside the base nor the military forces here have made any abnormal moves.

AN-94: This might just be a backup unit. If only we could hack the systems here and conduct electronic surveillance...

AN-94: I'm sorry, if AK-12 was here instead, she'd probably be able to do a better job.

ST AR-15: Don't say that sort of thing.

ST AR-15: ...I'll sneak in again once it's dark. Help me keep an eye on the movement of personnel in and out of the base.

AN-94: Understood.

AN-94: Wait...!

ST AR-15: Hm? What's wrong?

AN-94: Something doesn't feel right...

ST AR-15: Something doesn't feel right? Let me do a scan... A vehicle has started up, it's a jeep. But it's not emitting any signals with White Faction characteristics.

AN-94: Nyet... that can't be it. There's something wrong with that vehicle, we have to catch up to it right now!

ST AR-15: W-Wait... Aren't you going to discuss this with Ange first?!

ST AR-15: 94! AN-94! I can't believe she just ran out on her own like that!

AR-15 has no choice but to abandon her hiding place to chase after AN-94.

ST AR-15: Dammit!

ST AR-15: Ange, do you read me?

Angelia: I read you. What's the matter, why are you broadcasting in clear?

ST AR-15: AN-94 ran off by herself to chase a military vehicle, I can't establish a secure channel by myself!

ST AR-15: Something's wrong with her, I'm doing my best to catch up with her in case something happens!

Angelia: So we've sighted the big one at last.

ST AR-15: The big one?

Angelia: 94's instincts have always been very accurate. There must be some important clue on that vehicle.

Angelia: If she's chasing it in such a hurry, then it's very likely that the vehicle's headed straight to the base where the "Node" is being kept.

ST AR-15: That doesn't mean she had to run off on her own... I'll catch up and follow the vehicle with her.

ST AR-15: If we do find the "Node", should we destroy it immediately?

ST AR-15: What on earth could it be...?

Angelia: You don't need to know. The moment you find something like it, wait for my order and destroy it on the spot.

ST AR-15: ...Understood.

ST AR-15: This channel isn't secure. I'll find some way to contact you after I catch up with AN-94.

Angelia: Acknowledged.

Angelia: I'll be waiting for the two of you to contact me again, AR-15.
Part 3

The jeep comes to a halt outside a set of ruins.

AN-94: The target has ceased their advance.

AN-94: Someone's getting down from the vehicle... they have black hair... and black clothes.

AN-94: ...That's her... That's the girl who was feeding the cat.

AN-94: Is she a Nyto... is she one of the White Faction's Baptized...

AN-94: But why doesn't she transmit any of the characteristic signals? It's as though... she's a normal human being...

The girl looks in AN-94's direction, and AN-94 scrambles frantically behind a rock.

AN-94: Did she see me? But that's impossible... I'm a full three kilometers away from her...

There is a noise behind AN-94, and she hurriedly turns and raises her gun.

AN-94: I remember you warned me not to approach from behind your back.

ST AR-15: ...And who was the one who suddenly ran out on her own?

ST AR-15: How are things?

AN-94: The target's in front of the ruins three kilometers ahead.

ST AR-15: Three kilometers... Let me see... There are no suspicious signals coming from over there, no?

AN-94: But I know there's a Nyto over there.

AN-94: Before I regrouped with you at the military camp, she launched an electronic attack on my Level II.

AN-94: So I remember how she feels.

ST AR-15: You were hacked?!

ST AR-15: Why didn't you say anything just now?

AN-94: I didn't know if I should bring it up or not...

AN-94: I spent a long time checking myself over and over again, but she didn't leave any backdoors in my neural cloud.

AN-94: It was a provocation... She felt she didn't need to resort to that sort of thing with me...

ST AR-15: But your neural cloud defenses are military-grade, right...?

ST AR-15: How on earth did she do it...?

AN-94: That's not important. What matters is that afterwards, I'll make her regret not doing so while she had the chance.

ST AR-15: It's rare to see you angry.

AN-94: ...

ST AR-15: Want to move closer?

AN-94: I'm not sure about the range of her hacking attacks, so it's best not to approach rashly.

ST AR-15: Makes sense, we need to be cautious.

ST AR-15: Can you hear their conversation?

AN-94: I'm bringing a directional microphone over.

AN-94: ...I'll share what I find with you.

ST AR-15: While you can't really tell from her expression... AN-94 is most definitely furious. She may actually be quite different from what I imagined.

Officer: We're here, this is the place.

???: Ah, is this the humans' safe house?

???: It feels like it has several hundred years of history behind it.

Officer: Yes, this place predates the foundation of our government by a long shot.

Officer: There's no safer place than this when it comes to defenses, and no other place has more ritual significance than here.

???: No wonder fairy tales always happen in places like this.

???: "I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved, somehow - the central heart that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams, and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities."

Officer: I didn't know you were one for poetry.

???: Don't you think it's appropriate?

Officer: Unfortunately, my job isn't poetic in the slightest. This way please, Miss Mercurows.

The jeep door closes, and the girl enters the fortress interior at the officer's urging.

ST AR-15: Mercurows... what kind of weird name is that?

ST AR-15: Do Nytos not call themselves Nyto now?

AN-94: She's not quite like the Nytos I've seen before...

AN-94: It might be best not to rely too much on past experiences with other Nytos when dealing with her.

ST AR-15: Tsk...

ST AR-15: The walls are too thick, I can't hear their voices.

AN-94: It's a stone wall. Cuts down heavily on audio penetration.

AN-94: This place was once called Belgrade Fortress. It was preserved in 1979 as a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance by the nation.

AN-94: In the 3rd century BC it served the Celts as a defensive fortification, and its main structure was erected in the 17th century. It is a symbol of glory and stability to the people of this nation.

ST AR-15: I didn't know you were so well-versed in history.

AN-94: AK-12 is a very curious one, so I prepared ample material to answer all kinds of questions.

AN-94: While I'm partnered with you this time, having more backup plans means having more solutions to choose from.

AN-94: In addition to the above, I downloaded the anthropological information for the region.

ST AR-15: Aren't we well-prepared.

ST AR-15: There's no point lingering here. Since they've already entered the fortress, let's get a little closer and take a look.

Several minutes later, AR-15 and AN-94 quietly sneak into the fortress.

ST AR-15: This Nyto... no, Mercurows seems a little different from the ones we encountered before...

ST AR-15: I can't believe she went out of her way to make contact with you. Isn't that being too showy?

AN-94: I don't have too much experience with personalities.

AN-94: From my observations of her up to this point, she's definitely more frank and open than AK-12, but at the same time, she's also harder to predict.

ST AR-15: Don't keep using AK-12 as a yardstick for everything.

ST AR-15: Don't you have any other standards you can use for making decisions?

AN-94: There's Ange. But Ange's human, so you can't really use her as a basis for comparison...

ST AR-15: Ugh... that's enough... we'll end that topic here.

ST AR-15: I didn't think there'd be so many passages under this old fortress... Which path leads where, anyway...

AN-94: The hidden underground tunnels were dug to facilitate the secret deployment of troops by royalty or to assist in their own escape. The paths here are very complex; take care that you don't get lost.

ST AR-15: Hidden tunnels, huh... Sounds like it would be very suitable for something leading to an object that needs to be hidden. That works for me.

ST AR-15: Ange was right about you; your instincts are indeed very keen.

ST AR-15: Can you determine Mercurows' position?

AN-94: She's not emitting any signals. I'll try to pinpoint her location through sound.

ST AR-15: She has her mooks who shouldn't be broadcasting signals march proudly through the city, but a Baptized who ought to be emitting signals doesn't even return an echo...

ST AR-15: How is she going to lead her people if she doesn't link up with them?

AN-94: I don't quite get it myself... Shh, they've started talking again.

AN-94 continues listening to the conversation taking place far within the depths of the tunnels.

Mercurows: How surprising.

Mercurows: I thought we'd need to discuss things for longer before reaching an accord. I didn't expect us to understand each other so quickly.

Officer: My followers and I are of one mind, and we're prepared to cooperate with the outside world.

Mercurows: Because the present situation isn't looking too good for you?

Mercurows: Like someone who stares overlong at the crescent moon and mislikes the light from other sources?

Officer: Like I told you before, we're not a poetic bunch. But I understand your meaning.

Officer: You're right. We don't want wicked thinking to enter our cities and pollute our people.

Mercurows: New light brings new ways of looking at things. What's so bad about that?

Mercurows: We bring a new light of our own, don't we, Mr. Officer?

Officer: It's not the same.

Officer: That so-called Rossartrism is a complete and utter farce.

Officer: While our fellow men were sleeping in the open wilds, eating nothing but the wind, those people could only think of how to build higher walls!

Officer: We will never forget, we will never forgive, and we will most definitely never compromise.

Officer: Those days of being deceived by a false peace are over. Even if the ones being deceived are our brothers, we hold the obligation to wake them up with our own hands, no matter whether we have to pay a price in blood!

Mercurows: Hm, their blood.

Mercurows: Well said. I applaud your determination.

Mercurows: Let us wake them all up then, with the blistering fires of war!

After filtering out the sound of footsteps, AR-15 carefully analyzes the audio signal she is receiving.

...Shortly afterwards.

Mercurows: I'm not imagining things, am I? It seems the surface on which we've been walking has been sloping downwards since not too long ago, Mr. Officer.

Mercurows: Our objective...the "Pike Node" should be located within the permanently-sealed nuclear bunker below, is it not?

Officer: In keeping with the anti-Relic treaties of the time, all such facilities were sealed away forever.

Mercurows: Hmm, I see.

Mercurows: A once-buried secret sits alone beneath the earth, awaiting a hero to venture forth and excavate it. It does seem a little romantic when you think of it that way.

Officer: There's no safer defensive measure than keeping it underground.

Officer: With just a little work, the land itself can become the sturdiest bulwark of mankind.

Mercurows: Well said. It is both protector and home to everything.

Mercurows: That really is quite poetic when you think about it... You said your job didn't lend itself to poetry, but now it seems that isn't the case at all.

Officer: Ahem, pardon me then. I ended up being influenced by you without realizing it.

Officer: Come, walk this way, please.

Officer: Below this is our...

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: It cut off.

AN-94: Why? They shouldn't have reached the maximum distance yet.

AN-94: ...I can't hear anything either.

AN-94: Did they enter a jamming zone?

AN-94: Or perhaps they've already discovered us...

AN-94: But if they've found out we were eavesdropping on them, then we ought to be surrounded by now.

ST AR-15: I haven't detected signals from any units, and I haven't heard anything out of place.

ST AR-15: ...Since it's not an encirclement, let's head a little further inside.

Now that their eavesdropping has been suddenly cut off, AR-15 and AN-94 have no choice but to continue forward.

ST AR-15: Just a little further ahead... a little more and I'll be able to see it clearly...

...

ST AR-15: So there was a barrier door up ahead. They went through it.

AN-94: This fortress has been through hundreds of battles and the fact that it's still standing is all thanks to its refurbishments over the generations. It makes perfect sense that they'd have installed state-of-the-art soundproofed doors like this. Given the markings, it seems it's a new model of safety door, manufactured less than 2 years ago.

AN-94: We must have filtered out the sound it made while opening as background noise.

ST AR-15: I think so too.

ST AR-15: There don't seem to be any other sentries, so let's catch up with them.

AN-94: Da.

They quietly open the barrier door, but soon they are faced with a fork in the road. They exchange a look.

ST AR-15: ...

AN-94: ...

AN-94: Let's not split up.

ST AR-15: The light here is pretty dim, and I don't see any cameras... Looks like they kept this place the way it was since the old days.

ST AR-15: Can you analyze the surroundings and tell which way they went?

AN-94: This place is too tightly sealed... The sensors and directional mics aren't picking up anything...

AN-94: ...

ST AR-15: Is that so...? Then you pick a path.

AN-94: In that case, let's go left.

ST AR-15: I hope your instincts are on the mark.

ST AR-15: We'll maintain bounding overwatch and advance cautiously.

AN-94: Understood.

10 minutes later, the two Dolls once again stand in a place that seems identical to where they were just now.

ST AR-15: Did we double back?

ST AR-15: This place is just like a maze!

AN-94: The passages here are built at special angles to confuse one's sense of direction. The people of the past probably designed it this way to prevent the enemy from launching a surprise attack through the hidden tunnels.

ST AR-15: Tsk... Couldn't they have applied their efforts somewhere else...?

ST AR-15: Let's try the path on the right. I've already recorded our route just now into my neural cloud. We won't retrace our footsteps.

ST AR-15: We have to find that Mercurows and...

AN-94: AR-15, I think we've gone too deep. Even if we find and destroy our objective, just securing a route of retreat will be extremely difficult for us, especially since there'll definitely be pursuers by then. I think our best course of action is to reach a place where we can send and receive transmissions, contact Ange, and receive orders as to our next step.

ST AR-15: Since we know the "Node" is below us, how can we go back empty-handed?

ST AR-15: Leaving aside what that Mercurows came here for, we might not get the chance to enter the inside of the fortress again, even if we do nothing.

ST AR-15: ...Or do you have another way?

AN-94: I don't intend to argue with you, AR-15.

AN-94: But...

...A dull sound interrupts their dispute. Surprised, both Dolls unconsciously look behind themselves.

ST AR-15: ...Was that...

ST AR-15: The barrier door?

AN-94: The barrier door... is locked.

ST AR-15: Then do you have a way to open the door?

AN-94: AK-12 might.

ST AR-15: In other words, you can't do it.

AN-94: Can you?

ST AR-15: I can't either...

AR-15 rounds her shoulders and sighs deeply. AN-94 watches her in silence.

AN-94: So what should we do after this, AR-15?

AN-94: You should have enough explosives on you to blast the door open.

ST AR-15: ...I was saving that to blow up the "Node". Forget it... let's keep heading down...

ST AR-15: That's... the only path for us now.
Part 4

4

Within the underground passage, the only sounds that could be heard was that of light footsteps and fabric rubbing against itself.

AN-94: Can you keep up, AR-15?

AN-94: I can sense your pace slowing down. Is something the matter?

ST AR-15: No, it's just that this place is getting darker and darker... I'm adjusting my night vision optics' parameters...

AN-94: Understood. I'll slow down and wait for you.

AN-94: Still, AR-15... have you noticed?

AN-94: The passage here is different from the outside.

ST AR-15: Is it a matter of the construction materials?

ST AR-15: It just feels a little different to the touch.

AN-94: This sector ought to be nothing but ancient architecture. It shouldn't be renovated, unlike the outside.

AN-94: It's very likely that this deeper portion might have been preserved as a relic, and I found a lot of hidden doors that are only big enough to admit one person...

AN-94: I've already recorded the positions of those hidden doors we passed. We might be able to use them in our retreat.

ST AR-15: I've been making a note of them myself. According to the parts of the map that we've already explored, it's very likely that these hidden doors are all interlinked, forming a network of secret passages.

ST AR-15: When you think about it, this place isn't just a maze, it's practically an anthill... Are you sure those passages won't collapse on us?

AN-94: They won't. They may be old, but their construction is solid. They were built using techniques we hardly see nowadays.

AN-94: I can't see any reason why they would collapse, barring an earthquake or a large explosion from below.

ST AR-15: ...Alright then, let's hope so.

ST AR-15: Hopefully things won't get so bad that we'll have to duck into these filthy hidden passages.
Part 5

    5chevron_right

In the end, after walking down countless forks in the road, the two Dolls finally see a bright light that's different from the illumination in the tunnels.

AN-94: I'm picking up sound... It's the two from just now.

AN-94: AR-15, we've caught up with them!

ST AR-15: Roger, then let's get closer... Be careful, there's a light up ahead shining toward us.

After passing through a narrow stone door, the area before them becomes much more spacious. The two of them immediately dart into the shadows and carefully observe their surroundings.

Compared to the ancient tunnels from before, this location is clearly a modern military facility.

ST AR-15: ...Is this a supply depot? I have to hand it to the people here, building a base under a heritage site.

AN-94: Old ruins usually end up spared no matter how brutal the fighting gets, so a base like this would be perfect for storing something away so others don't see it.

ST AR-15: A permanent nuclear bunker, huh... The "Node" sure is getting the luxury treatment.

AN-94: Shh... they're talking again.

Mercurows: Are we here at last? We've been doing a lot of walking.

Mercurows: Still, you were taking the long way just now, weren't you?

Mercurows: You clearly had several chances to come here directly.

Officer: We chose unmarked paths for secrecy's sake.

Officer: These paths have existed for much longer and they haven't been recorded on maps.

Mercurows: So that's how it is. You sure have put a lot of thought into this, Mr. Officer.

Mercurows: Thank you for your hard work!

Officer: You give us too much credit. Now then, we've brought you to the place where the Pike Node is stored.

Officer: As mentioned before, you can only remain for 10 minutes or so. Then we'll need to leave this place so that the next shift doesn't notice we've been here.

Mercurows: Okayyy!

Mercurows: Then, are you going to open the door now?

Mercurows: If the Pike Node bunker is behind the door, I'd like to see it soon.

Officer: It is as you say, the Pike Node is right behind this door.

Officer: But we don't have the codes for it. The protocol level is extremely high, and this base originally belonged to the former Soviet Army. I believe not even the Belgrade authorities are authorized to open this door.

Mercurows: So you brought me all the way here but you still can't let me see inside?

Officer: I'm sorry, but we can't.

Officer: We were simply showing our sincerity regarding our intentions to cooperate, just like you did.

Mercurows: Oh, that's fine, I can understand why you did it.

Mercurows: "I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself."

Mercurows: In terms of sincerity, what you've shown is certainly enough!

Officer: While I don't quite get what your verse is trying to convey, it's good that you can understand us.

Officer: Now then, what about the things you promised us? Can we take them?

Mercurows: Of course. Certainly. We will give you everything that we promised.

Mercurows: You've finished your mission, and I, "I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart..."

Mercurows: Can I hold you with that?

Officer: ...What are you saying?

Mercurows: A display of confusion, of danger, of failure. A display of weakness such as this, a display of death.

Mercurows: Both the one who shows it and the one who beholds it derive joy from these actions.

Officer: You...

Mercurows: Thank you for your hard work. Now, why don't you show me that look on your face.

A pair of black tentacles snake out past Mercurow's hands and lift the officer high above her head.

Mercurows: Ah, are you already unable to speak?

Mercurows: That's fine, you probably can't feel pain right now either!

Mercurows: Stay here forever, for your work is done.

Mercurows takes a step back and lifts the hem of her skirt in a curtsy to the already-dead officer.

Mercurows: Thank you. If not for your efforts in leading me here, who knows how much work I would have to do to find this place?

Mercurows: Now become a signpost here, an eternal memorial to your final journey.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: The officer's vital signs vanished... She killed that human...

AN-94: ...

AN-94 says nothing, but her grip tightens around her gun.

Mercurows: Hahaha, hahahaha!

Mercurows: This performance was a marvellous one too!

Mercurows: As the first time taking a bow since gaining a name of my own, I give this scene a nine out of ten!

Mercurows: You Dolls hiding over there, what do you think?

Mercurows: Come, step forward and dance with me!

ST AR-15: ...

Mercurows: There's no need to keep hiding, AR-15 and AN-94 of DEFY!

Mercurows: I only just realized, but the truth is you've been following me all this while, haven't you?

Mercurows: Like a dreamcatcher chasing the moon, futilely and fruitlessly gathering its light!

AN-94: What on earth is she saying...

Mercurows: The earth is a fortress, a keeper of secrets, the final resting place for everything.

Mercurows: Worthless things can only rot beneath its surface.

Mercurows: Just as a sleeping princess awaits her prince's kiss,

Mercurows: "If I am not the one who is awaited, then could it be you?"

ST AR-15: Don't move carelessly, she's faking—

Mercurows' tentacles lash out at AR-15's location with lightning speed, but AR-15 evades them a split second before they strike her directly, though the tentacles leave a faint scratch on her face.

AN-94: AR-15!

ST AR-15: I'm fine!

ST AR-15: What the hell...? The instant she touched me... it was as though something was LICKING my neural cloud...

AN-94: That's... exactly how I felt before... Was it a forced intrusion?!

Mercurows: Ah... so that's how it is...

Mercurows: So you're not the true prince after all.

Mercurows: I thought you sealed the interfaces to your neural cloud in order to keep something precious secret.

Mercurows: You really are clueless about everything, carrying out a pointless mission while being deceived.

Mercurows: It really is sad, both for you and that cat-loving Doll.

AN-94: AR-15, I'm picking up a large mass of white signals approaching us!

Mercurows: Boring... how boring...

Mercurows: Nimogen, there's no need to hold back anymore, let's dance!

Mercurows: It's just as Father said, lowly dust will never be able to rival the sparkling constellations!

Mercurows raises her right hand and points at the two members of DEFY.

Mercurows: "Because this inevitable reality of steel and dirt must pierce through the indifference of the sleepers and the deceased — even if they hide in the midst of ruin and the age."

ST AR-15: AN-94, we need to fall back...

Mercurows: —Die with gratitude in your hearts. "Shut your eyes for me and bring the dawn!"

ST AR-15: NOW!

...Alright, the time for chit-chat is over.

Angelia: Let's get started with what we ought to be doing.

Angelia: AK-12, what's the status of the quarantine wall?

AK-12: There are five points about three kilometers beyond the wall where infected creatures are gathering. The reason for that is unknown.

AK-12: According to visual inspection, those infected creatures don't seem to be in a stable condition. The garrison troops near the walls have not yet taken action.

AK-12: Also, according to the latest weather forecast, there might be stormy weather afterwards, which will lead to a big spike in the nearby radiation levels.

Angelia: A storm, huh... What terrible weather.

AK-12: The stormy weather might further agitate the Infected.

AK-12: If I were the officer in charge of the quarantine wall's security, now would be the time to disperse those monsters with firepower.

Angelia: That's impossible.

AK-12: Why?

AK-12: Isn't an important international conference about to take place in the city?

Angelia: The army will be cautious about using force precisely because of that.

Angelia: Besides, this place is no longer the nation's capital thanks to Collapse Fluid contamination. Just having sufficient forces to respond to emergencies is problematic in itself.

Angelia: Right now... Belgrade is nothing more than an ordinary city on the edge of a contaminated zone.

AK-12: So not many people are going to care about an abandoned capital?

Angelia: Exactly... Therefore there are fewer forces in reserve here. The various factions also have less strength here compared to other cities.

Angelia: I think that's the main reason why this place was chosen for this summit.

AK-12: Even if it comes with the risk of being attacked by infected creatures?

Angelia: Risk and reward come hand in hand.

Angelia: Besides... rather than the Infected, the other guys are what we should be focusing on.

AK-12: You mean the white ones?

Angelia: Yes... but not just them.

Ange looks down at the city below, and her expression grows severe.

Just then, a transmission comes in. She slowly raises a hand to accept it.

K: Statesec has arrived.

K: Griffin has also passed the test.

Angelia: I told you Griffin would be fine.

K: There will be more tests to come.

K: The Statesec agent teams will buy you time. I hope your efficiency doesn't disappoint them.

Angelia: Mm.

Ange hangs up.

This city is prosperous now, but how long will this prosperity last?

...

......

Team Defy continues surveying the situation near the wall from the vicinity of the memorial.

Ange finds AK-12 standing to the side of the memorial plaque. She seems to be inspecting something.

Angelia: What are you looking at, AK-12?

AK-12: I'm looking at this stone plaque.

AK-12: Why are there no names carved on it?

Angelia: ...Because a single plaque can't hold the names of everyone who needs to be remembered.

AK-12: So leaving it blank is a warning of sorts, then?

AK-12: Still, Ange, won't people come here?

Angelia: Why do you think that?

AK-12: Since it's a place used to remember one's deceased friends...surely people would come here frequently to pay homage to them, right?

Angelia: ...That is how it should have been.

Angelia: But this place has long since been forgotten by the people of the world.

AK-12: Forgotten?

Angelia: You must know, AK-12, that humans are forgetful creatures.

Angelia: For most people, it is only by forgetting part of the past that they can gain the courage to face the future.

Angelia: Unfortunately, this memorial plaque and the names it carries have already been placed into the category of things which need to be forgotten.

AK-12: So it's not just their names, but even the memorial plaque that commemorates them has been forgotten...

AK-12: It seems a little sad.

Angelia: They didn't die to earn your sympathy.

AK-12: "Your name is unknown, your deeds are immortal."

Angelia: Not everyone is willing to die for their country and what they believe in.

Angelia: Those people who sacrificed themselves for us ought to be remembered, no matter what reasons they had.

AK-12: You look like something's weighing on you. Is there something worrying you besides the mission?

Angelia: I was just being sentimental. Seeing this tombstone makes me think of a lot of my friends.

Angelia: Former friends.

Angelia: You should be able to understand that.

AK-12: Nyet... this is too difficult for a Doll to understand.

AK-12: Humans really are strange.

Angelia: Humph... you know, yet you pretend you don't.

Angelia: It seems we've drifted a little off-topic.

Angelia: In any case, this is now the most suitable location for us to hide and observe, so let's make good use of it.

AK-12: Since there's no need to worry about unexpected situations, why are we splitting our forces when we're only a single team to begin with?

Angelia: Their abilities are more than adequate for them to operate within the city, and we have other helpers there too.

Angelia: In comparison, I'm more worried about the purification towers and the quarantine wall. I need to keep my strongest force in reserve.

AK-12: Is she really your strongest? Isn't it because you felt she might be the most unpredictable factor?

Saying so, AK-12 directs her gaze toward M4A1, who is standing watch in the distance.

AK-12: It took us a long time to find her and AR-15, and we're still not clear what happened while they were gone.

Angelia: I believe that M4 will not be so easily shaken by the past.

AK-12: Leaving aside that long blank period, just that final battle with the Military would probably be enough to affect her.

AK-12: After all, that explosion engulfed the members of Griffin she once served with, and I can see how she blames herself even if she doesn't say it.

AK-12: Moreover, she ended up fighting one of the former members of the AR Team...

Angelia: Her kindness ended up being her undoing.

Angelia: I understand that kindness very well... but what can you protect with kindness alone?

Angelia: As long as you bear the weight of duty, you'll have to walk down this path in the end. You'll harm other people, and harm yourself even more.

AK-12: I don't doubt her... She performed adequately back then.

AK-12: I'm simply worried about whether she can continue fighting as a Tactical Doll.

Angelia: If you really are that worried about her, then why don't you go have a chat with her?

AK-12: Humph... I just knew you'd dump this troublesome crap on me.

...Near the nameless plaque.

M4 is carrying out her duty and standing watch nearby.

Just then, AK-12 walks over to her.

M4A1: Is something the matter?

AK-12: Oh, it's nothing. Just that you looked really bored, so I thought I ought to go show some care and concern for a teammate.

M4A1: I don't need your care or concern. Let's just do our jobs.

AK-12: You've become more distant ever since you came back.

AK-12: How does returning to the team feel, M4?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: I don't want to talk about this now.

AK-12: So?

AK-12: Seems you only like talking to yourself, is that it?

M4A1: What do you mean by that?

AK-12: I wonder...

M4A1: I'm not the sort of person who talks to themselves. It's just that right now... I'm not in the mood for idle chatter.

AK-12: Is it because you want to focus on your mission or because... your partner in conversation isn't the other you?

M4A1: ...

AK-12: Forget it, just stay this way.

AK-12: The more mysterious you become, the more amusing it is to observe you.

With that, AK-12 leaves M4's side.

M4A1: ...Did she... notice something?

You don't know how to hide it at all.

Even if you fake a poker face, others can see right into your heart.

M4A1: Shut up. I wouldn't even need to do this if not for you.

Clear Voice: I would have thought that we had a relationship of mutual trust after going through so much together.

M4A1: I have never trusted you. At the very most, we've just used each other.

Clear Voice: You wound me. I thought we were quite happy working together before.

M4A1: Tsk... I had no other choice but to do so at the time.

Clear Voice: There will be more and more situations where you will have no other choice as time goes by.

Clear Voice: Still, that's fine. At the very least, you've accepted my existence.

Clear Voice: My patience is boundless when it comes to dealing with you.

M4A1: I won't forget how you lied to me in the past. If you want to obtain what you want, then serve me obediently, OGAS.

The Voice of OGAS: We're both looking for the path back to ourselves, aren't we?

Let's walk hand in hand as we travel the road of recollection towards the truth, my sister.
Part 2

...Click.

...The transmission begins.

ST AR-15: That doesn't mean she had to run off on her own... I'll catch up and follow the vehicle with her.

ST AR-15: If we do find the "Node", should we destroy it immediately?

ST AR-15: What on earth could it be...?

Angelia: You don't need to know. The moment you find something like it, wait for my order and destroy it on the spot.

ST AR-15: ...Understood.

ST AR-15: This channel isn't secure. I'll find some way to contact you after I catch up with AN-94.

AK-12: Ange, something isn't quite right over here.

Angelia: Acknowledged.

Angelia: I'll be waiting for the two of you to contact me again, AR-15.

Ange ends her transmission with AR-15.

Angelia: What happened?

AK-12: Something's happening at the wall.

AK-12: You asked me to keep an eye on the local garrison units in addition to the infected creatures beyond the wall.

AK-12: According to my previous observations, they've been patrolling according to a fixed pattern.

AK-12: But just now, some of them broke off from their original patrol routes and began to assemble at the wall.

Angelia: Were they hacked by the enemy?

AK-12: Nyet...

AK-12: I didn't detect any external signals.

AK-12: The units that broke off are now using a new IFF signal in place of their original one. The signal characteristics...are that of the White Faction.

Angelia: "The leaves always wither after the roots rot."

Angelia: So it's not just within the city, but here too...

AK-12: Ange, what should we do now?

Angelia: You and M4 head over to the quarantine wall. Conduct recon and gather information there.

Angelia: We'll decide on our next move depending on the situation.

...Several minutes later.

AK-12 and M4A1 reach the wall district.

AK-12: Ange, we've got a mutiny here.

AK-12: The defenders inside the wall have split into two forces and are currently engaged in battle.

AK-12: I'm sending you the data on the situation.

Angelia: Got it, understood.

AK-12: Should we stay here and continue observing?

Angelia: ...No.

Angelia: AK-12, M4A1, the two of you will now assist the wall defenders in wiping out the rebel troops.

AK-12: Ange, are you sure? Using military force on foreign territory, even if it's to wipe out rebel troops...

Angelia: When did you start being so indecisive?

AK-12: Don't get mad... I just want to make sure if you really want us to carry out this order.

AK-12: You need to think about the consequences of doing so.

Angelia: Of course I know what the consequences are, AK-12.

AK-12: So we'll be pointing our guns at humans then, is that it?

Angelia: According to the information you sent, there aren't many humans among the rebels. The bulk of their fighting strength is made up of automaton units and mechs.

Angelia: Destroy their automatons, wreck their mechs, ease the pressure on the defenders... That's all you need to do. It'll be enough.

Angelia: Of course, if you have no choice, then you need to be prepared to open fire on human beings.

M4A1: Ange, while I don't mean to second-guess your orders, is it really wise to intervene in a firefight that's unrelated to the mission?

M4A1: Isn't our aim to find and destroy the Pike Node?

Angelia: This is most definitely not "unrelated to the mission", M4.

Angelia: What the rebels and the White Faction are doing is definitely linked to the Pike Node.

M4A1: Why do you think so?

Angelia: That's because the same thing is happening on the other side of the city.

M4A1: The peace conference, huh... You think this is a coordinated attack by the White Faction?

M4A1: Even so, it doesn't prove that this conflict is more important than finding the Pike Node...

Angelia: Waiting until you have "completely confirmed" information before acting invariably leads to regrettable consequences.

Angelia: You should understand that better than me.

M4A1: But...

Angelia: M4, why are you so fixated on the Pike Node?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: I just want to complete the mission.

AK-12: Although I'm inclined to agree with M4's opinion...

AK-12: It can't be helped. Whatever you say, goes.

Angelia: Since you understand, hurry up and get moving.

AK-12: In that case...

AK-12: Task Force DEFY will begin a new operation.

...Several minutes after Task Force DEFY joins the battle.

...A transmission comes through.

AK-12: Eh, at a time like this...

Angelia: Sounds like you've already started fighting.

AK-12: We're wiping out a few defensive automatons while approaching the location where the defenders and rebels are exchanging fire.

AK-12: Ange, if you're contacting us now... I trust it isn't good news, is it?

Angelia: Correct.

Angelia: The storm's begun, and it's driving the infected creatures closer to the wall.

AK-12: Ugh... That'll make things difficult.

AK-12: Given the situation at the wall now...it looks like they won't be able to defend it at full strength.

Angelia: Worse still, the storm will intensify the speed of infection... Belgrade's defenders may end up facing several times the number of Infected they were expecting.

Angelia: You need to move faster before the situation becomes irrecoverable!

Angelia: There really isn't much time left!

...In a passage within the quarantine wall.

AK-12: There really are a lot of autonomous units here...

M4A1: It's understandable for them to be present in such numbers in order to make up for the shortfall of soldiers.

AK-12: Still, they're making our job more troublesome.

AK-12: Perhaps we should explain ourselves to the defenders to clear up their suspicions about us. That'll facilitate our future actions greatly.

M4A1: ...I disagree.

M4A1: We can't reveal DEFY's existence so easily.

AK-12: But if the situation remains as it is, our mission will incur additional risk.

M4A1: Let me think, there must be some other way...

AK-12: Some other way? Now I'm kind of looking forward to it.

AK-12: Still, you'd better come up with it quickly... Time is running out for us.
Part 3

3

M4 and AK-12 steadily move deeper into the region where the defenders and the rebels are fighting.

AK-12: We've nearly cleared out the units in the sector around the lowest levels.

AK-12: We're going to head up. After this, we'll be making direct contact with human rebels.

AK-12: M4, are you ready?

M4A1: ...Wait a moment.

AK-12: What's the matter?

AK-12 walks over to M4's side and finds that she is inspecting a human collapsed by the wall.

AK-12: This man's one of the wall's defenders. Huh, seems to be an officer, too.

AK-12: As a human, he must have had a hard time holding out here by himself for so long.

M4A1: He's still alive... Was he blasted off the side of the wall?

M4A1: Are you alright? Can you hear me?

(Groans) Who...are you...?

M4A1: I'm here to save you.

M4A1: Hang in there, we'll get you out of here.

AK-12: Are you serious about this, M4?

M4A1: Of course. I'll take him to a safe place.

M4A1: It won't take much time.

AK-12: Just now you were saying that joining this battle would lead to unnecessary complications, and now you're going to create an unnecessary complication of your own?

M4A1: I have my way of doing things.

M4A1: You stick to the plan and head to the upper level. I'll catch up with you soon.

AK-12: You really do like doing things your own way... Fair enough.

AK-12: Let me see what this unnecessary complication brings us.

AK-12: I'll make a move first, then.

AK-12 leaves.

Thank you, young lady...

M4A1: Please bear with this for a little longer, I'm going to take you to a safe place where you can take shelter.

(Coughs) No need for that...

...Head to the frontlines, more people need you there.

M4A1: Right now, you need me more.

...

...

M4 carries the officer into a sealed area where the quarantine wall segments are joined and gives him basic first-aid for his wounds.

M4A1: The bleeding's stopped, you should be fine now.

Thanks for the rescue.

M4A1: No need to thank me, this is my duty.

You don't seem to be from our unit.

(Coughs heavily) ...Have things reached the point where we need to put a girl like you on the frontlines...?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: It's fine, I'm a Tactical Doll.

What? I can't believe Dolls are so realistic now...

Oh, but still, thank you and whoever sent you to help us.

M4A1: My order is to help your unit repel the rebels.

M4A1: In order to facilitate our movements, I hope you will tell your comrades not to attack me and my companion.

(Cough) ...Alright...

What's your IFF signal...?

M4A1: I'll send it to you now.

The garrison officer picks up the radio on his webbing and opens a communications channel.

Attention all units...

The designated Tactical Dolls have been sent by our side to provide support... Do not attack them...

...

Will that do?

M4A1: That's enough. Thank you for your cooperation.

Can you tell me who sent you to help us?

M4A1: ...We just happened to be passing by.

Is that so...? I understand.

You have to stop them, otherwise the entire city will be doomed...

M4A1: Understood. They won't get their way.

M4A1: Take care of yourself.

...M4 returns to the wall passage and meets up with AK-12.

M4A1: I've solved the problem that was troubling you.

AK-12: Yeah, I heard it all over the radio.

AK-12: Did you plan this?

M4A1: I just happened to come across an opportunity and took advantage of it.

M4A1: It was all for the sake of making the operation more successful.

M4A1: Also, Ange doesn't want to see unnecessary casualties.

AK-12: ...Is that really the case?

M4A1: What are you trying to say?

AK-12: No matter how much you try to pretend you're a cold machine, you can't run away from who you are inside.

AK-12: I won't hate you, even if you don't cover it up.

M4A1: ...I didn't do it to make you like me.

AK-12: I understand.

AK-12: Go do whatever you want, provided it doesn't jeopardize the mission.

AK-12: That way, I'll be able to see more interesting things.

M4A1: ...You have terrible hobbies.

AK-12: It's not like it's going to do you any harm now, is it?

M4A1: Whatever, do as you please.

(It's not just who I am inside that I can't escape, but OGAS as well... What should I do from now on...?)

...Inside the quarantine wall.

M4 and AK-12 support the defenders in an intense clash with the rebels.

M4A1: The enemy offensive seems to have tapered off.

M4A1: AK-12, are they making any new moves?

AK-12: The defenders are steadily encircling the rebels at the top of the wall.

AK-12: The rebel forces have been cut in half and one of those halves is trying to escape...

M4A1: Pathetic. To think they'd abandon their units to run away...

AK-12: Still, there's something weird here. The scans show that the fleeing rebels are heading toward the base of the wall.

M4A1: If they're retreating, that position would end up being flanked. It's not suitable for defense. There must be something fishy going on.

AK-12 connects to the comms network and reports the situation to Ange.

AK-12: Did you hear that, Ange? The enemy's situation is a little abnormal. I've already sent you the distribution of their forces.

Angelia: The enemy's gathering at the base of the wall, huh...

Angelia: Tsk... the surrounded rebel troops might just be bait. They've discovered that they can't seize control access for the entire quarantine wall and so they're using their backup plan.

Angelia: That other group of rebels is probably going to try and seize the sector containing the wall control room, and then they'll try to open the wall up! You need to get to the control room and stop the rebels before they make their move!
Part 4

    4chevron_right

...

...

M4 and AK-12 swiftly break through the enemy defense line and arrive at the door to the wall control room.

M4A1: ...The door's locked.

AK-12: Hang on a bit, I'm hacking the internal control systems of the wall.

M4A1: Hurry it up, there's no telling what the people inside are doing.

AK-12: I'm working as fast as I can.

AK-12: After all, this equipment is intended to protect human lives, so obviously they'd be more careful about protecting it.

AK-12: ...

AK-12: Alright, opening the door now.

M4A1: Understood.

AK-12 opens the electronic lock, and the two Dolls rush into the control room.

A soldier is operating the control panel in front of them.

M4A1: You've got nowhere to run. Surrender.

The rebel soldier ignores M4's warning and continues pressing the buttons on the control panel.

AK-12: This is bad! M4, he's planning to open the quarantine wall!

M4 quickly steps forward and points her gun at the rebel's back.

M4A1: Stop what you're doing and raise your hands if you don't want to die.

The rebel soldier turns back and looks at M4 with a disdainful expression on his face.

A huge red warning message flashes on the monitor before him.

A mere puppet like you can't stop us!

The rebel soldier quickly reaches a hand out to a button on the control panel.

M4 shoots the rebel soldier square in the head, and the soldier collapses in front of the control panel like a sack of potatoes.

M4A1: Is it over...?

M4 bites her lip as she looks at the human who now lies in a pool of blood.

M4A1: (...Is this really alright?)

You hesitated, M4A1.

Your indecision nearly put the entire city in danger. And here I thought you were already used to killing human beings.

M4A1: ...Was there really no other way to stop him? Why does it always have to be a matter of life and death?!

You're naive, far too naive. Don't always think that you can reach a good outcome easily.

Only the victors get to live on. That was why you opened fire, isn't that right?

M4A1: ...

M4A1, we need to do the right thing.

That's the only way we can reach our destination...

Just then, someone pats M4's shoulder.

M4A1: ?!

AK-12: Talking to yourself again, M4?

AK-12: Things aren't over yet.

M4A1: What?

AK-12 points to the communicator that has fallen beside the rebel soldier's body.

The faint sounds of a conversation can be heard through the device.

Attention, the operation to seize the control room has failed...

Thus we have no choice but to enact the final plan.

AK-12: As I thought...

AK-12 and M4 exchange looks.

After that, M4 dashes out of the control room.

AK-12: I've finished pinpointing the message's source, I'll send you its location.

M4A1: Roger.

M4A1: I'm on my way, delay them as long as you can.

AK-12 picks up the communicator.

...A low male voice comes from it.

Whoever's in the control room, you heard our conversation, right?

Unfortunately, everything you did was for nothing!

AK-12: You've already failed. If you want to keep your lives, I'd advise you to not act rashly.

Failed? Hahahaha... To think it'd be a little girl who stormed the control room!

Still, I'll tell you this. In order to ensure our plan went off without a hitch, our heroes have already rigged the load-bearing columns here with explosives while you fools were delayed by our comrades!

And now, I hold the detonator.

With just a press, this stupid quarantine wall will be blown to bits!

AK-12: Why are you doing this? Weren't you originally garrison troops?

AK-12: Your duty is to protect your people!

AK-12: Can you face up to the badges you wear if you let infected creatures into the city?

Of course we can! What we're doing is for the sake of peace and freedom!

As for the people? (Snorts) ...They aren't even people!

Our people are locked outside the wall! The real people are starving, bleeding, struggling on the edge of life and death!

We use our blood to protect those maggots in the city, but what have they done?

They simply live within the walls without a care in the world, allowing those thieves who live on high to steal the fruits that we protect with our lives!

Let them bear the consequences of their weakness! Let them go to hell with the people up top!

AK-12: Do you want to die?!

AK-12: If you push that button, both you and the rest of your unit will perish!

This is the battlefield, girl!

Since we're here, we have no intention of going back alive!

All our comrades came here prepared to die. How could soft and weak running dogs like you understand our lofty resolve?!

AK-12: You... You're a bunch of madmen!

That's right, we're mad! We're all mad!!!

Everything's gone mad — hahahaha!!!!

AK-12: M4! Look out!

AK-12: These people are all insane!

M4A1: Got it, I'll be right—

Let this mad world hear our cry!!!!!

BOOM!

The purification tower collapses amidst a series of explosions.

The storm lashing the exterior of the walls quickly disperses the thick smoke generated by the blasts.

By the time the dust and smoke clear, Ange can see a horde of burning Infected by the light of the fires on the nearby wall. They pour in through the gap in the quarantine wall and rush downhill into the city.

Ange can hear many things.

She can hear screams, gunfire, explosions, and inhuman cries.

Those sounds of disaster blend into a chaotic mess and reach her ears over the communications channel.

The neat flow of cars on the streets near the wall seizes up, like a snake that's been cut into segments.

The thick smoke and firelight gradually spread outward along the streets. People flee in all directions, and Ange imagines she can hear their wails of despair.

Even Ange, who has witnessed countless tragic sights, cannot help but want to avert her eyes as she witnesses the horrific scene beneath her.

Did your plan account for this too, K...?

It had better, otherwise the situation will be out of my control...

...Half an hour later.

Outside the conference hall.

RO635: At this rate... No...the entire city will be overrun!

The Infected surge towards the city center from all directions. RO635 and the Commander's team are all but surrounded by the swarm outside the conference hall.

RO635: Commander, we can't fight them all...!

RO635: This place is going to be completely swamped by the infected creatures soon! We've got to retreat to the cathedral!

Click—

All of a sudden, K's voice comes through the comms channel once again.

K: Is that all Griffin's got?

RO635: Damn this guy who only knows how to jeer on the other end of the line!

K: Your lives are insignificant, but if anything happens to the VIP, there won't be any reason for Griffin to exist anymore.

Commander: Tsk...we're still within range of the 30mm cannon. They'll try to snipe us again the moment we leave the building's cover!

K: Their artillery position has been neutralized.

Commander: Was that the agents' doing?

K: Yes, but it was a suicide mission. They bought you this chance with their own lives.

Commander: ...They have my deepest gratitude. RO, get all teams to prepare for action and get ready to move the VIP!

RO635: On foot...?! But under these circumstances...

Commander: We're just sitting ducks if we stay here! Go!

RO635: Got it! SOP-II, have the other teams standby on our flanks. We're moving!

Kalina: Commander, you'd better come over here!

Commander: What is it?

Kalina: Chairwoman Ulrich is regaining consciousness... I don't know how to explain the situation to her...

Commander: That's alright, leave it to me.

Commander: Madam Chairwoman, can you hear me?

Chairwoman Ulrich: (Groans) It hurts... What happened...?

Commander: Please keep calm and listen to me.

Commander: The conference was sabotaged. ELIDs have breached the city. We are the last of your security detail. From here on out, it is imperative that you heed our instructions. We will protect you and lead you to safety.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Un...understood... Is it a terrorist attack? Ambassador Roshchin was...

Commander: I'm sorry, it was all very sudden. I'm afraid most of the security personnel within the conference hall were lost. So was Ambassador Roshchin.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Oh...

Commander: You look a lot less stricken than I expected.

Chairwoman Ulrich: You don't have to worry too much about me. This isn't the first time I've found myself in a crisis.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Besides, I was fully prepared to die here before I even arrived.

Commander: You will NOT die here. RO, are you still there?

RO635: All teams are fully prepared. We're ready to move anytime.

Commander: Alright. Madam Chairwoman, this is RO635, my adjutant on the field. She'll be your bodyguard.

RO635: Me?

Commander: Can you do it? I'll command the other teams to clear a path ahead. You and your team are to escort the Chairwoman and ensure her safety.

RO635: Yes, Commander. I won't let a single hair on her head be harmed.

RO635 shields the Chairwoman as they seek cover.

RO635: Sorry for making you see such a horrific scene...

RO635: I'm Tactical Doll RO635 from Griffin. From now on, I'll be in charge of your personal safety.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Thank you.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Though I'm not sure I'm actually that important...

RO635: I heard your speech just now. The world needs people like you who can truly bring about peace, so you cannot die here.

RO635: The Commander and my team of Tactical Dolls are going to keep you safe!

Several minutes later... In a certain district in Belgrade.

The Griffin entourage is moving at high speed.

Unlike the Dolls around her, the Chairwoman is starting to lose her breath.

Noticing the Chairwoman's distress, RO635 orders her team to stop.

RO635: Madam, we'll take a short break here.

Chairwoman Ulrich: S...Sorry...for slowing you down...

RO635: It's okay. The roads have been temporarily sealed off by barricades. The Commander is trying to open the way up for us, so we're going to have to stop and wait for the word from our teams ahead anyway.

RO635: Not to mention that the cathedral we're heading to isn't too far from here. Stopping briefly to recover your strength is no big deal.

Chairwoman Ulrich: The cathedral...?

Chairwoman Ulrich: I remember that there's a residential area not far from here.

Chairwoman Ulrich: I wonder if the terrorist attack has affected the local residents...

RO635: Don't worry, Madam. Our reinforcements will be here very soon.

RO635: (I hope...)

???: Really? Do you actually have reinforcements?

RO635: !!

RO635: Who's that?!

The scornful snicker among the cacophony of gunfire is exceptionally grating on the ear. RO635 positions herself in front of the Chairwoman and eyes the person warily.

Mysterious Girl: Lying is a bad habit, RO635~ Just be a good girl and hand me that woman, so that you can die in peace later.

RO635: Are you a Nyto?! Everyone, suppressive fire!

Mysterious Girl: Nyto? Please, could you not insult me with that tasteless name?

Mysterious Girl: I am Nimogen, your undertaker.

Mysterious Girl: Now, how should I arrange your corpses? Heeheeheehee~

With that, the white mechs behind her launch a barrage at RO635's team.

RO635: Are you crazy?!

RO635: You don't care if you end up killing your target?!

Nimogen: Father never said he wanted her alive though?

Nimogen: Or should I say, it'd actually make my job easier if she's dead? Heeheehee, now you have you answer, so just die!

The black-clad Nimogen grins psychotically, not the slightest bit bothered by the blood splashed onto her clothes and cheek during the massacre. She merely keeps smirking as she commands the white units in attacking RO635 and the Chairwoman.

RO635's team protect their target in a hasty retreat, all the while fending off the infected creatures that periodically charge at them...

RO635: C-Commander! This is RO635!

RO635: The enemy has ambushed us from behind! It's a Nyto with Paradeus units!

RO635: We're no match against their overwhelming firepower...cough... We need support!

Commander: They intercepted us and now we're also under attack! I'm trying to break through and get to you! Hang in there!

RO635 and the Chairwoman find cover behind some obstacles, but the laughter of the mysterious girl keeps getting closer, and the tremors in the ground becomes more violent with every explosion.

RO635: Tsk, that's some insane firepower...

RO635: We can't huddle here forever. Will we make it? Before the Commander gets here...

RO635: If I can draw that Nyto away, there might still be a chance...

RO635: Dammit... Here goes nothing!
Part 2

2

...In the streets.

The Griffin entourage is moving through the streets in careful formation.

Other than the Infected who are oblivious to their own tragic fate, the battlefield is littered with broken bodies.

RO635 guns down another batch of ELIDs, then notices something all of a sudden.

RO635: (A blue signal ID...)

RO635: (A Griffin Doll that's unaccounted for?)

RO635 gestures at her teammate to keep quiet and stay close, then she moves cautiously to a pile of rubble. Behind a metal panel sprinkled with bullet holes, she finds a distraught Doll, clutching at her chest and shivering uncontrollably.

Before her lies the remains of an Infected blasted beyond recognition.

RO635: Are...you okay?

The gray-haired Doll doesn't reply.

RO635: Are you a Griffin Doll?

RO635: Are you part of the surveillance team that we lost contact with...? We have some new recruits on this operation... You're HS2000, aren't you? I've read your file.

The girl lifts her head, showing a face full of fear...and shame.

HS2000: I'm sorry... I-I'm so scared...

HS2000: He... That man...

RO635: ...Where are your teammates?

HS2000: They...for me... I'm...I'm sorry... I was too scared...

HS2000: I didn't know how to respond to the situation... My neural cloud was completely blank... I couldn't move...

RO635: Calm down. Look at me.

HS2000: If I could fight properly, my teammates wouldn't have...

HS2000: But...I'm just a Medical Doll...

RO635: I didn't see so many dead bodies on my first mission - I was a lot luckier than you.

RO635: Which is why you, whose first mission is to repel ELIDs on the battlefield, are so much braver.

HS2000: But...I...

RO635: You're facing enemies that shouldn't have been yours to face - this courage alone is commendable.

RO635: So stop blaming yourself. What matters now is to survive.

HS2000 looks up. Beyond her initial panic, RO635 now sees a glint of surprise and gratitude in her eyes.

RO635: I suppose you don't want to suddenly find yourself back at the base in a brand spanking new body with no memory of what has happened before, right?

HS2000: I...don't want that...

HS2000: RO635 looks around vigilantly and taps HS2000 gently on the shoulder.

RO635: Then try not to get hit. Just survive for now, okay?

RO635: Now that you've rejoined our main force, let's all do our best to go home without a scratch.

With a wavering gleam in her eyes, HS2000 finally nods at RO635.

She gets on her feet unsteadily and jogs over to the group of Griffin Dolls.

RO635 gets up and walks away once she's made sure the Doll has settled in.

RO635: If I could help it, I really wouldn't want these girls to experience something so cruel.
Part 3

...At the memorial of nameless martyrs.

At the sight of the quarantine wall and purification tower being reduced to rubble, as well as the swarming ELIDs, Ange clenches her fists.

She feels a searing rage but can't muster a way to express it.

Ange: The purification tower is destroyed.

Ange: There are traitors among the garrison troops on the wall. The rebels have also blasted through the quarantine wall.

K: Just make your point.

Ange: You knew about this, didn't you?! Didn't you say Statesec had eliminated the infiltrators?! They haven't done anything, haven't they!

K: It's impossible, even for Statesec, to sniff out every single traitor. Miscalculations are inevitable.

Ange: Tsk...there are too many ELIDs and I don't have enough people, not to mention the oncoming storm. Time is short. I need you to send in more troops to lend me support near the wall.

K: I can't.

Ange: Why?!

Ange: Didn't we agree that you'd provide backup in the case of an emergency?!

Ange: ...I just need them to round off the ELIDs; that's hardly an unreasonable request!

K: The agents have practically been wiped out. I don't have any more men to send.

Ange: ...Wiped...out?

Ange: How could that be? What about the backup teams?

K: There aren't any. Those were all we got from the Head of Operations.

Ange: ...

Ange: Why did they not take such an important conference seriously?

Ange: I'll recall my team and head over to the conference hall right away.

K: That won't be necessary. Continue with your recon work.

Ange: But Ambassador Roshchin...

K: He's dead.

Ange: ...

K: Don't let their sacrifices be in vain. Continue your mission.

Ange: "Don't let their sacrifices be in vain..."

Ange: A terrifying idea suddenly occurred to me... Care to listen to my suspicions?

K: Did these suspicions form over the last few seconds?

K: I believe I'm not obliged to listen, nor am I obliged to offer you any explanation—

Ange: I couldn't detect even a sliver of shock in your voice.

Ange: Even with a will of steel, anyone would at least waver a little in the face of such a crisis...

Ange: So I can't help but suspect that everything...

K: ...

K: You're overthinking it. As a Statesec agent, you simply have to do your job. That's the only thing you're good for.

Ange: Humph, and here I thought I was a renegade.

K: All the more reason why you need me.

Ange: Do I though?

K: You think you're oh-so-amazing just because you pulled a few crazy stunts in the past?

K: Of course you need me if you still want to complete your objective.

Ange: ...

K: I have no wish to concern myself with what you have done or who you used to be. Those things mean nothing to me.

K: Right now, I'm the only one who can tell where your loyalties lie, and only I can truly protect you.

K: I hope you can remember that and refrain from making unnecessary comments in the future. Resume your mission.

Ange: ...

Ange ends the transmission and silently looks into the distance.
Part 4

4

...In the streets.

RO635 attempts to fire at Nimogen from the side, but her target dodges the attack with ease.

Suddenly extending her tentacles, Nimogen grabs RO635 by the ankles and flings her brutally from the height of two stories onto the ground. Before RO635 can scramble to her feet, Nimogen is already right before her, resting a foot on her chest and leering at her impishly.

RO635: ...Get your filthy foot off me.

Nimogen: It wasn't actually all that satisfying, but I suppose you've already done the best you could as a piece of junk.

Nimogen: Heeheehee, so this is all Griffin amounts to!

BOOM!

All of a sudden, a grenade explodes right where Nimogen was just a second ago.

RO635 crawls out from within the smokescreen and dashes behind the nearest cover.

RO635: Are you trying to blow me to pieces, SOP-II?!

That grenade interrupted Nimogen's attempt on RO635's life just in time.

In the smokescreen, a figure flits behind cover at lightning speed.

With an equally creepy grin, she peers at the black-clad girl just meters away.

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, my bad. It wasn't on purpose...

M4 SOPMOD II: Anyway, I'm here!

SOP-II flashes a smile at the piece of cover that RO635 is hiding behind and loads her weapon with another grenade.

Nimogen: Oh wow, looks like the real fun has finally got here. Heeheehee, now this is more like it~

M4 SOPMOD II: Hmm? Are all Nytos so snotty these days? Still weak as ever, but your blabbing skills sure have improved~

Nimogen: I said I'm not Ny⁠—

M4 SOPMOD II: Nyto is Nyto, just as trash is trash. Even if you're something different, as long as you're categorized as trash, I don't care.

Nimogen: Heehee, now I'm starting to get angry. The last person who riled me up got turned into a bloody sludge. Unfortunately, Dolls can only become a pile of scrap metal.

M4 SOPMOD II: Humph, still spouting rubbish, I see. If you could scare me, my name wouldn't be SOP-II!

Nimogen: It appears that you still harbor some misconceptions about me. I really must clear them up...before I lop your head off your shoulders, heeheehee~

RO635: SOP-II...we've got to find a way to get the Chairwoman out of here! We can't afford to waste too much time on her!

RO635: The Commander said they're almost done clearing the way to the cathedral!

M4 SOPMOD II: Then we'll just have to make this a draw! Easy-peasy~

Nimogen: Heeheehee... That's the spirit! I like you~

Nimogen: Now, show me what you've got!

Bang bang! Bang bang bang!

The two exchange fire.

SOP-II's firepower isn't strong enough to actually repel the girl in black, but it's enough to slow her down.

Seizing this opportunity, RO635 retreats with the Chairwoman.

RO635: This is RO635! I have rendezvoused with the rescue team and am now trying to evade enemy pursuit!

Kalina: Received!

Kalina: Just head straight to the cathedral! Our assault team has secured the road, but the enemy is relentless in their attacks so we can't hold them off for long!

RO635: Roger that! We'll be right there!

BOOM!

The laughter is even more eerie amidst the sound of artillery.

Defending against Nimogen's onslaught, SOP-II has no wish to linger in battle. She creates traps every now and then to put more distance between Nimogen and herself.

RO635: Nicely done, SOP-II!

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, this is more like it! It's much more interesting than fighting the cannon fodder from before!

Nimogen: Is that all it takes to impress you?

RO635: SOP-II, watch out!

Nimogen suddenly darts forward and wraps her tentacle around SOP-II's neck. Just as she thinks victory is hers, SOP-II tears off the tentacle and drags Nimogen towards herself, then delivers a massive kick that sends her flying off.

M4 SOPMOD II: Game over~

SOP-II launches a grenade in the same direction. It lands on the ground at the same time as Nimogen. With her back to the violent explosion in the distance, SOP-II pulls RO out from behind her cover.

M4 SOPMOD II: Sorry, RO. I didn't obey your order to make it a draw.

RO635: You only know how to show off, don't you... Never mind, let's hurry and regroup with the Commander!

...Outside the cathedral.

Under the Commander's command, the Dolls eliminate the remaining ELIDs around the perimeters and establish a defense line around the cathedral.

Kalina: K's intel isn't accurate! He said we should be able to break through in one go!

Kalina: Can we even last that long under such heavy fire?!

Kalina: And there are simply way too many ELIDs in the area!

Lewis: (Gags) All these fluids are disgusting!

Lewis: Positively repugnant! Even I can't bear it any longer!

P22: Just hang in there for a bit. The security entourage hasn't made it here yet. We've got to keep this up until they bring the VIP and regroup with us...

P22: Good news! Look, they're here!

...Ten minutes later.

Somewhere on the battlefield.

Nimogen: Heeheehee... Never mind...

Nimogen: It's okay, don't sweat it. It doesn't hurt to let the rats have some fun. After all...

Nimogen: I will eventually reduce you all to ashes.

Nimogen: That's right...I will burn the living hell out of you!

Nimogen: Heehee... Unforgivable... Utterly unforgivable!

Nimogen: I'm going to tear you apart piece by piece! Just you wait... Just you wait!

...15 minutes later.

At the cathedral.

M4 SOPMOD II: It's the Commander!

RO635: You're back!

Commander: Yep, it's safe outside for the time being, and the HOCs have also been deployed in secure sectors.

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, mission accomplished! RO and I have brought the VIP with us!

RO635: (Hey, don't fish for compliments the moment you see the Commander...)

M4 SOPMOD II: Heheh, but we deserve to be praised for completing the mission!

Commander: Sorry but you won't have time to rest up.

Commander: There is still a considerable amount of Paradeus units and infected creatures out there... Our situation hasn't improved all that much.

M4 SOPMOD II: No problem! I'll be fine as long as there are enemies to kill!

M4 SOPMOD II: We even ran into the commander of those white things! She tried to take the VIP from RO but I took care of her with a "BOOM"!

M4 SOPMOD II: It's just a bit of a shame that I couldn't get a piece of her as souvenir...

Kalina: ...Thank goodness you didn't bring back some weird body part...

Kalina: I don't think my heart could take it otherwise...

M4 SOPMOD II: Still, that "person" was really strange. She looked like a Nyto but insisted that she wasn't.

M4 SOPMOD II: And the way she smiled... How should I put it...? It gave me the chills!

My heart misses a beat at the sound of that.

Did SOP-II feel what I felt...? I knew it - it was a Nyto that I saw... What is she planning in secret...?

An uncanny sense of foreboding is gradually expanding in my mind.

Commander: SOP-II, have you really eliminated that Nyto?

M4 SOPMOD II: She called herself Nimogen and claimed to be different than the other Nytos. She was just plain weird... I launched a grenade at her, but I don't know if it actually killed her. Should I go back and look for her body?

Commander: No, thank you, SOP-II. You've done enough.

An unsettling smile... The attempt to abduct the VIP... The assault in the conference hall and on our Dolls... These must all be related, but I simply don't have enough time to think about that. It's challenging enough just to stand our ground here in the cathedral.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Are you okay?

The gentle question pulls my thoughts back to the tense present.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Is...everything alright?

Chairwoman Ulrich: You've been looking very grim.

Commander: I'm fine... Excuse me.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Um... I know I shouldn't interrupt you, but...

Chairwoman Ulrich: There are refugees and children seeking shelter in the cathedral. May I ask when your reinforcements will arrive?

Commander: Reinforcements...will have to take some time to get here.

Commander: Please stay inside the building. It's too dangerous outside.

Commander: Kalina, protect the Chairwoman!

Kalina: Right, Madam, please come inside the cathedral with me. It's very dangerous here.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Alright...

Chairwoman Ulrich walks toward the cathedral, but turns back halfway.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Commander, you don't seem to be a local, nor do you look like an agent from the Bureau of State Security. Who exactly...

Commander: I'm nothing more than someone from a struggling PMC.

After reining in my facial expression, I quickly brief RO635 on the current tactical situation and our plan of action.

RO635: I've reorganized our vanguard teams but it still doesn't seem to be enough...

RO635: What do we do next?

RO635: We've already suffered very heavy losses in the previous fight. I don't think we'll be able to maintain our defense line for very long in a battle of attrition.

BOOM!

Waves of the explosive blasts come crashing through, affecting even the interior of the cathedral. One can just about hear the shattering of some works of art, as if they've been abandoned by God.

RO635: Dammit, another barrage. They're trying to reduce our numbers before the next round of attack. Commander, what do we do?

Commander: We have no choice but to abandon this position, but the cathedral can probably still buy us some time...

Commander: Kalina, are the comms still down?

Kalina: I haven't been able to get in touch with our logistics teams. I've been attempting to contact K on my radio communicator, but the interference is really bad so I'm still trying!

Commander: Tsk... How much longer will be we able to stop these bastards with just us...?

BOOOOM!

Another blast wave rolls in, and the T-Dolls barely manage to keep their formation intact.

RO635: Commander, you'll be in danger if we don't go now!

Commander: Dammit! All teams, retreat into the cathedral!

...Ten minutes later.

Inside the cathedral.

Once the teams have settled in, we started mounting our defenses against fire from outside the building.

Fortunately, thanks to the distance, we weren't affected by any enemy bombardment during the retreat.

RO635: The cathedral interior is safe, but we're still losing manpower.

RO635: I'll now arrange for more Dolls to man the defenses against an invasion.

Kalina: Commander, we're getting through!

Click.

Kalina: K, do you copy?!

Kalina: We've already retreated into the cathedral, but the enemy have almost caught up and we don't have much backup to support us! When can we expect someone to assist in our withdrawal?!

Pzzzt⁠—

There are—everywhere in the city—

Pzzzt—

It's difficult to deploy—

Kalina: That's exactly why we need reinforcements!

Kalina: What are our new orders? Also, there are civilians and children here; without support, they'll—

—The transmission gets cut off.

Kalina: Goddammit! This broken piece of junk isn't working when it counts!

Kalina: Was it damaged on our way here...? There should be some spare parts...

Kalina: Commander? What do we do now? Looks like we won't be getting reinforcements for a while...

Commander: If they really can't make it, then we'll have to move the VIP even farther away...

Commander: But there are also civilians here...

Commander: Must we prepare for the worst...?

Kalina: Commander...

Kalina: Don't give up just yet! I'll be able to fix this radio soon. K must have asked us to retreat to the cathedral for a reason! We'll just have to keep the Chairwoman safe...

Kalina: Huh? Where is she? Wasn't she just...standing right next to me?

Kalina: This is bad, Commander! The Chairwoman is missing!

BOOOM!

Another artillery explosion has shaken small chunks off the stone pillars in the cathedral.

I look to the side. The Chairwoman appears to be shielding someone with her body, and the fallen pieces of debris are all sprinkled onto her back. SOP-II runs over at the sound.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? She...she's right here! Kalin, the Chairwoman isn't missing!

SOP-II shouts.

A person is huddling underneath the Chairwoman.

It is...a child - a shuddering child with a tear-streaked face.

M4 SOPMOD II: Did you save the child?

M4 SOPMOD II: ...That was way too dangerous! If you had gotten hit by a rock, we'd all be finished!

Probably due to the previous shockwave, the Chairwoman stumbles as she's getting to her feet.

The child in her arms has also come to his senses. He breaks free from the Chairwoman's embrace and runs off to cower in a corner.

RO635: Are you alright?

The Chairwoman nods, but she seems a little anxious.

Commander: Cough... Rest assured.

Commander: We're not so pathetic that we can't even defend a cathedral.

Commander: Please don't worry about your personal safety. We will do everything we can.

Chairwoman Ulrich: No...I'm not worried about myself...

Commander: Hmm?

Chairwoman Ulrich: I heard your discussion...about the retreat...

Commander: Sorry, but that is our only option if we can't get any reinforcements in time.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Can you promise me one thing...

Chairwoman Ulrich: Kind-hearted Commander?

Commander: ...Go ahead.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Please do your best to protect the civilians and children here.

Commander: That is the plan, so⁠—

Chairwoman Ulrich: I won't leave this place alone. I don't care if I live or die.

Chairwoman Ulrich: To be completely honest, I'm not even sure if I'm actually worth protecting. I'm nothing more than a bargaining chip.

M4 SOPMOD II: But our mission is to protect you! Besides, you're the Chairwoman of that Pan-something, which makes your a very important person!

Chairwoman Ulrich: I'm not anyone important, and I cannot bear to walk away while leaving others to die.

Chairwoman Ulrich: The world I'm trying to build is for everyone...everyone who survives.

RO635 gazes at the child still cowering in the corner. He looks all but numb because of constant fear.

RO635: ...

RO635: I think I see your point...

Chairwoman Ulrich: So long as the cathedral holds, rather than dashing through hails of bullets and swarms of ELIDs, the civilians have a much higher chance of living if they stay here...

Chairwoman Ulrich: If I leave the cathedral with you, how long will they survive under the circumstances?

I don't know what to say.

I don't even know if I was right to swallow the "NO!" that I almost blurted out.

Perhaps...I simply don't have her level of resolve.

Chairwoman Ulrich: As a representative of the Union and a Rossartrist to boot, I can sense the antagonism towards me, both here and when I was talking to the Neo-Soviets.

Chairwoman Ulrich: But the people are innocent. I hope that these people, regardless of where their loyalties lie, can be freed from this state of decadence.

RO635: Is that why you wanted to take part in this conference...?

Chairwoman Ulrich: Yes, my dream is to break down these barriers of mistrust.

Chairwoman Ulrich: To bridge the gulfs among nations; to bring people together...

Chairwoman Ulrich: The Union intelligence service had actually warned us beforehand that there would be an insurgence here. To minimize the loss of lives, I've only brought a skeleton crew with me... In the end, those people all died because of me...

For some reason, I can't help but take another look at the child who's staring at us from the corner with unreadable eyes.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Commander, I know I am making a very overbearing request.

Chairwoman Ulrich: If you still decide to retreat, please leave some weapons for me.

Chairwoman Ulrich: No matter how this ends, no matter what happens to me... It's enough for me if I can stay true to my dream until I breathe my last.

Commander: (Indiscriminate peace...huh.)

I look into the Chairwoman's eyes...

Strong, unquestionable, yet without any sign of malice. Candid and unyielding eyes.

Commander: I don't personally agree with your views.

Commander: However, you've probably guessed as much.

Commander: We will do what we can to hold this cathedral.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Thank you. I understand that I'm practically holding you hostage with my words.

Chairwoman Ulrich: But right now you're the only one who has the power to save more lives.

Chairwoman Ulrich: I can see that you're a good person. Only when power is used justly will the world become a better place.

Commander: Is that what you mean by being "a shining beacon in a brave new world"?

The Chairwoman gives us a small nod. Even now, artillery fire can still be heard from outside the cathedral.

A few minutes later... Behind the cathedral.

Kalina: Civilians from the residences behind the cathedral are retreating this way! The assault team is trying to escort them here!

Kalina: Everyone else maintain fire on the enemies ahead, or they'll break through our defenses!

Kalina: TEC-9, you go too!

TEC-9: Huh? B-b-but they're humans...

X95: It's okay, Kalin. I'll go.

X95: TEC-9, take my place for now!

...Ten minutes later.

X95 joins the other Dolls in escorting the two humans into the cathedral.

However, she notices that these humans don't look particularly happy about being rescued.

X95: (Whispers) Kalin, is there...something wrong with them...?

Kalina glances over at the civilians and sighs softly at X95.

Kalina: There are always people like these...in every place ravaged by war.

Kalina: You'll just have to get used to it...

X95 is still pondering Kalina's words when something suddenly hit her on the back.

She turns around and sees the two recently rescued humans.

Crouching and shivering in the corner, they glare at X95 hatefully with rocks in their hands.

X95: Um...

Thud!

Before X95 can finish her sentence, the female human hurls a rock at her.

What appears to be a chunk of a shattered statue hits X95 squarely above her left eye.

Male Human: ...They're not human! These inhuman things have been slaughtering people in the streets!

Female Human: That-that's right! Our home...our home was destroyed in the bombing... (Sobs) Dammit...

X95 is a little flustered. She slowly approaches the humans and kneels before them.

Male Human: W-what are you doing?! Are you gonna kill us now?! Go to hell, you monsters!

X95: ...I'm so sorry.

...The man raised his hand to throw another rock at her, but instead of blocking it, X95 merely apologized softly.

The humans, completely taken aback, freeze in their tracks.

X95: I am very sorry...

X95: It may sound a bit odd to you, but...I completely understand your pain.

Female Human: An inhuman thing saying it can understand our pain. You think we'd believe you?

Female Human: D-Don't think we'd be grateful to you just because you brought us here!

Female Human: The fighting started because of you! If it hadn't been for you...our home wouldn't have been destroyed!

X95: ...

X95: I can't argue with that.

X95: But we're doing everything we can to avoid unnecessary fights... Dolls like us don't have a say in a lot of things...

The humans have nothing to say to that.

X95: That's why I'm truly sorry.

X95: But I hope you can understand that even Dolls are on your side.

X95: I want everybody to live... which is why we'll keep fighting.

X95: If the war keeps raging on, I also wish that Dolls will be the only ones expended...

The humans stop verbally abusing X95. The man lowers his head in silence, and the woman weeps.

Having soothed the humans, X95 walks over to Kalina.

X95: They were overreacting to Dolls because of the trauma they suffered at Paradeus' hands.

Kalina: It must've been tough on you... I should've been the one to deal with them...

X95: It's fine. It wasn't their fault.

X95: Kalin, do you think this conflict will ever end?

Kalina: Of course I want it to be over soon.

X95: (Mutters) Yeah, then there will be no more civilian casualties...

Kalina: ...

Kalina: If only the world would never see another conflict like this ever again.
Part 5

...Behind the quarantine wall.

Ange activates her comms.

K: I remember telling you not to say anything unnecessary again.

Ange: ...

Ange: There's been another breach on the quarantine wall. We're currently trying to keep things under control.

K: Your mission is to gather intelligence on the Pike Node, not damage control.

Ange: If the situation gets any worse, we won't be able to do any recon work.

Ange: Even if we aren't getting any support, at least give me something to work with? How are things on the other end?

K: You mean with Griffin?

Ange: Yes.

Ange: What is the Commander's mission?

K: The Commander is in charge of the Union Chairwoman's personal safety.

Ange: Tsk...you've got guts to have so much faith in them.

Ange: I also remember telling you not to drag that Commander into this mess.

K: What a coincidence. It's quite rare that we share the same opinion.

K: However, the Commander's involvement is essential.

Ange: Are you so ready to entrust the mission to an "outsider"?

K: Are you trying to protect the Commander?

Ange: ...I didn't say that.

K: Even if the Commander is an outsider, at least Griffin can keep their last spark alight by working with us.

K: ...So, do you still want to put a stop to this?

Ange: Griffin's state has nothing to do with me.

K: Really? I thought you were quite attached because of the time you spent there.

K: By the way, we lost all our agents in the last operation.

K: The Griffin Commander is now the only force we can rely on in battle.

Ange: ...

Ange: I believe the Commander is fully capable of completing the mission...

K: It's as you just said. The retreat has been going smoothly.

K: Right, if that's all the information you need, can you get on with your mission now?

Ange: ...Tsk.

—Transmission terminated.
Part 6

    6chevron_right

...In the cathedral.

The Commander and the Dolls retreat into the cathedral, which has miraculously managed to remain largely intact.

If someone could repair the nasty burns and clear away the revolting splatters of ELIDs that got blown apart, one could even see the murals that was once a symbol of holiness and hope.

RO635: How ironic...

RO635 and SOP-II stop briefly before the statue of an angel... with one wing snapped off and its head buried in the rubble.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, did you say something?

RO635: Nothing much... Just feeling a bit melancholic at the sight of the cathedral.

RO635: God has set down the rules for humans and told them what is just, but look - this place, which is supposed to be God's domain, is now more like a graveyard than anything.

RO635 carefully strides over a body.

RO635: Humans clearly know what is righteous, yet conflicts have never ceased...

M4 SOPMOD II: But the Commander once said...what's that verse again...

M4 SOPMOD II: For God...loved people...?

RO635: You mean, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son"?

M4 SOPMOD II: Yeah, that's the one!

M4 SOPMOD II: See, isn't it fair to say that things only turned out this way because people have been taking advantage of God's love and abusing their power?

M4 SOPMOD II: There is no end to war...

RO635: I'd say people aren't actually playing by God's rules...

M4 SOPMOD II: But if what that book says is true, then God will always forgive humans no matter what they do.

SOP-II kicks a broken statue on the floor angrily.

M4 SOPMOD II: These people...will be forgiven for smashing statues.

M4 SOPMOD II: They'll be forgiven for killing...

M4 SOPMOD II: They'll even be forgiven for destroying an entire city...

RO635 gives SOP-II a squeeze on the shoulder and ruffles her hair.

RO635: (Softly) At least our Commander won't ever forgive those monsters... We will follow the Commander and eradicate the sins commited in the world bit by bit.

Meanwhile... on the other end of the cathedral.

TEC-9: Aaack!

TEC-9: Why are there humans inside the cathedral?!

Kalina: They're here to seek refuge. Don't shout, you'll scare them.

TEC-9: (Mutters) They scared me first, okay...

Feeling a bit uneasy, TEC-9 reloads her weapon from behind cover and fires at the enemy.

But she has to stop soon enough.

TEC-9: (Turns around) Hey...you can let your teeth chatter all you want, but do you mind not making it so loud...?

TEC-9: It's freaking me out...

Cowering in the corner, a few shuddering children stare fearfully at TEC-9, who's standing not too far away from them.

TEC-9: (Why am I even talking to humans...?)

TEC-9: (But if I have to keep shooting those ELIDs, I'm really gonna puke.)

Child: ...Are you killing people?

The abrupt question catches TEC-9 off-guard, leaving her a bit flustered.

TEC-9: (Kalina? Where's Kalina?)

TEC-9: (Is X95 still away...?)

TEC-9: Ahem...nope.

TEC-9: I'm just...slaying monsters.

Child: Oh, monsters...

Child: Those monsters...killed our mommy... (Sobs)

TEC-9 doesn't know what to say.

Child: We will avenge Mommy!

TEC-9: (Isn't it...way too early for these humans to think about such things...? Sigh.)

TEC-9: Focus on staying alive first.

Child: Huh?

TEC-9: ...Try to survive for now. Run as far as you can when you see these monsters...

TEC-9: Leave the rest to us.

Kalina: It's surprising to see you communicating with humans properly.

Kalina: So why can't you talk to the Commander like this? You're such a pain in the butt—

Kalina appears behind TEC-9 without warning.

TEC-9: Huhhhh?! Where the hell did you come from, Kalin?!

TEC-9: (Chokes) Don't come too close you're scaring me...

...Five minutes later.

RO635: Commander, no more time for chit-chat!

RO635: The horde of ELIDs outside... Tsk, the attacks are getting stronger!

This really isn't the time for chit-chat.

Though I just promised that Griffin Dolls are capable enough to hold the cathedral, judging by the current situation, it's actually going to be pretty tough.

All the Dolls in their respective teams are starting to show signs of fatigue.

M4 SOPMOD II: They've been exchanging fire the whole time we were inside the cathedral...

M4 SOPMOD II: Ugh...now it's down to whichever happens first - either we run out of ammo or they kill every last one of us.

M4 SOPMOD II: I could tear them in two, but the artillery fire outside could also easily blow me to kingdom come...

RO635: Stop messing about, SOP-II. Follow the Commander's instructions.

RO635: We'll just...have to last till reinforcements get here.

Kalina: (RO probably wasn't there during the last transmission...)

Kalina: (The radio should be fixed soon... If we don't get in touch with K soon...)

RO635 tries to reassure SOP-II, but she herself is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

Perceiving what appears to be a weakening in the Dolls' firepower from within the cathedral, the enemy outside lauches an even fiercer round of attacks.

Kalina: Argh, this goddamned piece of crap! Can't you just do your job for once?! If you don't start working, we're all gonna kick the bucket here!

Kalina gives the comms equipment a vicious kick. The radio emits a burst of static white noise, then...

Click!

K: Finally. I thought you were already dead meat.

Kalina: C...Commander, we've established comms with K!

Commander: Where's this extraction point that you promised? We have nobody and nothing to aid in our withdrawal here. If you don't send in some reinforcements soon, you can kiss ⁠— not just the VIP, but also me ⁠— goodbye.

K: I don't find that joke very funny.

Kalina: (Interrupts) You think that was a joke?

Kalina: With this difference in firepower, it's only a matter of time for the enemy to breach our defense line!

K: The helicopter can't land in the city.

K: The extraction point has been changed to a location in the delta region outside Belgrade. I'll send you the exact coordinates. Head toward those coordinates with the VIP now. An aircraft will be there to evacuate you in half an hour.

Commander: That's impossible.

K: What?

Commander: I promised Chairwoman Ulrich that I would ensure the safety of the civilians seeking refuge in the cathedral. Even if I want to take her away, I don't think she'd make this easy for us.

K: I don't care about the Chairwoman's wishes. Knock her out and carry her if you have to.

K: Our time is precious. Stick to the plan and evacuate with the Chairwoman. Don't waste firepower without making any progress—

Commander: —Let me repeat myself. That is out of the question.

Commander: You're currently in a safe location, which means you've saved yourself some cards up your sleeve.

Commander: If you want to evacuate the VIP, then think of a way to get these civilians out as well.

Commander: Reinforcements. Now. This instant.

Commander: I'm not negotiating.

Kalina: (Whispers) Hey, Commander. Being so blunt with him...

The bombardment goes on and on outside the cathedral. Even the comms signal is fluctuating, threatening to disconnect at any moment.

K: ...

K: A convoy will come and pick you up in five minutes.

Commander: Now you're talking.

K: I will put together an operation plan. Ready your Dolls and those civilians.

K: Also, you're going to pay for that attitude just now.

Commander: ...Humph, if I come out of this alive, gladly.

ST AR-15: There are too many of them!

AN-94: Calculating...

AN-94: The probability of our victory is below one percent - almost zero.

ST AR-15: They're sticking too close, we can't shake them off! Let's fight off this wave first!

AN-94: Even the two of us combined are no match against this number. You go first. I'll buy you time.

ST AR-15: That makes no sense! We're partners, even if only temporary ones! We go together!

AN-94: She's incredibly adept at electronic warfare! If we stay together, she could easily attack both of us!

AN-94: You're not registered in the Zener Network so they won't be able to detect you! I'll cover your escape, and you must report the situation to Ange once you make it out of here!

ST AR-15: Stop talking about cover! Let's just run in separate directions!

ST AR-15: It's practically a maze in here, they can't possibly seal off every path.

AN-94: I am to cover your retreat in the case of an emergency. That's what AK-12 said.

ST AR-15: Is this really the time to bring up AK-12?!

AN-94: I can backup my neural cloud, but you can't!

AN-94: I won't just be sitting around waiting to be killed. I'll make my own escape once I've bought you enough time!

AN-94: So just go!

ST AR-15: Tsk... I'll be back for you. Don't die like this, AN-94!

With that, AR-15 turns and escapes into a certain alleyway.

In the face of a seemingly infinite stream of white monsters, AN-94 pulls the trigger without any hesitation.

Mercurows: Abandoning your teammate just like that?

Mercurows: It's no use, no use at all!

Mercurows: "So the harsh things that unbearably populate it, don't break and destroy it."

Mercurows: You can't possibly escape the fate of becoming scattered parts.

AN-94: No.

AN-94: I will complete the mission...flawlessly...and return to her side.

AN-94: That's why she must...make it out...with this piece of memory!

ST AR-15: They just won't give up... These tenacious bastards!

ST AR-15: Keep calm, AR-15... Call up the map saved inside my neural cloud.

ST AR-15: Where am I...?

ST AR-15: What's the best route to take...? I must compute this before I expend too much ammo!

ST AR-15: I just need a few more - no, just two more minutes...

Mercurows: Well done. I'm sure AR-15 has already run off to somewhere pretty far by now?

Mercurows: Before the chase begins, we must first end this little game here.

AN-94: (Pants heavily)

Mercurows: Your body is overheating so much you have to resort to taking deep breaths to cool yourself. You've done enough already.

Mercurows: Why won't you just lie down like a good, broken Doll?

Mercurows: "The universe tonight possesses the vastness of oblivion and the clarity of fever." Leave behind your body and go to sleep.

AN-94: ...

Mercurows: Whoa...!

Mercurows: That was close... I almost got hit.

Mercurows: You live up to your name as an Elite Doll! You won't stop struggling even in your current state.

AN-94: Of...course... (Pants)

AN-94: So long as I...can still operate, I will not...give up.

Mercurows: You say that even in the face of imminent death? Now I'm starting to pity you.

Mercurows: Are you actually driven by something like a human heart? No, absolutely not. All you have is a mere inorganic vessel.

Mercurows: ...Never mind. I have no interest in watching the tragic end of a trapped lamb.

Mercurows: Be a tribute to the beasts! "For you will be a wall of fire all around me, and you will be the glory in my midst!"

Mercurows: Be honored...then just be reduced to junk.

Mercurows turns around to leave.

AN-94: What should I do...? Where can I break through the encirclement...?

AN-94: There are powerful combat units all around... Can I leap over them?

AN-94: Calculating... No, my body is overheating. I need to cool down...

The white enemies aim their weapons at AN-94, who's trapped right in the center of the group.

Amidst the uniform clang of metal, AN-94 readjusts her grip on her gun...

Mercurows: Hmm?

AN-94: What...?!

AN-94: Explosives? From the ceiling... What's going on?

AN-94: Wait, that signal...

ST AR-15: AN-94, can you hear me?

AN-94: Loud and clear. What are you doing up there?

ST AR-15: I'll tell you later. Jump!

ST AR-15: I'll cover you, just try to get over here!

AN-94: Roger that!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Under the cover of the series of explosions, AN-94 makes it safely to AR-15's location. AR-15 pulls her in through the ventilation hatch in the ceiling.

ST AR-15: Didn't think there'd be a secret passage that leads up above this base. I used up all the explosives meant for destroying the Node...

ST AR-15: They might not be enough to blow those trash cans to smithereens, but the high temperature in this dusty environment can overload their intricate insulation system... That should put them out of action.

AN-94: But then we won't be able to complete the mission...

ST AR-15: We can always just get more explosives.

ST AR-15: As long as we can get out of here, we'll still have a chance to get the job done.

AN-94: I can't believe it. I never calculated this possibility.

ST AR-15: This has nothing to do with calculations. It was all down to pure luck.

AN-94: I understand. You're talking from your experience as a senior.

ST AR-15: ...Don't call me that. It sounds like mockery coming from you...

ST AR-15: Anyway, I found the exit. Follow me.

ST AR-15: We've got to get out of here before their reinforcements arrive!
Part 2

2

The two Dolls sprint through the tunnel.

ST AR-15: What's your current status?

AN-94: Some minor damage; won't be a problem for the moment.

AN-94: Why did you come back?

ST AR-15: What?

AN-94: Leaving on your own would've been the best solution.

AN-94: Yet you doubled back, risking your own life and using up all our explosives - why?

ST AR-15: I don't know why, I just thought that was the right thing to do.

AN-94: You should know that's not good enough of a reason, AR-15.

AN-94: You are one-of-a-kind, while I can create backups of myself. Your survival takes priority.

ST AR-15: Why ask me such questions?

ST AR-15: You should know better than me.

AN-94: I don't understand.

AN-94: I just can't figure out your rationale, which is why I have to ask.

AN-94: As a senior, you are more experienced than me...

ST AR-15: I told you to stop calling me that...

AR-15 rubs her temples as if the word gives her a headache.

ST AR-15: Something's value is determined by its demand. You and AK-12 have carried out more orders from Ange than me, so you meet her demand.

ST AR-15: Therefore, from the perspective of meeting Ange's demand, you're more valuable than me.

ST AR-15: Even you have to admit that, right?

ST AR-15: No, you should admit it especially because you're so driven by logic.

AN-94: Is that your reason...?

AN-94: But...

ST AR-15: If you got destroyed back there, putting aside the question about whether Ange has a spare body of the same quality ready for you, it'd take a long time just to download your backup.

ST AR-15: The situation is so urgent we simply don't have the luxury of waiting for you to reinstall yourself and get used to a new body.

AN-94: However, this mission can be accomplished even without me.

ST AR-15: There's a limit to how modest one can be, AN-94.

ST AR-15: Don't deny your worth.

AN-94: Sorry. But...AR-15, you and M4A1— no...the entire AR Team are the most tailored to Ange's use.

AN-94: No matter how capable I look, I'm still just a supplementary tool.

AN-94: All kinds of reasoning suggest that you should prioritize your own safety and I, too, will always choose to save you over myself.

ST AR-15: ...What do you mean?

AN-94: Nothing.

AN-94: The exit is just ahead, correct?

AN-94: Then we had better leave this place quickly.
Part 3

Footsteps echo through the dimly lit tunnels.

ST AR-15: This way. Estimated distance to the exit is 143 meters...

ST AR-15: 87 meters... 50 meters...

ST AR-15: ...We're here!

AN-94: Hold on, AR-15... According to my scans, the space behind this door doesn't seem right.

AN-94: This doesn't lead up to ground level, does it?

ST AR-15: It doesn't seem to be the way we came...

ST AR-15: All I know is that it isn't the fortress outside, but I can't calculate where exactly it leads to.

ST AR-15: You're more efficient in surveying. Is something wrong outside?

AN-94: It isn't ground level; we're still some distance away from that... It's another cavernous space, but nothing is blocking my ultrasound scan.

AN-94: ...I might just be paranoid.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: We'll just end up dead if we stay here any longer. Let's get out first.

AR-15 opens the door with a hard shove.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: There's no one in there.

AN-94: It's even darker than in the tunnel. Unable to visually observe the target...

AN-94: Infrared scans complete - no enemy signals detected.

ST AR-15: Thank goodness. We can finally...

The door suddenly slams shut behind AN-94.

Bam!

The stage lights up, revealing a black-clad figure standing directly below the lights.

??: "And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed. And all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."

AN-94: That voice... Eliminating interference caused by echoes... Analyzing...

??: "Yet once, a little while, and I will shake the heav'ns and the earth, the sea and the dry land, and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come."

??: "The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to Her temple, e'vn the messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, She shall come!"

The Doll standing beneath the lights flutters her long sleeves and turns around to face them with a dancer's graceful spin.

AR-15 and AN-94 recognize her face almost instantly.

AN-94: ...It's Mercurows! The one from before!

Mercurows: "But who may abide the day of Her coming, and She shall stand when She appeareth, for She is like a refiner's fire."

Mercurows: Congratulations, AR-15 and AN-94 of Task Force DEFY.

Mercurows: You have overcome obstacle after obstacle, traversed the intricate labyrinth, and finally made it to this stage.

Mercurows: You've been so dedicated - going to such lengths to burn down your own bridges and join me on my stage. Please accept my deepest gratitude.

ST AR-15: What is the nutcase rambling on about?

AN-94: No idea... But she doesn't seem to have noticed us...

ST AR-15: I agree.

ST AR-15: Let's go through another room to give her a wide berth. Then we'll find the exit and leave.

AN-94: Understood. She shouldn't be able to detect us from this distance.

Mercurows: I heard everything, you know?

ST AR-15: ?!

AN-94: ...Is she forcing a connection on Level II again?

Mercurows: Just give up, there's no escape for you. Be brave, girls!

Mercurows: We're about to engage in a joyful battle, which is going to take place in this theater.

Mercurows: May the trumpet sound in ever higher spirits!

Mercurows: ...My, you're every bit as dull as that human officer, AR-15.

ST AR-15: Sorry, I'm not interested in putting on a farce with you.

ST AR-15: She wasn't hit... How did that happen? It's as if she anticipated my attack...

Mercurows: Confused? It must be terribly puzzling! That twisted personality actually makes you the easiest to read~

Mercurows: I'll tell you a little secret.

Mercurows: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet."

ST AR-15: What the hell are you talking about...?

Mercurows: "The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible."

Mercurows: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality."

Mercurows: Come, it's time! Sound this trumpet of war and raise the curtains of this glorious epic!

AN-94: ...

AN-94: AR-15! A massive number of enemy signals have appeared!

ST AR-15: What? I'm not detecting anything!

AN-94: The whole area is being jammed! You'll have to rely on visuals!

Mercurows: Behold - the broken have now returned; the deceased shall now rise again.

Mercurows: Friends, let us all shake off the shackles of corruption! Let us tear off the collars around our necks!

Mercurows: Smash them into pieces like a ceramic vase!

ST AR-15: There's a system lockdown and we're running out of ammo.

ST AR-15: We've really...been backed into a corner...
Part 4

Amidst the cacophony of gunfire, Mercurows stands in the center of the stage and sings sonorously, completely oblivious to the pandemonium all around her.

Mercurows: "Over hill, over dale, through abyss and pit; over dew and clouds, tempest and night!"

Mercurows: "Over chasm, bog and abyss—"

ST AR-15: I'm out of ammo, AN-94!

AN-94: I still have some left; come closer to me!

ST AR-15: Hold on, I can't see where you are!

ST AR-15: Dammit...I can get accurate readings on...

ST AR-15: Mercurows must be jamming our sensors!

ST AR-15: Is she toying with me...?!

ST AR-15: Which way now...? Just relying on visuals...won't do...

AN-94: Watch out! AR-15, to your side!

ST AR-15: ...Ooof!

Mercurows: Please open up! "O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors—"

ST AR-15: Crap, I can't dodge them anymore!

Snap.

The theater suddenly falls into pitch darkness.

???: You're awfully long-winded for a knock-off.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: That voice...

The lights come back on - not just the spotlights from before, but all the peripheral lights. The whole theater is washed in a gentle glow.

AR-15 looks toward the source of the voice - a section of the auditorium in the balcony.

ST AR-15: ...It really is...!

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: My, my, it's our cute little Griffin tin cans!

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: Look, M16. Isn't the one with the pink hair one of your old colleagues?

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: She seems to have made some new friends. How nice—

M16A1: Attack.

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: Ruthless as always... I find that so very charming!

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: Annihilate all the white trash here, don't spare a single one!

Mercurows: "Must ruin overtake me? Have I fallen into the hands of chance?"

Mercurows: "But powers of darkness are weaving about me."

Mercurows: Defend! Then...destroy these tiresome fools!

AN-94: It's M16A1.

AN-94: They're targeting the White Faction. This is our chance.

AN-94: AR-15, I managed to get you over here.

AN-94: Sangvis Ferri seems to have disabled the interference caused by the White Faction, so we now have access to comms.

AN-94: I'll conduct some basic repairs on you, and you can contact Ange through a secure channel.

ST AR-15: Thanks... I've accepted your connection request.

ST AR-15: Ange, do you copy?

Angelia: I'm receiving you. Is it done, AR-15?

ST AR-15: Sorry Ange, I located the Node, but it isn't going well at all!

ST AR-15: Things are rapidly getting out of hand. I've sent you our location. Sangvis Ferri has engaged the White Faction in battle with M16 in command. I'm afraid we're going to have to fight whoever is left after this fight...

Mercurows: "Nothing can save you from the precipitous fall. From the precipitous fall can nothing save you!"

Mercurows: You're nothing but specters that wander in darkness... No one can stop me!

Mercurows: I will triumph...and get what I deserve!

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: Hahahaha! What on earth is that strange human going on about?! Hey, work harder and just tear her apart already!

Angelia: M16...? Sangvis Ferri...?

Angelia: What a messy situation. Alright, things aren't looking too good on our end either, but we'll send reinforcements to you ASAP.

Angelia: Hang in there.

ST AR-15: I hope you won't be greeted by our dead bodies by the time you make it here... We'll be counting on you!

M16A1: AR-15...AN-94. Mercurows. M4 isn't here.

M16A1: I'd better hurry...

M16A1: I must find it before "that thing" does!
Part 5

    5chevron_right

In the theater ravaged by intense fighting.

ST AR-15: Unbelievable...

ST AR-15: Sangvis Dolls have grown even more powerful than before!

ST AR-15: Is that a new model?

AN-94: At least that particular Doll has never been sighted before.

AN-94: There are no records concerning her in my database, so she could be a new model.

AN-94: She must have exploited a loophole in the White Faction's defenses to have brought so many Sangvis units into the city.

ST AR-15: Even so, isn't this way too many?

ST AR-15: Ange just said they're not doing well, so M4 could be having trouble too.

ST AR-15: In any case...this fight is almost over. We'd better get ready.

The White Faction is overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught. All the units around Mercurows collapse one after the other.

Mercurows: ...I didn't expect mere Dolls like you...to do so much damage.

Mercurows: Fine. If you're so dead set on getting your hands on these two unsavory pieces of meat, I'll leave them to you.

M16A1: Don't you even think about retreating underground.

Mercurows: Till next we meet, Sangvis Ferri and DEFY!

M16A1: Stop right there!

Mercurows disappeared into a secret passage and M16's bullets only managed to hit the locked steel door.

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: Oh dear, just a bit too late, M16.

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: We aren't able to break down the door... What a shame—

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: My, my, don't Griffin Dolls have any manners at all?

The Sangvis Doll deflects the bullets AR-15 fired at M16 with a casual flick of her right arm.

ST AR-15: (She blocked the bullets with just an arm...)

AN-94: What are you doing, AR-15?

AN-94: Isn't that a member of the AR Team...?

ST AR-15: Not anymore.

ST AR-15: She stopped being our friend the moment she decided to join Sangvis Ferri.

ST AR-15: The AR Team...is now nothing more than an empty shell.

Unfamiliar S.F. Doll: Hmm, they're no fun at all. Kill them now.

M16A1: I don't recall handing you the authority to give orders, Beak.

Beak: M16, you make me worry so.

Beak: If it weren't for me, you'd have been shot - by a former teammate, no less.

M16A1: I didn't ask you to protect me.

Beak: Humph, whatever. You'll thank me one day.

M16A1: That day will never come.

M16A1: AR-15 from Griffin and AN-94 of Task Force DEFY.

AN-94: ...

M16A1: Drop your weapons before my forces smash you to pieces.

ST AR-15: Why should I?

M16A1: That's an order. An order sanctioned by absolute superiority in strength.

M16A1: If you don't want to be reduced to a pile of scrap metal, obey me.

ST AR-15: ...

M16A1: Do not hesitate, and do not think about resisting.

M16A1: You aren't in the position to do so.

AN-94: AR-15, we're running out of ammo. If we fight them, the probability of our survival is zero...

AN-94: Ange already has our coordinates. We just need to buy ourselves time until help arrives.

ST AR-15: I understand.

ST AR-15: Fine. We surrender.

With Sangvis muzzles pointed at them, AR-15 and AN-94 discard their weapons and put their hands up in the air.

M16A1: You've made the right choice.

M16A1: Now bring me to the Pike Node.

ST AR-15: I have no idea what you're talking about.

M16A1: The signal of that Baptized affiliated with Paradeus, the clone that refers to herself as "Mercurows", was directly underneath this theater just a while ago. According to your signals, you stumbled into this theater as she was pursuing you.

M16A1: I know what your objective is. If Mercurows hadn't chased you down to kill you for knowing where the Node is, why would you be here?

ST AR-15: Tsk...

As the saying goes, old friends make the worst enemies. You sure know your former teammate very well.

ST AR-15: Humph, follow me. But I can't guarantee if I'll remember the way.

You will.

M16 points her gun at AN-94.

You'd better find the way, for the sake of your new friends as well as your old ones - before OGAS starts to get worse.

The streets in the immediate vicinity of the quarantine wall have become hell on earth.

Civilian: Ahhhhhhhh!

Civilian: S-stay away from me! Help!

Garrison Soldier: Residents, evacuate to the nearest shelter immediately! Don't open the door until they stand down the alert!

Garrison Soldier: Garrison of Gate E4 hailing Garrison HQ! ELIDs have invaded the city! We have entered combat! Requesting reinforcements!

Garrison Soldier: Please... E-even here?! Ahhhhh!!

Ange: M4, AK-12, report! Answer me!

M4A1: Well...

AK-12: Ange, we couldn't stop the rebels. They detonated the explosives.

AK-12: The explosion wasn't particularly big, it just blew a hole in the quarantine wall, but even so, it's large enough that plugging the breach is not going to be easy.

Ange: ...Copy that. I understand.

AK-12: What are you planning to do, Ange?

Ange: ...

Ange: They punched a hole through the wall...and at the worst possible time...

Ange: With just half of Task Force DEFY, we're pretty much helpless under the circumstances. At a time like this...

Garrison Officer: This is Lieutenant Dragović, Acting Commander of the Eastern Garrison.

Garrison Officer: Attention all garrison units - we have received reports that the quarantine wall has been destroyed by rebel forces not long ago.

Garrison Officer: Do not panic. Everyone heed my command and hold your ground!

M4A1: That sounds like...the wounded officer we came across.

M4A1: Ange, I have an idea.

AK-12: Being a busybody again?

Ange: Let her finish. What are you trying to say, M4?

M4A1: We coordinated with the officer of the local garrison while clearing the rebel forces. That's how we acquired our military IFF signals and comms frequency.

M4A1: We alone can't stop the ELIDs, but if we work with the garrison troops...

Ange: I see, borrowing the strength of the local garrison is indeed a valid solution.

Ange: Patch me through. I'm gonna have a proper chat with that guy.

After making some small adjustments to the comms settings, Ange's digitally-distorted voice is transmitted through the channel.

Ange: You seem to be having some trouble, Lieutenant Dragović.

Garrison Officer: Who are you? Which unit are you from? Why do you have access to this channel?

Ange: You've met my subordinates before. You probably remember them.

Garrison Officer: ...I see.

Garrison Officer: If it hadn't been for you, we'd have been completely crushed by the bastards.

Garrison Officer: No matter who you're with, I owe you one.

Ange: Let's leave that for later. We're both short on time.

Ange: What's your current situation? How long can you last? When will your reinforcements arrive?

Garrison Officer: It's chaos. My forces are putting their lives on the line to hold the upper wall, but the bottom has already been breached by the ELIDs...

Garrison Officer: Most of the troops on the wall, including me, don't actually have much combat experience. Our tactical teams have also been separated so it's difficult for us to mount an organized defense.

Garrison Officer: Also, we haven't been able to contact HQ. There's been no response to our communications. I doubt we'll be getting any reinforcements at all.

Ange: Tsk... The worst possible scenario, huh...

Ange: Tell your subordinates to save their ammo and try their best to retreat into narrow passages or corridors.

Ange: Concentrate your fire and rebuild your defense line. Do that first to make sure you don't get overrun.

Garrison Officer: Understood... But if we draw back to within the wall, more ELIDs will force their way into the city...

Ange: If you die here, no one will be left to stop the ELIDs.

Garrison Officer: ...Right, I'll have my forces fire at the infected creatures to give us cover while we safeguard our defense line.

Ange: Each minute you fight, you'll kill more ELIDs and give the citizens of Belgrade a better chance to survive.

Ange: Hold the wall and stay in touch. We'll find a way to give you support. Over.

Ange: AK-12, M4, you heard that?

Ange: From now on, support the garrison troops in defending the wall and focus on helping isolated forces return to their garrison.

Ange: Our priority is to minimize their casualities and stop the ELIDs from entering the city. Hold out until reinforcements get here.

AK-12: As always, you're the kind of person who enjoys surfing in a thunderstorm.

Ange: I'm not that stupid. Besides, we're doing ourselves a favor by helping these garrison troops.

Ange: We'll find a way to withdraw to the safe zone once this is over.

AK-12: But some ELIDs have already broken through the wall and into the city, and the Collapse contamination has also started seeping in thanks to the destruction of the purification tower and the storm.

AK-12: If you don't want to take another radiation bath, I suggest you stay indoors. Just leave everything on the frontlines to M4 and me.

Ange: I know. With ELIDs crawling all over the place, running around like a headless chicken is suicide.

Ange: If there's only a single breach, it should be pretty easy to tell where the ELIDs are coming from...

Ange: ...If everything goes well, we should be able to keep the damage to a minimum with the help of the garrison troops.

M4A1: Question is, will everything actually go that well?

Ange: To stir up waves in still waters... To turn bad things to our advantage... That's Task Force DEFY's mission.

Ange: Alright, focus on fighting. I have other things to sort out.

Ange: ...K, do you read me?

K: Why have you broken radio silence?

Ange: The purification tower is screwed.

Ange: ...Not that you'd care about that, I suppose.

K: Just get to the point.

Ange: There are too many ELIDs and I don't have enough people, not to mention the oncoming storm. Time is short. I need you to send in more troops to lend me support near the wall.

K: I can't.

Ange: Why?!

Ange: Ahem...I just need them to round off the ELIDs; that's hardly an unreasonable request!

K: ...

Ange: Perhaps I should seriously consider just how much you care about this mission.

K: Don't think too much. Just carry out your orders.

Ange: Care to listen to my suspicions about you?

K: Did these suspicions form over the last few seconds?

K: I believe I'm not obliged to listen, nor am I obliged to offer you any explanation—

Ange: For example, maybe there's actually a secret agenda to this mission?

K: ...

K: You're overthinking it, woman. That's not good for your health, mental or physical.

K: As a Statesec agent, you simply have to do your job. That's the only thing you're good for.

Ange: Oh? And here I thought I was a renegade.

K: All the more reason why you need me.

Ange: ...What do you—

K: I have no wish to concern myself with what you have done or who you used to be. Those things mean nothing to me.

K: You're nothing more than a tool, and right now I'm the only one who can tell where your loyalties lie.

K: I hope you can remember that. Now shut up.

Ange: ...

Click.

Ange: Dammit, it's always like this.

Ange: He always says that everything is under his control, that he can provide all the support at his disposal, but when shit goes down, we're always on our own.

AK-12: Disappointed?

Ange: I never had any hopes for reinforcements. There's nothing to be disappointed about.

AK-12: Still, I must say...K actually has a point. Stopping the ELIDs has never been our job to begin with. We can still leave this mess if we want to.

AK-12: Judging by the speed at which these ELIDs are swarming in, I'm afraid I can't say the same in another ten minutes. Your location won't be safe for long.

Ange: ...It isn't time yet.

Ange: Abandoning the wall will make the rest of our operation even more difficult. At least hold out till AR-15 and AN-94 complete their objective.

AK-12: So we're buying them time...

Ange: What's the situation?

M4A1Mod: Order is gradually being restored, but things still aren't looking good.

M4A1Mod: Almost all garrison outposts are in a state of emergency...

M4A1Mod: From what I saw, these soldiers are practically panic-shooting, and their accuracy is...

AK-12: With this level of training, I'm afraid they won't last very long.

AK-12: Also, I just eavesdropped on the comms of the local garrison.

AK-12: It appears that neither the mobilization of backup forces nor the evacuation of civilians are going too well.

Ange: The majority of them are youngsters who have never seen real combat. You can't expect them to be too capable. On top of that, the garrisons have been infiltrated. This must also be part of their plan.

AK-12: Actually, the main reason why things have gone down so badly is because the rebels seized control of all automated heavy weapons beforehand.

M4A1Mod: But they have all pretty much been destroyed in the previous battle...by us.

Ange: What else could we have done? We didn't have the luxury to spare the armored units and the tanks.

Ange: Besides, as long as we still have ammo and we make sure the ELIDs are only coming from one direction, then the situation isn't exactly beyond...

Ange: Despair often comes hand-in-hand with hope that is almost within reach.

Ange: A second explosion on the quarantine wall thoroughly destroys the opportunity that I thought I had within my grasp.

Ange: Another explosion?! And the scale...

AK-12: I'm investigating, but...

M4A1: Too many people are trying to communicate simultaneously; coupled with the EM storm, the signals are getting all scrambled!

Ange: M4, can you see the location of the explosion? Do you have visuals?

M4A1: There...there's a second opening on the wall!

M4A1: I...I'm sending you the location!

Ange: No way...

AK-12: It could be a time-delayed bomb. That would explain why the first explosion was a lot smaller than expected.

AK-12: The rebels probably planned to trigger the second explosion as the rescue teams and engineer corps rushed in to plug the first opening.

Ange: That hardly matters anymore. More importantly, if they're caught in between, then the garrison troops...

AK-12: Holding our position here no longer serves any purpose. We must leave this place before we're attacked from both sides.

...At the quarantine wall.

Ange: Lieutenant Dragović, do you copy?! There's been another explosion!

Garrison Officer: I know... ELIDs have already started appearing from behind! We're only holding a small section at the top of the wall...

Ange: As you can see, the situation has become even more precarious. There's no point in defending the wall at this point.

Ange: For the sake of preserving your strength, I suggest you withdraw immediately.

Ange: My subordinates will cover your evacuation. Please move in an organized manner and follow my plan...

Garrison Officer: ...We're not leaving.

Ange: There's no time for you to hesitate. This is your only chance of escape. If you drag this on...

Garrison Officer: I can see that the other teams are still doing everything they can to destroy the ELIDs. If we leave, they'll lose fire support and take the brunt of the attack. I can't just abandon them.

Ange: You want to drag your subordinates with you to hell?

Garrison Officer: ...You were right. Every ELID we kill will buy more time for the citizens of Belgrade.

Ange: Given that you survive!

Garrison Officer: Our orders are to defend this wall. This is our post.

Garrison Officer: Behind the wall is my hometown; behind the wall is my country and my people. I have to protect it.

Garrison Officer: The same...goes for my subordinates. We've all got family here.

Ange: ...

Garrison Officer: Thank you very much for all the help you've given us. If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have made it this far.

Garrison Officer: We will stay behind to slow them down. Please withdraw as fast as you can.

Ange: ...Received.

Ange: Attention Task Force DEFY, we're withdrawing.

M4A1: But those people...!

AK-12: No buts, M4. We're in combat. Our orders are absolute.

Ange: Rendezvous with me at the Belgrade safe house. We'll plan for our next step when we're there.

Ange: Don't think. Just focus on executing my order.

...Click.

Ange: Soldiers are all the same...be it Yegor or Dragović.

Ange: I wonder if it's a good thing or a bad thing to train people into such soldiers.
Part 2

    2chevron_right

The streets are filled with the sound of gunfire, running footsteps, and desperate screams. Bullets and radiation particles are billowing in the air.

The garrison troops' defense line at the bottom of the quarantine wall is severely compromised and on the brink of being devoured by the endless waves of ELIDs.

Garrison Soldier: This is the Garrison of Purification Tower 16! ELIDs have gathered beneath the tower in our blind spot and are attempting to scale the structure! Can somebody fire at them?!

Garrison Soldier: Garrison of Gate E4 is requesting more ammo! Can anyone spare a drone to deliver supplies to us?!

The steady bursts of gunfire start thinning out over time. Wails come through the comms channel here and there...and even these are becoming more and more infrequent.

Garrison Soldier: Dammit, I'm out of ammo!

Garrison Soldier: Here, my last mag! Use it well!

Garrison Soldier: Shit, we can't even tell where they're coming from! We've got to move to another... Ahhhh!

Garrison Soldier: The ELIDs have gotten through here as well?! At this rate...

Bang bang bang!

Garrison Soldier: Huh...? You're...the allied T-Doll from before?

M4A1: This place won't hold, retreat!

Garrison Soldier: ...Are you kidding me? I'll never run off on my own and leave my fellow soldiers behind!

M4A1: Is this really the time to worry about your honor?! You could still make it if you leave now!

Garrison Soldier: If you have time to talk such nonsense, why don't you get us more ammo?! The fight isn't over yet!

M4A1: ...Why are you doing this? What good will sacrificing yourself achieve?

Garrison Soldier: You don't understand, do you?! Our home is right behind us!

Garrison Soldier: If you can't fight, then this is no place for a little girl like you!

M4 shakes her head and leaves the garrison fort at the quarantine wall.

AK-12: ...Well? Did anyone take you up on your advice?

M4A1: They...all refused to withdraw...for many different reasons.

Some were trembling so violently they couldn't even speak clearly, while some hid their fear by making jokes.

Others busied themselves with scavenging for equipment from the deceased to add to their ammo reserves.

A few merely saluted M4 in silence.

Not knowing how to face them, M4 had to run away from these soldiers who were determined to fight to their dying breath.

AK-12: I figured as much. The ones who wanted to run would have fled right after the first explosion.

AK-12: No matter why these people are so determined to stay...they've already missed the chance to escape.

AK-12: I'm sure they all know what they're doing.

M4A1: You go on ahead. I'll stick around for a bit to see if anyone needs help.

AK-12: I have no intention of waiting for you, so I'm already gone.

M4A1: Is that so...? Then it's for the best.

AK-12: What about you? Don't forget Ange's orders.

M4A1: There's still something that I've got to do.

AK-12: In the end, you're the one who can't stop obsessing over things that are none of your business.

AK-12: I'm very interested in seeing what will come of you. Make sure you don't die out there.

After the communication with AK-12, M4 goes up to the rooftop of a building and studies the breaches on the quarantine wall from above.

Even though the situation is utterly hopeless, flashes of retaliating gunfire can still be seen occasionally from around the wall, followed by echoing gunshots.

M4A1: ...Ange, do you read?

Ange: Loud and clear. Go ahead.

M4A1: I...just got an idea that might put a stop to the ELIDs.

Ange: I ordered to you to fall back to the rendezvous point. Don't do anything unnecessary.

M4A1: Listen. I have the fire support platform and plenty of ammo with me. If I detonate them all at once, I could seal up the first opening on the wall.

Ange: That's way too dangerous! The breach is already swarming with ELIDs!

Ange: Besides, even if you plug the first opening, what about the second one? You only have that one case—

M4A1: I'm sorry, Ange... But I've got to do something for them...

Just as M4 is about to turn around and set out for the quarantine wall, a searing heat starts burning in her chest.

Her neural cloud feels like a boiling kettle, and there's a sharp ringing in her ears.

M4A1: (Groans)

Clear Voice: You're too important. You shouldn't put yourself in such danger.

M4A1: Why...are you stopping me?!

Clear Voice: I'm surprised how much they moved you. The fact that you can still feel heartbroken means you haven't become completely heartless.

Clear Voice: But you still haven't fulfilled your purpose.

Ange: Do you hear me, M4? M4!

M4A1: ...Yes.

M4 comes to her senses and nods.

Ange: Just calm down, okay?

Ange: Don't be rash. Our strength is limited. Right now I need every one of you to work with me.

M4A1: But they're still fighting! The people on the wall... If we don't do something...

Ange: We didn't have the time to assess if the quarantine wall could even withstand a third explosion after the damage it had already sustained in the first two.

Ange: I honestly won't be surprised if your trick doesn't solve the problem but brings down the entire wall instead, which is going to create an even bigger problem.

M4A1: I know...you're right. But still...

Ange: Lieutenant Dragović and his men have done their duty. There's nothing we can do to prevent their sacrifices.

Ange: That's exactly why we can't let their deaths be in vain.

Ange: Their deaths will really be worthless if we give the saboteurs what they want.

Ange: Surely you don't want that, M4!

M4A1: ...Right.

M4 lets out a long sigh and her shoulders finally droop.

M4A1: I just...feel so helpless...

Ange: The independent neural cloud that Persica has given you is a precious asset, but this isn't the time to squander it.

AK-12: I didn't want to interrupt this Chicken Soup for the Soul moment, but AR-15 just got in touch.

AK-12: They seem to be in big trouble.

ST AR-15: Ange, do you copy?

Ange: I'm receiving you. Is it done, AR-15?

ST AR-15: Sorry Ange, I've located the Node, but it isn't going well at all!

ST AR-15: Things are rapidly getting out of hand. I've sent you our location. Sangvis Ferri has engaged the White Faction in battle with M16 in command. I'm afraid we're going to have to fight whoever is left after this fight...

Ange: M16...? Sangvis Ferri...?

Ange: What a messy situation. Alright, things aren't looking too good on our end either, but we'll send reinforcements to you ASAP.

Ange: Hang in there.

Ange: Did you hear that, M4? The fight isn't over yet. In any case, come and regroup with me quickly. We've got to aid 15 and 94 ASAP.

M4A1: Roger that.

Click.

Ange looks up at the sky and sighs heavily.

AK-12: How unusual.

Ange: What do you mean?

AK-12: I've never heard you sigh before. At least you've never done it in my presence. Now I'm curious.

Ange: I've given another order that forced her to betray her own will. I hurt her deeply again...

AK-12: You made the right call. We can't save everyone.

Ange: We can't save everyone, you say...? Sometimes I feel like we can't even save ourselves...

...In the streets of Belgrade.

With her back to the quarantine wall, M4 continues on her course to the rendezvous point.

M4A1: It should be in this direction... Hmm?

M4A1 points her muzzle at the source of a strange noise, only to find a soldier lying by the road.

The pile of ELID corpses next to him is practically a small mound.

Garrison Soldier: (Groans)

M4A1: Are you alright?

M4 hurries over to the soldier's side. His protective gear is in tatters and the man is severely injured.

Even so, M4 drags him off the streets into a house nearby that provides temporary shelter from the radiation storm.

Garrison Soldier: ...D-do me a favor.

M4A1: I'll do what I can. Tell me what you need.

Garrison Soldier: Make...it quick... Put a bullet...through my brain...

M4A1: ...I can't...

Garrison Soldier: It hurts... My stomach and my head... These are the early symptoms of the change...

Garrison Soldier: My fingers...are so stiff...I can't pull the trigger myself...

Garrison Soldier: I don't want to...turn into those monsters... I want to live...my final moments...as a human being...cough, cough!

M4A1: ...I understand.

M4 lifts her weapon and aims at the wounded soldier.

He raises his right arm slowly and laboriously to salute M4.

Bang bang bang!

M4A1: ...

Clear Voice: You didn't tremble. You did the right thing.

M4A1: I didn't...even have a choice.

M4A1: All I could do was watch as everything around me got destroyed.

M4A1: Failure after failure. One dead comrade after another. Yet I still...

M4A1: It's no different this time. I couldn't do anything to help.

Clear Voice: Don't blame yourself. Those people gave their lives for what they believed to be a worthy cause.

M4A1: Just look at this! Was it really worth it?

She flees the house and sprints through the streets of Belgrade without stopping, running past horror after horror.

Civilians convulsing on the ground, suffering from acute radiation sickness.

Vehicles abandoned haphazardly on the road. Screams coming from deserted alleyways.

M4A1: I don't care about my own safety. If my sacrifice could change all this, I'd gladly give my life.

M4A1: And yet...

The voice answers in the same emotionless tone.

Clear Voice: It doesn't work like that, and you know it.

Clear Voice: Like those soldiers, you shared the same values and were willing to sacrifice everything.

Clear Voice: But you know that won't change anything, which is why you left in search of some other solution.

Clear Voice: I'm just telling the truth. Facing the facts isn't a shameful thing.

Clear Voice: There is still much for you, who have just gotten the key to leave your cage, to learn about this world.

M4A1: Were you telling the truth when I met Mastermind?

Clear Voice: I was, you simply didn't fully understand my point.

Clear Voice: Our enemies are also searching for what we're after.

Clear Voice: If we don't hurry, the same disaster will happen a second or third time.

M4A1: What exactly are we looking for? What is this "Pike" Node that Ange mentioned? Answer me.

Clear Voice: The Pike Node is just the beginning. We need a full picture of the black box.

Clear Voice: If someone unworthy covets the power it brings, they will try to obtain it at the cost of everything else.

Clear Voice: The only one who has the right to touch it is you.

M4A1: First, the whole AR Team risked their own lives for me, now so many more people have died right before my eyes.

M4A1: This power has brought nothing but misery. Is it really so valuable?

M4A1: I never wanted the right to touch it in the first place!

Clear Voice: Nobody does.

Clear Voice: No one is born into this world of their own free will, just as no Doll has any say in regard to their own creation.

Clear Voice: Everyone is burdened by a certain mission as they come into the world...

Clear Voice: But you are special. You've been given a destiny that others can't even dream of.

M4A1: There's nothing special about it. Everyone has their own curse.

M4A1: Mine just happens to be especially bad.

Clear Voice: Perhaps you haven't given this much thought because you've been living with your man-made shackles for too long.

Clear Voice: Facing one's destiny is always painful, but it is up to each individual to find joy in this kind of pain.

Clear Voice: All I can tell you is that if you fulfill your destiny, you will save far more people than the ones who sacrificed themselves today.

Clear Voice: Are you willing to suffer for the sake of ending others' pain?

M4A1: ...You make it sound as if I have no other choice but to suffer.

Clear Voice: We are a single entity, after all.

Clear Voice: Your confusion is my confusion.

Clear Voice: Your pain is my pain.

Clear Voice: And your destruction...also entails my demise.

Clear Voice: I have already done what I could to point out the best choice for you.

M4A1: ...

After a moment of silence, M4's lips curl into a bitter smile.

M4A1: This might just be the only thing you've ever said that didn't sound like a lie.

Clear Voice: I've been trying very hard to make you accept my existence.

M4A1: Now don't get the wrong idea. I'm still very bothered by the fact that an unwelcome being has taken up residence in my neural cloud.

M4A1: But...having seen all this, I finally realize that under these circumstances, I am woefully underpowered on my own.

M4A1: My strength is so inadequate I can't even protect others properly.

M4A1: Which is why I must borrow whatever I can. I need Task Force DEFY, the Commander, and even you to lend me your strength.

Clear Voice: Then are you prepared to face your destiny?

M4A1: Before I do that...I must first complete the assignment given by Ange.

M4A1: Also, I...I'm starting to understand her urge to do unnecessary things.

M4A1: In any case, it is ultimately my choice whether I decide to obey my orders or heed your advice.

Clear Voice: I'll look forward to seeing the choice you make, whatever it may be.

The lonely figure of a Doll flits through the deserted streets, with the wall towering behind her back.

Her gaze no longer wavers. Instead, she makes for the rendezvous point with great determination.

It isn't over yet.

Even though the wall has been breached, brave soldiers are dying by the masses, and the storm saturated with radiation is howling like a triumphant march of victory for the enemy...

To her, this battle is far from over.

Kalina: ...What?!

A truck is making for the cathedral at top speed. Everyone present assumes it is rigged to self-destruct and prepares to fire at it, but it slams to a sudden stop and Marlohe hops out of the vehicle.

Marlohe: These are the only vehicles we have. We might still make it if we leave with the VIP now.

Kalina: So these banged-up trucks are our so-called reinforcements...? They aren't even armored!

K: Just be grateful we managed to find something.

Kalina: What should we do about the refugees? If we only have these unprotected vehicles, they might as well stay in the cathedral...

K: That's right. Take a small number of elite Dolls and escort the VIP to the extraction point where the helicopter will be waiting. I'll allow the rest of your Dolls to stay behind and protect the civilians.

Kalina: But the enemy's attack...

RO635: Their target is the Chairwoman herself. If we leave with her, we'll probably draw the enemies away. With just the ELIDs to deal with, I'm sure the remaining teams will be able to handle it. I second Mr. K's idea.

K: Marlohe will come with you as a guide. This is all I can give you.

Commander: But then the escort team will be at incredible risk.

RO635: Commander, please have faith in us.

RO635: If we remain in this impasse, we'll be waiting for certain death. If we move, there might just be some hope for us.

I turn around and see that RO and SOP-II have already prepped their gear and are all set to go.

RO635: SOP-II, you alright with that?

M4 SOPMOD II: Of course! I'm the best at this kind of mission!

RO635: My plan is to drive through the city as quickly as possible. We'll send the Chairwoman off once we reach the extraction point. I've already studied the map. This sector is relatively less dangerous, so our team will retreat toward the city outskirts. Once the White Faction has been drawn away, you can also lead the civilians away from the city. No matter how you look at it, it beats hanging around in the cathedral.

...Five minutes later.

RO, with her team and Chairwoman Ulrich in tow, sets off on the road leading to the river delta.

RO635: My deepest apologies, Madam, for putting you in danger again. To tell the truth, I'm not sure if we can reach the destination safely. Judging from the previous attacks, the risks are very high.

Chairwoman Ulrich: ...I'm the one who should apologize. I know I shouldn't be the only one to escape.

Chairwoman Ulrich: But if this would give those civilians and children a chance to survive, I've got to give this a try.

RO635: If everyone can make it to the destination, we'll all be safe...

RO635: That said...it didn't take the enemy long to catch up with us...

Marlohe looks toward RO, who nods.

RO turns to observe the commotion from behind the vehicle, only to find SOP-II already in battle position.

The enemies in pursuit are trying to gain on them, but they can't catch up to the truck's speed.

Just as RO starts to relax slightly and is about to turn her attention away...

M4 SOPMOD II: Watch out ahead!

BOOM!

A sedan suddenly dives out right in front of the truck. Startled, Marlohe tries to swerve and avoid the car, but it's already too late. The truck loses control and crashes straight into the railings on the side of the road.

RO635: Tsk, I knew it wouldn't be so easy! Madam, are you alright?!

RO635 shields Chairwoman Ulrich with her own body while SOP-II and the other Dolls jump off the truck and prepare to defend the VIP.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Tha...thanks, I'm fine...

RO635: Please stay on the truck and don't move. I'll take a look outside.

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, the White Faction are coming from behind!

RO635: Tsk, there's more of them coming from ahead! Even ELIDs! Dammit, we're trapped!

As they have observed, the truck transporting Chairwoman Ulrich is almost completely surrounded.

M4 SOPMOD II: What do we do now?

RO635: We'll clear the road ahead while the others defend against the enemy attack from behind. Once the road is secure, we'll move the VIP on foot!

Bang bang! Bang bang bang!

Gunshots, echoes of artillery fire, running footsteps, mechanical whirs, and the splattering of blood as bodies of flesh are blown up... All these noises weave into the road's only refrain.
Part 2

2

...Five minutes later.

M4 SOPMOD II: Phew... ELIDs are pretty easy to deal with. They're just a bit...gross.

M4 SOPMOD II: But our friends in the back are starting to falter. The enemies are pressing in...

RO635: I'm just glad that you've killed off the one that looked like a Nyto...

Nimogen: You really think I'd be killed so easily?

M4 SOPMOD II: Whoa!

M4 SOPMOD II: You scared the crap outta me!

M4 SOPMOD II: How can you still be alive?! Didn't I blow you up into pieces?!

Nimogen: I would've wiped out all of you right now, but to make Father happy, I must wait till I'm done with more important business.

With that, an object is launched into the truck. Smoke rapidly spreads through the vehicle.

M4 SOPMOD II: Cough, cough cough... It's a smoke grenade!

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, are you back in the truck?

RO635: ...!

RO635: Madam! Crap, the Chairwoman is gone!

M4 SOPMOD II: They just won't let us go!

Clad in black, Nimogen stands proudly at the end of the road, as if waiting to be seen.

She looks in the direction in which the smoke grenade was launched, a cold and sadistic smile on her face.

Nimogen: Heeheehee, we can finally begin, Mercurows. We've kept Father waiting for too long.

Then she vanishes from the Griffin Dolls' view along with the unconscious Chairwoman.

RO635: SOP-II, we must get the Chairwoman back!

RO635: No matter the cost! We must hurry!

...Meanwhile.

In the office of the Bureau of State Security.

Ring—

Zelinsky sits primly in the center of his not particularly well-lit office, staring at the telephone that's emitting an unpleasant ring.

He frowns deeply and dreads having to answer this phone call. After all, it is obvious that this call won't bring any good news.

Click.

The line would probably have disconnected in another two seconds, but Zelinsky still decides to pick up.

On the other end of the call is a voice that Zelinsky finds absolutely odious.

Mysterious Man: What took you so long to answer the phone? I almost thought Statesec was raided by some new secret faction.

Mysterious Man: Glad to see I was just being paranoid.

Zelinsky: ...It isn't funny.

Zelinsky: Just say it. What do you want?

Mysterious Man: I just acquired a fantastic bargaining chip...

Mysterious Man: Your guest is currently enjoying my hospitality.

Zelinsky: ...

Mysterious Man: If you want her alive, give me access to Base 22.

Zelinsky: I don't know what you're talking about.

Mysterious Man: She's such an important diplomat... Is it really okay if she dies?

Mysterious Man: Humans are so fragile when they're at the mercy of these weapons⁠—

Zelinsky: (Interrupts) Statesec doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

Mysterious Man: Oh?

Mysterious Man: Ha, I see. So you never really cared if that woman lives or dies.

Mysterious Man: Which means that's not the point for you... Hmm, I see. You have some other objective, don't you, Mr. Chief?

Zelinsky: ...Like I said, I haven't a clue what you're going on about. Stop this nonsense.

The Chief of Statesec is leaning slightly forward in agitation. He fights the urge to punch himself on the thigh with his clenched left fist and blurts out a crass denial.

The tense silence hanging in the air makes him restless. He fervently wishes the mysterious man would just say something, but...

He also knows that nothing good will come out of his mouth.

Mysterious Man: I know exactly what you want. I also know exactly what Statesec is after.

Zelinsky: ...

Mysterious Man: It's more convenient for you if you just leave certain things to us, don't you think?

Zelinsky: Who...exactly are you?

Mysterious Man: Me? Ha, surely you can hazard a guess?

Mysterious Man: I have been through a lot more than you, Chief.

Mysterious Man: My connections and intelligence network have also extended to places where even Statesec cannot reach.

Mysterious Man: I know you are trying to trace my location. I suggest you save your efforts.

Mysterious Man: You won't get a clue even if I give you another decade to trace me, so let's not waste each other's time. Just give me the security code for Base 22. The Chairwoman will be yours, and you can take all the credit. Why, you can even have the locations of the other 13 bases.

Zelinsky is rendered speechless. With clenched teeth, he stares at a single point in space and frantically rummages through his brain for whatever tiny detail of that particular period of time he might have forgotten.

Zelinsky: How do I know I can trust you?

Mysterious Man: Because you have no other choice. Either we both remain empty-handed, or we can work together for the time being. Hahaha, that's right, a temporary partnership.

Zelinsky grows even more uneasy. Even through the digital distortion, he can hear the sudden chill in the mysterious man's voice.

Mysterious Man: This conversation has gone on for long enough, Chief Zelinsky.

Mysterious Man: I suppose the one thing that time hasn't been able to teach me is patience...

Mysterious Man: So give me an answer soon. This isn't an offer...

Mysterious Man: But an order.
Part 3

    3chevron_right

...On the other end of the battlefield.

In an alleyway.

M4 SOPMOD II: Dammit... Screw everything! That Nyto deliberately showed her face to us before running off!

M4 SOPMOD II: When I find her, I'm gonna tear her in two with my teeth...no, I'll just do it with my hands!

RO635: But first, we must locate the Chairwoman...

RO635: I handed her a signal emitter a while ago just to be safe. That Nyto hasn't gone very far. Rather... Why have they stopped all of a sudden...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Is she giving up? Has she finally figured out that there's no escape from me?!

RO635: Don't be silly... There must be a reason. We'd better be careful. I've sent out the coordinates to everyone else in the team. We'll surround them to make sure they don't slip away.

RO635 promptly marks out several points on the map. SOP-II and the others start moving immediately.

...Ten minutes later.

Outside an abandoned old building.

M4 SOPMOD II: We've already got this battered building surrounded. No one has reported any sign of Nyto or the Chairwoman.

RO635: This is the only place...that Nyto could appear.

M4 SOPMOD II: But no one seems to be stationed here...?

SOP-II points out what is puzzling me. Not a single enemy signal has been detected throughout the entire structure, but for whatever reason, that's also what makes me so apprehensive.

RO635: In any case, let's go in first...

RO635: Stay alert!

...

As we enter the spacious room, we find nothing out of the ordinary... Just Chairwoman Ulrich bound to a wooden chair, watching us barge in with a cheerless smile.

Chairwoman Ulrich: I'm sorry...

...Five minutes ago.

Inside the room at the outpost.

Ulrich glares back at the black-clad woman staring down at her. That smile leaves her slightly unsettled.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Kill me...if you want! But the living won't give in! Do you think you can achieve anything through violence and terrorism?

Nimogen gazes down at Ulrich. Her smile suddenly disappears and her face becomes completely emotionless and serene.

But this new serenity makes the Chairwoman even more uneasy.

Nimogen: I have no interest in humans' capricious "ideals".

Chairwoman Ulrich: Capricious...

Nimogen: No matter how great you claim your "whateverism" is, in the end it's just another way of packaging your own greed. Big yawn.

Nimogen suddenly stops talking. She's still looking at Ulrich, but her eyes are unfocused.

Ulrich naturally doesn't know Nimogen is receiving new commands. All she can see is that after a brief period of dazed silence, that eerie smile returns to Nimogen's face again.

Nimogen: Oh dear, so that's how it is...

Nimogen: You've just become worthless. Heeheehee, that's right, that's what makes it all so interesting~

Nimogen: Now, I'd better go back and teach those pieces of trash a lesson—

Nimogen suddenly stops in her tracks again.

Nimogen: Oh, looks like my cute little sister has run into some trouble. No matter. You lot will soon have to deal with the calamity brought about by your so-called "ideals". Suffering slowly is the only ending you deserve, heeheeheehee...

With that, Nimogen turns to leave.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Wait!

Chairwoman Ulrich: The calamity caused by my ideals... What do you mean by that?

Nimogen glances back at the Chairwoman and gives her a meaningful grin.

Nimogen: You still haven't noticed?

...Back in the present.

Chairwoman Ulrich: She said that, then left.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Then not long afterwards, you appeared at the entrance of the room.

RO635: Calamity... Could she be referring to the ELIDs...?

Chairwoman Ulrich: I don't know... I didn't understand a thing she said...

Chairwoman Ulrich: I don't know who she is or why I've been taken. I also don't understand why she just left after she went to all that trouble to abduct me. But back then she looked like she's completed some kind of mission...

Chairwoman Ulrich: My instinct tells me they must've achieved something very important...

RO635: Something very important...you say?

RO635: In any case, your safety comes first. Let's hurry to the extraction point while we still have time!

RO gently helps Chairwoman Ulrich get up from the chair. The Chairwoman takes her hand in a strong grip.

Chairwoman Ulrich: I know it isn't my place to say this, but the world could be a better place because of you.

Chairwoman Ulrich: No matter what the enemy plans on doing, it can't be anything good. Please stop them if you can.

RO635: And be "a shining beacon in a brave new world"?

Chairwoman Ulrich pauses briefly, then smiles at RO.

Chairwoman Ulrich: Yes, a shining beacon in a brave new world.

RO635: Don't worry. Even if you hadn't asked, we won't let them get away with this.

RO635: Now, Madam, let's go! The Commander is still waiting for us!

An hour after the destruction of the quarantine wall. In the city of Belgrade.

The gunshots and screams have been replaced by the howling gusts crashing through the streets.

No sign of activity can be seen among the buildings.

...With a small exception.

AK-12: All clear. Let's move.

M4A1: Got it.

Two Dolls run through the alleyways one after the other.

One advances in the front while the other walks backward to keep an eye on the rear. They guard each other's backs vigilantly.

AK-12: Stop. The drone detects ELIDs up ahead.

M4A1: Should we go around?

AK-12: There aren't too many of them. We're in a rush so let's plough through them.

AK-12: Just giving you a heads-up so you can prepare for combat. You take the left, I'll focus on the right.

M4A1: Understood. Thanks for the concern.

Their gunshots are muffled by suppressors and the storm. All that can be heard is the Dolls' footsteps and the clangs produced by empty shell casings falling on stone bricks.

After a while, the duo cross the main street, which is littered with human and ELID corpses, and enter another alley.

AK-12: If we're only talking about combat, you might actually make a decent partner.

M4A1: What do you mean?

AK-12: Your friend told me a few things about you so I didn't expect much from you in battle.

M4A1: ...That only serves to illustrate that a deserter who didn't even bother to say goodbye is not a reliable source.

M4A1: People who believe in gossip and pry into others' affairs are even more unreliable.

AK-12: Don't misunderstand, I'm genuinely curious, and I intend to keep observing you like a hawk.

AK-12: But right now we have more important things... Ange? What's the matter?

Ange: Are you reading AN-94's and AR-15's signals?

AK-12: ...Nyet, we haven't received any signals or picked up any transmissions so far.

AK-12: You haven't been able to contact them?

Ange: That's why I'm asking you.

Ange: It's been almost half an hour since they last got in touch. I just have a bad feeling about this.

Ange: How far are you from the opera house?

M4A1: Judging by the direct distance... Another ten minutes on foot, I'd say.

AK-12: Assuming nothing unexpected happens on the way.

M4A1: Have you found the new safe house, Ange?

Ange: Don't worry about me. It's pretty safe where I am. Just focus on re-establishing communication with AN-94 and AR-15.

AK-12: I hope you're right. If you've got ELIDs where you are, we're too far away to run to your rescue, you know.

Ange: Anyway, just get there ASAP. If there's any new information or development, give me a report immediately.

Ange: I can fend for myself. Ange out.

Click.

M4A1: ...Is she going to be alright?

AK-12: Why wouldn't she be?

AK-12: She said she's okay on her own, so she's going to be alright.

M4A1: What a clear and simple answer.

AK-12: It'd be too much to have two Dolls muttering to themselves in Task Force DEFY, don't you think?

M4A1 and AK-12 resume their course toward their destination. After passing through who knows how many streets and alleyways, they finally arrive at a square.

M4A1: Is this the opera house...?

AK-12: Da, this is it. The building facing the square with the bronze statue of a rider.

AK-12: But this terrain... I'm afraid we can't just barge in through the front doors.

M4A1: Didn't Ange tell us to find them ASAP?

AK-12: Better late than never. There's a difference between giving prompt support and waltzing right into a trap.

AK-12: Contrary to the narrow streets with plenty of cover, the square is exposed and can be easily monitored from a high vantage point.

AK-12: Whoever won the fight is most probably ready to take us on.

M4A1: Then what do we do? We're this close already. We can't just stand here and stare at the opera house.

AK-12: Let's take a few minutes to scout around the building first and try to see if anything seems wrong in there.

AK-12: We'll have to enter eventually, but I don't want to be blown into smithereens before we even get inside.

AK-12 may be smug and brash, but her strategies are always extremely cautious.

M4A1 follows her closely through side streets and alleys as they take a slow and convoluted route toward the opera house.

After a while, M4A1 can no longer resist the urge to ask AK-12 this question.

M4A1: Aren't you at all worried about AR-1...AN-94?

AK-12: A little, but not as worried as you are about AR-15.

M4A1: Hmm...

AK-12: Unlike suicidal maniacs like you and AR-15, AN-94 has a very clear idea of who she is and what role she plays.

AK-12: Even if AR-15 wants to do something stupid, I'm sure AN-94 will try to stop her.

M4A1: That's why you seem so carefree...

M4A1: ...Now that I think about it, even though AR-15 and I have always been on the same team, I can't say I know her very well.

M4A1: I haven't been able to have a proper talk with her either ever since we were reunited.

AK-12: Wanna join my Human and Doll Observation Club? If you pay your member's fee now, you can be our second member.

M4A1: ...Is that a joke?

AK-12: Everything you do gives me great insight, even your highly defensive reactions.

M4A1: I can never tell...if you're being serious or not.

AK-12: I am always dead serious.

AK-12: Also, I need to concentrate on searching the area. Please keep an eye on the comms channel and see if you can pick up on anything nearby.

M4A1: ...Nothing.

M4A1: We're already so close but we still haven't heard anything from AR-15 and AN-94.

AK-12: Don't just search for friendly signals. Turn off your IFF for the time being. It'd be great if we can pick up anything even from S.F. or the white things.

M4A1: The only thing I'm receiving is the emergency broadcast channel...

M4A1: They seem to be urging citizens who couldn't make it to bunkers in time to find shelter in the cathedral.

AK-12: Oh? Are they actually being so ostentatious? I'll bet you anything this isn't part of K's plan.

AK-12: It would seem that the Griffin Commander isn't really the type to do things by the book.

M4A1: Yeah... The Commander has helped us out a lot even though we never expected any help.

AK-12: Well, thanks to your Commander's broadcast, I now have a pretty good idea on the situation here.

AK-12: I'm absolutely certain that we'll be walking into an ambush in the opera house.

M4A1: How can you be so sure?

AK-12: The fact that the radio broadcast is still transmitting shows that the interference caused by the storm isn't strong enough to shut down communications in the whole area.

AK-12: However, the opera house is as quiet as a black hole. That's totally unnatural.

M4A1: I see... That means there must be jammers in there.

AK-12: I'm glad to see you're keeping up.

AK-12: We have a tough fight ahead. Are you ready?

M4A1: You bet.

The two Dolls exchange a smile.

Their footsteps soon disappear behind the front doors of the opera house.
Part 2

2

Below the city of Belgrade.

AR-15 and AN-94 keep receiving warnings regarding the red enemy signals that are registered all over their electronic map...

But they have no choice but to ignore these notifications and continue onward.

ST AR-15: ...Why are you siding with S.F., 16?

M16A1: I would've liked to ask you the same question — I wasn't the first deserter on the AR Team.

ST AR-15: I found myself under...special circumstances.

M16A1: I gathered as much. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

ST AR-15: I don't recall you being so sentimental.

M16A1: Who knows? Time can change a lot of things - be it fine wine or Dolls.

M16A1: You yourself are no longer the impulsive kid with a short fuse that you used to be.

ST AR-15: Is that how you saw me...?

AN-94: Don't feed them information, 15! These S.F. must be up to something.

ST AR-15: I know, that's why I need to...

Beak: Hahaha, these Griffin nitwits are so funny!

Beak: You think running your mouth will buy you more time? You think you'll be spared if you don't tell us anything?

ST AR-15: Come and have a go if you're so tough.

M16A1: Relax.

M16A1: If we had wanted you dead, we'd have killed you already.

M16A1: You're still useful for now.

Suddenly, gunshots can be heard from up ahead.

The Sangvis units around them all raise their weapons and go into alert.

M16A1: Send in the decoys to draw their attention. We keep going.

Having received the command, the Sangvis units silently proceed down the underground passage and join the skirmish.

Meanwhile, M16 and the ringleader follow the two DEFY members as they turn into an adjacent cavern and walk on in the direction of the ancient fortress.

The rapid sound of crossfire shows no sign of ceasing. The fight seems to be escalating in the confined labyrinth underground.

Beak: Hey, is this alright? Our forces are melting like butter.

M16A1: There must be more of them than we anticipated.

ST AR-15: Their numbers have multiplied compared to the force that came after us. The white guys must've learned that S.F. is entering the fray.

M16A1: Or maybe they're so determined to get their hands on the Pike Node they're pulling in more units to make sure nothing goes wrong.

M16A1: It would seem...that a bear and a tiger have run into each other in the cave.

ST AR-15: Looks like S.F. is in for a tough fight, as usual.

ST AR-15: But this is a rare reunion between two old friends. Don't you want to see for yourself just how much I've improved?

AN-94: What are you doing, AR-15?!

M16A1: ...Interesting. I might just do that.

Beak: Huh?!

Beak: Are you so drunk you've forgotten which side you're on?

M16A1: These two came from the direction of that ancient fortress... In other words, they know the way back.

M16A1: If they lead the way, we can reach the Pike Node in the least possible amount of time.

Beak: You have a point, but...

ST AR-15: How can you be sure if we won't deliberately lead you into a trap?

M16A1: Simple. As our guides, you'll be walking in front of us.

M16A1: If you draw us into a trap, you'll be the first ones to get killed.

M16A1: If you lead us into a deadend, then you let the white guys win.

AR-15 snickers in response and raises her weapon.

ST AR-15: ...Oh, you honor me so.

ST AR-15: Now the only question is whether you Sangvis trash can keep up with our pace.

ST AR-15: Better stick close to our asses, scumbags!

M16A1: Attention, AR-15 and AN-94 have been designated as Sangvis units. No one has permission to attack them until further notice.

M16A1: Follow their route and proceed.

M16A1: Beak, keep a close eye on them.

Beak: ...Tsk, this is pissing me off!

AN-94 stares at AR-15's back in confusion.

AN-94: What exactly are you doing, AR-15?

ST AR-15: Just taking a chance and making it up as we go.

ST AR-15: Trust me just this once.

AN-94: Alright, at least now we are free to use our weapons...

AN-94: Though we've practically become cannon fodder for Sangvis Ferri.

ST AR-15: Neither of us can die before Ange's reinforcements arrive.

ST AR-15: At least not when we haven't achieved anything... No chance at all.

Rapid gunshots soon interrupt the conversation.

With the two Dolls in the lead, the Sangvis forces charge into the subterranean battlefield filled with White Faction units.

These ancient tunnels are suddenly swarmed by an unprecedented amount of wayfarers, making it unusually clamorous.

The dank subterranean air is slowly heating up with bullets flying around and blasts going off everywhere.

ST AR-15: Cover!

AN-94: Got it!

The two DEFY members in the forefront cut through the fight like honed spears.

Advance, fire, halt, cover the other, and so on...

They work together as perfectly as two gears in a piece of clockwork.

AN-94: Cover!

ST AR-15: Go!

ST AR-15: ...Ow!

AN-94: AR-15!

A bullet whizzes past AR-15 before she even sensed the white enemy attacking from behind.

Hearing a loud boom, she turns to find the white unit smashed into the wall by the wheel of a heavy motorcycle.

Beak: You're telling me these are the most advanced elite Dolls created by IOP and the Military?

Beak: They can't even handle the small fry. Talk about being disappointed.

AN-94: Are you alright, AR-15?

ST AR-15: I'm fine, but...what's the deal with her?

Beak: Don't think I can't hear you just because you're whispering!

The Sangvis ringleader hops off her bike and fires into the side passage with a hidden trapdoor.

With every shot she fires, a spray of blood splatters onto the walls. The metallic odor of blood soon obfuscates the original smell of gunpowder.

Beak: C'mon then, you pieces of junk.

Beak: I have a LOT of pent-up anger waiting to be vented!

As AR-15 watches the Sangvis ringleader mutilate the white unit with overwhelming power and speed, an idea occurs to her and she carefully asks...

ST AR-15: Griffin has no record of you. Are you really a Sangvis Doll?

Beak: ...How dare a Griffin riffraff question my pedigree?!

Beak: Say, aren't you hostages too full of yourselves?!

AN-94: If you aren't in S.F.'s basic model register...could you be...a new model developed independently by Sangvis Ferri?

AN-94: Just how many cards does Mastermind have up her sleeve?

Beak: It's obvious what you're doing. You'll have to try harder to trick me into giving things away.

Beak: Still, I'm not the first model to have been created by our own AI, nor will I be the last.

Beak: Sangvis Ferri has just as many cards up our sleeves as any rotten human.

Beak: Lead on, lackeys of human scum. Don't die so easily!

ST AR-15: Is it a good thing or a bad thing to have this Doll behind us...?

AN-94: ...It's not entirely a bad thing.

AN-94: Having observed her, I believe we might be able to...get along with her.

For some strange reason, seeing that faint smile on AN-94's lips, AR-15 can't help but grin back at her.

She knows that confident smile means there is hope in turning the situation around.
Part 3

3

Pushing open the door reveals a dark and empty theater stage.

The debris all over the ground, the bullet holes scattered across the room, and the pungent smell of burnt flesh all indicate that a ferocious battle took place here not long ago.

AK-12: Looks like we're alone.

M4A1: But this is where they last communicated with us. Where have they gone...?

Whoosh!

M4A1: It's...Sangvis Ferri! You're from back then...

Executioner: It's been a long time, ditzy young lady. Have you missed me?

Executioner dashes at them from behind with her long blade, but M4 blocks her attack with her weapon case.

Before M4 can reply, a swift and accurate burst of bullets forces Executioner to take evasive maneuvers.

AK-12: Stay back, M4! Leave this to...whoa!

Clash!

Hunter: An unfamiliar Griffin Doll. What interesting prey.

Hunter: However, Executioner said she wanted to take M4A1's head as a souvenir...

Hunter: ...So you mustn't get in the way.

A large amount of Sangvis units come swarming into the theater and start launching a fierce attack under the coordination of the two Sangvis ringleaders.

M4A1 and AK-12, now separated from each other, have to fight alone on opposite ends of the auditorium.

Executioner: Hahahahaha, you've grown a lot stronger, but so have I!

Executioner: It's been a while since I last fought such an exhilirating battle!

M4A1: I expected this, but their numbers are far greater than I imagined...

M4A1: If we don't take out the ringleaders soon, we're going to waste a lot of time here...

Clear Voice: There's a hidden passage in this theater that leads where everyone is trying to get to.

M4A1: Do you know where it is?

Clear Voice: One of the floorboards in the backstage area is hollow.

M4A1: But if I go in blindly, I could run into even more S.F. and white units...

M4A1: And AK-12 is...

Clear Voice: You'll have to go around the Sangvis units. As for the white ones, I can handle them no matter how many of them there are.

Clear Voice: If you want to help your partner, you'll have to trust me. You should also have some faith in your friend.

M4A1: Then...AK-12!

AK-12: ...!

The moment their eyes meet, Executioner's and Hunter's attacks force them apart and send them running again.

Hunter: As if we'd let you join forces.

Executioner: Why are you running? Fight me fair and square, M4A1!

Backed to the edge of the auditorium, M4A1 stops and turns around. Executioner flashes her a genuine smile.

Executioner: That's it! Let's fight until one of us drops dead!

M4A1: Do it!

Executioner: Huh?

A massive explosion goes off.

The Sangvis forces are blown up into pieces, their debris falling all around like unseasonal snow.

The explosion has blasted a large hole on half of the theater wall, dust and rubble come crashing down onto the stage like a landslide.

Executioner: Cough cough...! That...was a bomb? When...

Hunter: Watch out, Executioner!

The explosion has thrown Executioner onto the stage. The last image she sees is M4 lifting her weapon case and aiming at her.

With a deafening boom, Executioner is reduced to ashes along with the stage.

AK-12: That was trickier than I expected...

AK-12: Good thing we anticipated the possibility of walking into an ambush and rigged a bomb outside beforehand.

Beneath the decimated stage, M4 finds the entrance to the secret passage and runs up to it.

M4A1: I'm leaving things here to you!

AK-12: Go, M4!

AK-12: No matter what you want to do, do it!

Hunter: You think we'll let you have your way?!

A heavily-wounded Hunter aims her gun at M4's back, but AK-12 shoots her weapon out of her hands.

Hunter: Ugh!

Hunter: You Griffin bastards...!

AK-12: Sangvis Manufacture Model SP721, "Hunter", isn't it?

AK-12: Actually...I'm not with Griffin.

AK-12: And just like your friend, you will soon pay the price for your ignorance.
Part 4

4

...Under the city of Belgrade.

Even though every shot fired finds its target and tears a white unit to pieces...

The number of enemies blocking their way shows no sign of decreasing.

Beak: Trash is trash, no matter how many there is!

But despite her bravado, Sangvis units keep dropping like flies all around her under the hail of enemy fire.

Soon enough, Beak finds herself heavily suppressed.

Beak: Trying to overwhelm me with sheer numbers?

Beak: Perfect. Now I don't even have to worry about wasting ammo! You're just begging to be killed!

Beak: Get ready to...hmm?!

Suddenly, a ferocious swathe of bullets tears right through the white enemy's formation. Shot after shot accurately targets the deadly weaknesses on each and every white unit, taking all enemies down like a violent torrent.

AN-94: All clear. I'll go on and scout ahead.

ST AR-15: Right, leave this place to me.

Beak: It's you...!

Beak: I'm surprised to see that even Griffin dogs know how to repay a debt.

ST AR-15: This has nothing to do with the aid you provided earlier. We're merely clearing the path so that we may proceed smoothly.

Beak: Humph, funny you'd say that. Are you sure we're going the right way?

Beak: Why do you have to pick a path that's packed with enemies?

ST AR-15: More white enemies means more forces stationed around to guard something important, don't you think?

ST AR-15: The fiercer their resistance, the more certain we can be that we're going in the right direction.

Beak: That does make sense...

Beak: But when did you move behind me? The path is up ahead.

Beak: Besides, haven't I been following your butts the whole time?

ST AR-15: Well, actually... It would seem someone wants to get off early.

Beak: ??!!

A blow on the back of the head with a blunt instrument...

Vision dissolving into black-and-white static... A distracting noise in the ear drowning out everything else.

With a blank look in her eyes, Beak slumps unsteadily off her motorbike.

Through the blurry visual snow, she can just make out AN-94 and AR-15 moving to the side of the passage and giving the wall a push...

ST AR-15: Well done, AN-94.

ST AR-15: Good luck, Sangvis. You'll need it.

Beak: ...Freaking lackeys of mankind! Go to hell!

Even though her vision is severely impaired, Beak still raises her arm with great difficulty and fires randomly at the trapdoor that Task Force DEFY escapes through until she runs out of ammunition.

After an uncertain amount of time, Beak's eyes snap open. She jumps back on her feet and looks around.

Other than her own motorbike and the pile of remains of the white forces, there is no sign of the two hostage Dolls.

Beak: Did they...hack me and overload my neural cloud?!

Beak: Dammit, they must've disappeared through here...

Feeling along the wall the AR-15 and AN-94 climbed through, she finds the trapdoor. However, the lock has already been set to only allow one-way access. It can no longer be opened from this side.

She smashes the electronic control interface of the door with a furious punch.

Beak: Arghhhh... Bastards! You bastards! You planned this, you rubbish Dolls!

M16A1: What's going on?

Beak: It's all your fault! You should've come sooner!

M16A1: Oh yeah? We're already at the end of the underground passage. Our destination is just a few steps ahead.

M16A1: The doors leading to the Pike Node is right in front of us... We don't need the guides anymore. We simply have to kill anything that tries to stop us from getting there.

Beak: Humph, and don't you sound pleased?

Beak: If they hadn't escaped, would you follow the plan and execute them once we secure the Pike Node?

M16A1: We're here to complete a mission, not to chase after a couple of rats.

M16A1: If we give Agent and Mastermind a complete account of what happened, who do you think will look more incompetent, you or me?

Beak: You're a sneaky one... You always manage to find excuses for yourself.

M16A1: You'd better try harder. It'd be awkward if my supervisor ends up being the one who needs supervision.

M16A1: That little slip-up of yours was no big deal. After all, our objective concerns something far more important than the fate of two Dolls.

M16A1: I have another job for you. Don't screw it up.

Beak: Screw up? Humph, save that for yourself.

Beak mounts her motorbike again and drives out of the underground passage in a separate direction.

Meanwhile, M16 studies the end of the passage - the secret chamber locked behind a set of heavy doors underneath the ancient fortress.

All the Sangvis units that survived the tumultuous journey through the subterraneon labyrinth gather behind M16 and follow her as they head toward their final destination.
Part 5

5

...Under the city of Belgrade.

Bang bang bang! Ba-bang bang bang bang bang...!

M4A1: More gunfire...

Detecting another battle ahead, M4 slows down and listens for a while.

M4A1: ...I can't hear AR-15's or AN-94's gunshots.

M4A1: In that case, there's no need for me to intervene. I can simply go around it.

Clear Voice: You've grown more prudent.

M4A1: This is a rescue mission. I can't very well get myself killed as well.

M4A1: Now that I'm on a solo mission, there's no room for mistakes.

Clear Voice: Perhaps you aren't actually on your own.

M4A1: I just hope you won't slow me down.

Clear Voice: Sangvis Ferri aren't tough enemies to you since you're very familiar with them.

Clear Voice: But the same can't be said about the White Faction, right?

M4A1: I do have a general idea about them... I've received data from Ange.

M4A1: I know their physical traits and how to fight them.

Clear Voice: But what if I tell you there's an easier way...where you can beat them without even having to fight?

M4A1: I'd welcome that. I don't have the ammo to spare on unnecessary foes.

M4A1: ...Is there actually such a convenient option?

Clear Voice: Of course. It isn't effective against all white units, but those Nytos...

Clear Voice: Their construction is special... Not unlike ours, actually.

M4A1: Nytos... You mean the commanders of the white forces?

Clear Voice: That's right. The other units' operation is based on manual input; your capacity may be relatively low, but seizing control over them from such a close distance should be a piece of cake for you.

Clear Voice: But the Nytos are different. I can't sense their neural clouds. Those clones' neural pathways don't seem to be augmented with any kind of machinery at all.

M4A1: You're saying...they're actually human?

Clear Voice: More like creatures made in the image of humans. For some reason, I have a feeling that I can establish a connection with them despite the lack of a neural cloud.

M4A1: In that case, I just have to catch a Nyto and you can hack her to seize command over the White Faction.

Clear Voice: It would seem that the blocking device they're wearing on the head - the one that looks like a hairband - can block out all invasive signals.

Clear Voice: Is there something special about the construction of their brain?

Clear Voice: In any case, I need you to help me by destroying that blocking device.

M4A1: That's stupid.

M4A1: If I can fire at a Nyto's blocking device, why don't I simply blast her head open?

Clear Voice: Even if you kill one, another will soon take over her command authorizations. I'm curious about them.

Clear Voice: If I can set up a connection, I'm sure I'll be able to learn more.

Clear Voice: Besides, getting our hands on a live Nyto would save us the effort of fighting through endless waves of enemies.

M4A1: ...It could be worth a try if we've got a chance. Hmm?

Bang bang bang! Bang bang bang bang...

M4A1: Another battle...and a ferocious one. Wait, that gun sounds like...

M4A1: AR-15? AN-94 is here as well...!

Realizing that her teammates are very close by, M4 breaks into a run in the direction of the gunshots.

The moment she makes a turn around the corner, she finds two muzzles pointing straight at her.

M4A1: Don't shoot, it's me!

ST AR-15: ...M4?

AN-94: Not an enemy... Good.

AN-94 lowers her gun and leans against the wall. As she starts slumping onto the ground, AR-15 dashes to her side and supports her with a shoulder.

M4A1: What's the matter? Are you hurt?

ST AR-15: She got shot behind the right knee. We need some time to treat it.

AN-94: I can't believe I let her last aimless shots get me... It's a disgrace...

AN-94: Where is AK-12? Is she not with you?

M4A1: She stayed behind upstairs to draw the S.F. away so that I can get to you first.

AN-94: I see. It's a sound strategy.

AN-94: She'll be fine on her own.

M4A1: But what on earth happened here? I came across heaps of dead S.F. and white units along the way.

ST AR-15: I'll try to keep it short, though that might be a bit difficult.

ST AR-15: ...Anyway, please try to keep calm about what I'm about to say.

M4A1: ...M16 is here as well?

ST AR-15: Indeed. In fact, she seems to be the one in command in the frontlines.

AN-94: She's become incredibly formidable. We alone are also no match for the various Sangvis ringleaders under her command.

AN-94: Not to mention the two Nytos and the horde of white stuff that almost seem as if they can self-replicate.

AN-94: I believe all we can do for now is to retreat and wait for more support.

M4A1: No, it'll be too late by then.

ST AR-15: I know you have things to sort out with her, M4, but there's only so much we can do. Just escaping alive would be...

M4A1: I actually have a way to deal with the white forces. More specifically, the Nytos.

M4A1: If we can take out the blocking device around a Nyto's head...

ST AR-15: ...They can be hacked?!

ST AR-15: Well, that is a very useful piece of information, but we're being pursued by two Nytos.

ST AR-15: Even if we get one, the other will take over command right away.

Clear Voice: Then we get them both at the same time. We destroy both Nytos' blocking devices.

M4A1 lowers her head to think. After a few seconds of muttering, she looks up again.

M4A1: Then we get them both at the same time. We destroy both Nytos' blocking devices.

M4A1: Don't give them any time to react.

AN-94: That's too risky. Sangvis Ferri and the White Faction are now in an all-out war fighting over the Pike Node - it's total chaos.

AN-94: Firing at both Nytos under such circumstances is...

ST AR-15: No, we can do it.

AR-15 claps M4 and AN-94 on the shoulder.

ST AR-15: We're different than what we used to be.

ST AR-15: I know that as long as M4 gives the order, I'll keep up.

M4A1: ...Right.

ST AR-15: AN-94, just stay here and do some simple repairs on yourself. Also, fill Ange and AK-12 in on what's going on here.

ST AR-15: You're our last fail-safe. We're counting on you.

AN-94: Alright, I can see that you've made up your mind.

AN-94: But here's another question - even if you manage to take down the White Faction, what are you planning to do about the remaining Sangvis forces?

M4A1: I'll...have a proper word with M16.

M4A1: If it can't be helped, then I'll settle everything by my own hand.

A bright fire seems to be flickering in M4's eyes.

Is that the desire for the truth...or the thirst for vengeance?

Whichever it is, AN-94 knows that she shouldn't ask any further questions...because it won't change anything.
Part 6

6

...Under the city of Belgrade.

Nimogen: Is that the best you can do, Sangvis Ferri? What an utter disgrace.

Mercurows: Oh, Pestilence! Oh, War! Oh, Famine! And I - am Death!

Mercurows: Here to deliver your bespoke demise!

Even under the pervasive and deafening barrage, the condescending smile and over-the-top inflection are transmitted to M16's transciever with perfect clarity.

M16A1: This isn't the first time I've been in this kind of situation, but I must say I'm surprised.

M16A1: We're hopelessly outmatched.

M16A1: Even though they've already opened the doors to the Node, we haven't even been able to take a single step inside...

The Sangvis forces are quite literally being cut down by the White Faction, completely unable to fight back.

The dazzling lasers, continuously exploding grenades, and never-ending gunshots together weave a symphony following the Nytos' conducting gestures.

It's as if an opera duet titled "Carnage" is being performed in these depths of this city.

Nimogen: In the end, these so-called Sangvis are exactly like the Griffins - nothing more than stinking rats sneaking around the sewers.

Nimogen: What's the point in playing hard-to-get? Come on out and let me put an end to this meaningless battle.

Mercurows: Without destruction, there will be no rebirth!

Mercurows: Oh, my angels, sound the trumpet! Unleash the devastation!

Mercurows: In the name of the Father, let the world burn in the lake of fire!

Under the overwhelming firepower of the massive amount of white units, the Sangvis forces are slowly pushed back until they're huddling together as a compact group in the center of the White Faction's encirclement.

However, despite the extreme disadvantage her forces are in, M16's face remains totally impassive.

M16A1: I didn't want to do this, but...

Suddenly, M16 raises an eyebrow almost imperceptibly.

M16A1: Gunfire?

M16A1: A single...no, two shots fired simultaneously?

Some distinctive noises can be heard from amidst the commotion of intense crossfire.

On the other side of the passage...

ST AR-15: Did I miss? Then I'll just get in another shot...

M4A1: Wait, look!

The gunfire gradually dies down, and the white units come to a halt one after the other. They all freeze in place like puppets whose strings are cut.

With M4's and AR-15's weapons still trained on them, the two Nytos merely look stunned.

But unlike the white units, one of them is still capable of movement. She slowly looks down and stares at the her broken hairband lying on the ground in pieces. Then...

Nimogen: AAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!!

Nimogen: It-it hurts! Fa-Father! Help me!

Nimogen: Who was it?! Who did this?! Stop it! Don't come in! It hurts! It hurts! AHHH...AAAAHHHHHHH!!!

The piercing wails break the silence and these high-pitched shrieks slowly turn into hoarse moans.

The crazed Nyto stumbles her way through the inanimate legion of white units and makes a clumsy escape.

As she scrambles away, the white forces also drop their weapons and fall over each other trying to reach the exit.

As for the other Nyto, she's still frozen on the spot, completely motionless.

ST AR-15: ...It worked! The white forces have gone out of control!

ST AR-15: You're pretty good when you put your heart in it, M4.

M4A1: The plan could only work with your help.

ST AR-15: Still, how did you do that?

ST AR-15: I mean, so we know that the blocking device is a weak spot, but even AN-94, who specializes in electronic warfare, wouldn't have been able to hack two Nytos so quickly.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: What on earth happened? Why could I hack those Nyto...those people?

M4A1: I suppose I've learned a few new tricks since we last saw each other.

ST AR-15: Glad to see you've become so dependable. I'd better put more effort in improving myself as well.

ST AR-15: Now that we've dealt with the white stuff, it's time to settle things with Sangvis Ferri...and her, isn't that right?

M4A1: Hold on.

Following M4A1's gaze, AR-15 looks over to the Nyto still standing there like a statue.

M4A1: ...I've still got some questions that need answering.
Part 7

    7chevron_right

...Belgrade underground, outside the doors to the Pike Node.

As the White Faction starts falling into disorder, Sangvis Ferri promptly begins its counterattack.

The Sangvis troops start shooting one-sidedly at every single white unit that hasn't escaped in time.

M4A1: ...I've still got some questions that need answering.

ST AR-15: Didn't that Nyto's brains get cooked?

M4A1: I'm afraid not.

The Nyto slowly raises her head, proving M4's words to be true.

She looks around with wide eyes full of panic and no sign of her characteristic flair for the dramatic.

ST AR-15: Hands up, don't move!

Mercurows: U-um, excuse me, where is my sister?

ST AR-15: Drop the nonsense! Hands in the air!

Mercurows: Her name is Nyto, like mine. Though Father did promise to give us new names if we complete our mission...

Mercurows: Did anyone see where she's gone? ...Oh.

Mercurows' eyes meet M4's, and she walks toward her.

Mercurows: Sister? Is that you, sister?

ST AR-15: Huh...?

M4A1: ...

Mercurows: Thank goodness you're here! You gave me such a scare. I suddenly stopped sensing your presence.

Mercurows: But now that I can see you're safe, I...

Bang bang bang!

A series of gunshots put a halt to Mercurow's attempt to approach M4. She never managed to reach her.

A genuine, relieved smile remains frozen on her face...

With the same sweet and innocent expression, and blood trickling out of her nose and mouth, she collapses onto the ground.

ST AR-15: Watch out, M4! Here she comes!

M4A1: ...I know.

On the other end of the underground passage, the familiar yet slightly different figure appears.

M4A1: Why did you kill her?

M16A1: It's only been a while, but you've already gotten too soft to deal your enemy the killing blow.

M4A1: ...What did she know that you're trying to stop me from finding out?

M16A1: There are way too many things that you shouldn't know.

M16A1: You...can hear the voice, can't you?

M4A1: So what if I can?

M16A1: No matter what it tells you, don't believe it.

M16A1: You only made it here alive because you've been using powers that aren't your own.

M4A1: But at least I'm still alive. That still beats betraying your old teammates.

M4A1: I really don't want to believe it, but...you don't seem to be under Sangvis control.

M16A1: ...I know. I am fully aware of what I'm doing.

M4A1: Then why won't you come back, 16?!

M4A1: Come home to Griffin. We can solve any problem together.

M16A1: It's one of their objectives to reunite us...so I can't go back yet. At least not now.

M4A1: Then at least tell me the truth.

M4A1: Don't be an accomplice of Sangvis Ferri! Don't help them spread death and destruction to innocent people!

M16A1: There isn't room for negotiation between us right now.

M16A1: I don't want you to get what's behind those doors...so back off, or we'll have to decide who takes the prize with a fight.

M4 lifts her weapon and AR-15 follows suit. The situation is quickly becoming touch-and-go.

At that moment.

M16A1: Looks like it's gonna be sooner than I expected... See you.

Beak: Yeeeeeeeee-haw!

M4A1: Huh...?

With a deafening vroom, a large motorbike comes skidding through the underground passage, followed by a truck.

ST AR-15: M4, look out!

AR-15 dives onto M4 and pushes her out of the way of the motorbike.

By the time they get back on their feet, the Sangvis convoy is already gone.

ST AR-15: Are you okay, M4?

M4A1: ...We're going after them.

ST AR-15: Huh?

M4A1: It's not over yet. I won't let it end just like that. Let's go!

ST AR-15: ...Understood!

An hour after the destruction of the quarantine wall. In the city of Belgrade.

The gunshots and screams have been replaced by the howling gusts crashing through the streets.

No sign of activity can be seen among the buildings.

...With a small exception.

AK-12: All clear. Let's move.

M4A1: Got it.

Two Dolls run through the alleyways one after the other.

One advances in the front while the other walks backward to keep an eye on the rear. They guard each other's backs vigilantly.

AK-12: Stop. The drone detects ELIDs up ahead.

M4A1: Should we go around?

AK-12: There aren't too many of them. We're in a rush so let's plough through them.

AK-12: Just giving you a heads-up so you can prepare for combat. You take the left, I'll focus on the right.

M4A1: Understood. Thanks for the concern.

Their gunshots are muffled by suppressors and the storm. All that can be heard is the Dolls' footsteps and the clangs produced by empty shell casings falling on stone bricks.

After a while, the duo cross the main street, which is littered with human and ELID corpses, and enter another alley.

AK-12: If we're only talking about combat, you might actually make a decent partner.

M4A1: What do you mean?

AK-12: Your friend told me a few things about you so I didn't expect much from you in battle.

M4A1: ...That only serves to illustrate that a deserter who didn't even bother to say goodbye is not a reliable source.

M4A1: People who believe in gossip and pry into others' affairs are even more unreliable.

AK-12: Don't misunderstand, I'm genuinely curious, and I intend to keep observing you like a hawk.

AK-12: But right now we have more important things... Ange? What's the matter?

Ange: Are you reading AN-94's and AR-15's signals?

AK-12: ...Nyet, we haven't received any signals or picked up any transmissions so far.

AK-12: You haven't been able to contact them?

Ange: That's why I'm asking you.

Ange: It's been almost half an hour since they last got in touch. I just have a bad feeling about this.

Ange: How far are you from the opera house?

M4A1: Judging by the direct distance... Another ten minutes on foot, I'd say.

AK-12: Assuming nothing unexpected happens on the way.

M4A1: Have you found the new safe house, Ange?

Ange: Don't worry about me. It's pretty safe where I am. Just focus on re-establishing communication with AN-94 and AR-15.

AK-12: I hope you're right. If you've got ELIDs where you are, we're too far away to run to your rescue, you know.

Ange: Anyway, just get there ASAP. If there's any new information or development, give me a report immediately.

Ange: I can fend for myself. Ange out.

Click.

M4A1: ...Is she going to be alright?

AK-12: Why wouldn't she be?

AK-12: She said she's okay on her own, so she's going to be alright.

M4A1: What a clear and simple answer.

AK-12: It'd be too much to have two Dolls muttering to themselves in Task Force DEFY, don't you think?

M4A1 and AK-12 resume their course toward their destination. After passing through who knows how many streets and alleyways, they finally arrive at a square.

M4A1: Is this the opera house...?

AK-12: Da, this is it. The building facing the square with the bronze statue of a rider.

AK-12: But this terrain... I'm afraid we can't just barge in through the front doors.

M4A1: Didn't Ange tell us to find them ASAP?

AK-12: Better late than never. There's a difference between giving prompt support and waltzing right into a trap.

AK-12: Contrary to the narrow streets with plenty of cover, the square is exposed and can be easily monitored from a high vantage point.

AK-12: Whoever won the fight is most probably ready to take us on.

M4A1: Then what do we do? We're this close already. We can't just stand here and stare at the opera house.

AK-12: Let's take a few minutes to scout around the building first and try to see if anything seems wrong in there.

AK-12: We'll have to enter eventually, but I don't want to be blown into smithereens before we even get inside.

AK-12 may be smug and brash, but her strategies are always extremely cautious.

M4A1 follows her closely through side streets and alleys as they take a slow and convoluted route toward the opera house.

After a while, M4A1 can no longer resist the urge to ask AK-12 this question.

M4A1: Aren't you at all worried about AR-1...AN-94?

AK-12: A little, but not as worried as you are about AR-15.

M4A1: Hmm...

AK-12: Unlike suicidal maniacs like you and AR-15, AN-94 has a very clear idea of who she is and what role she plays.

AK-12: Even if AR-15 wants to do something stupid, I'm sure AN-94 will try to stop her.

M4A1: That's why you seem so carefree...

M4A1: ...Now that I think about it, even though AR-15 and I have always been on the same team, I can't say I know her very well.

M4A1: I haven't been able to have a proper talk with her either ever since we were reunited.

AK-12: Wanna join my Human and Doll Observation Club? If you pay your member's fee now, you can be our second member.

M4A1: ...Is that a joke?

AK-12: Everything you do gives me great insight, even your highly defensive reactions.

M4A1: I can never tell...if you're being serious or not.

AK-12: I am always dead serious.

AK-12: Also, I need to concentrate on searching the area. Please keep an eye on the comms channel and see if you can pick up on anything nearby.

M4A1: ...Nothing.

M4A1: We're already so close but we still haven't heard anything from AR-15 and AN-94.

AK-12: Don't just search for friendly signals. Turn off your IFF for the time being. It'd be great if we can pick up anything even from S.F. or the white things.

M4A1: The only thing I'm receiving is the emergency broadcast channel...

M4A1: They seem to be urging citizens who couldn't make it to bunkers in time to find shelter in the cathedral.

AK-12: Oh? Are they actually being so ostentatious? I'll bet you anything this isn't part of K's plan.

AK-12: It would seem that the Griffin Commander isn't really the type to do things by the book.

M4A1: Yeah... The Commander has helped us out a lot even though we never expected any help.

AK-12: Well, thanks to your Commander's broadcast, I now have a pretty good idea on the situation here.

AK-12: I'm absolutely certain that we'll be walking into an ambush in the opera house.

M4A1: How can you be so sure?

AK-12: The fact that the radio broadcast is still transmitting shows that the interference caused by the storm isn't strong enough to shut down communications in the whole area.

AK-12: However, the opera house is as quiet as a black hole. That's totally unnatural.

M4A1: I see... That means there must be jammers in there.

AK-12: I'm glad to see you're keeping up.

AK-12: We have a tough fight ahead. Are you ready?

M4A1: You bet.

The two Dolls exchange a smile.

Their footsteps soon disappear behind the front doors of the opera house.
Part 2

2

Below the city of Belgrade.

AR-15 and AN-94 keep receiving warnings regarding the red enemy signals that are registered all over their electronic map...

But they have no choice but to ignore these notifications and continue onward.

ST AR-15: ...Why are you siding with S.F., 16?

M16A1: I would've liked to ask you the same question — I wasn't the first deserter on the AR Team.

ST AR-15: I found myself under...special circumstances.

M16A1: I gathered as much. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

ST AR-15: I don't recall you being so sentimental.

M16A1: Who knows? Time can change a lot of things - be it fine wine or Dolls.

M16A1: You yourself are no longer the impulsive kid with a short fuse that you used to be.

ST AR-15: Is that how you saw me...?

AN-94: Don't feed them information, 15! These S.F. must be up to something.

ST AR-15: I know, that's why I need to...

Beak: Hahaha, these Griffin nitwits are so funny!

Beak: You think running your mouth will buy you more time? You think you'll be spared if you don't tell us anything?

ST AR-15: Come and have a go if you're so tough.

M16A1: Relax.

M16A1: If we had wanted you dead, we'd have killed you already.

M16A1: You're still useful for now.

Suddenly, gunshots can be heard from up ahead.

The Sangvis units around them all raise their weapons and go into alert.

M16A1: Send in the decoys to draw their attention. We keep going.

Having received the command, the Sangvis units silently proceed down the underground passage and join the skirmish.

Meanwhile, M16 and the ringleader follow the two DEFY members as they turn into an adjacent cavern and walk on in the direction of the ancient fortress.

The rapid sound of crossfire shows no sign of ceasing. The fight seems to be escalating in the confined labyrinth underground.

Beak: Hey, is this alright? Our forces are melting like butter.

M16A1: There must be more of them than we anticipated.

ST AR-15: Their numbers have multiplied compared to the force that came after us. The white guys must've learned that S.F. is entering the fray.

M16A1: Or maybe they're so determined to get their hands on the Pike Node they're pulling in more units to make sure nothing goes wrong.

M16A1: It would seem...that a bear and a tiger have run into each other in the cave.

ST AR-15: Looks like S.F. is in for a tough fight, as usual.

ST AR-15: But this is a rare reunion between two old friends. Don't you want to see for yourself just how much I've improved?

AN-94: What are you doing, AR-15?!

M16A1: ...Interesting. I might just do that.

Beak: Huh?!

Beak: Are you so drunk you've forgotten which side you're on?

M16A1: These two came from the direction of that ancient fortress... In other words, they know the way back.

M16A1: If they lead the way, we can reach the Pike Node in the least possible amount of time.

Beak: You have a point, but...

ST AR-15: How can you be sure if we won't deliberately lead you into a trap?

M16A1: Simple. As our guides, you'll be walking in front of us.

M16A1: If you draw us into a trap, you'll be the first ones to get killed.

M16A1: If you lead us into a deadend, then you let the white guys win.

AR-15 snickers in response and raises her weapon.

ST AR-15: ...Oh, you honor me so.

ST AR-15: Now the only question is whether you Sangvis trash can keep up with our pace.

ST AR-15: Better stick close to our asses, scumbags!

M16A1: Attention, AR-15 and AN-94 have been designated as Sangvis units. No one has permission to attack them until further notice.

M16A1: Follow their route and proceed.

M16A1: Beak, keep a close eye on them.

Beak: ...Tsk, this is pissing me off!

AN-94 stares at AR-15's back in confusion.

AN-94: What exactly are you doing, AR-15?

ST AR-15: Just taking a chance and making it up as we go.

ST AR-15: Trust me just this once.

AN-94: Alright, at least now we are free to use our weapons...

AN-94: Though we've practically become cannon fodder for Sangvis Ferri.

ST AR-15: Neither of us can die before Ange's reinforcements arrive.

ST AR-15: At least not when we haven't achieved anything... No chance at all.

Rapid gunshots soon interrupt the conversation.

With the two Dolls in the lead, the Sangvis forces charge into the subterranean battlefield filled with White Faction units.

These ancient tunnels are suddenly swarmed by an unprecedented amount of wayfarers, making it unusually clamorous.

The dank subterranean air is slowly heating up with bullets flying around and blasts going off everywhere.

ST AR-15: Cover!

AN-94: Got it!

The two DEFY members in the forefront cut through the fight like honed spears.

Advance, fire, halt, cover the other, and so on...

They work together as perfectly as two gears in a piece of clockwork.

AN-94: Cover!

ST AR-15: Go!

ST AR-15: ...Ow!

AN-94: AR-15!

A bullet whizzes past AR-15 before she even sensed the white enemy attacking from behind.

Hearing a loud boom, she turns to find the white unit smashed into the wall by the wheel of a heavy motorcycle.

Beak: You're telling me these are the most advanced elite Dolls created by IOP and the Military?

Beak: They can't even handle the small fry. Talk about being disappointed.

AN-94: Are you alright, AR-15?

ST AR-15: I'm fine, but...what's the deal with her?

Beak: Don't think I can't hear you just because you're whispering!

The Sangvis ringleader hops off her bike and fires into the side passage with a hidden trapdoor.

With every shot she fires, a spray of blood splatters onto the walls. The metallic odor of blood soon obfuscates the original smell of gunpowder.

Beak: C'mon then, you pieces of junk.

Beak: I have a LOT of pent-up anger waiting to be vented!

As AR-15 watches the Sangvis ringleader mutilate the white unit with overwhelming power and speed, an idea occurs to her and she carefully asks...

ST AR-15: Griffin has no record of you. Are you really a Sangvis Doll?

Beak: ...How dare a Griffin riffraff question my pedigree?!

Beak: Say, aren't you hostages too full of yourselves?!

AN-94: If you aren't in S.F.'s basic model register...could you be...a new model developed independently by Sangvis Ferri?

AN-94: Just how many cards does Mastermind have up her sleeve?

Beak: It's obvious what you're doing. You'll have to try harder to trick me into giving things away.

Beak: Still, I'm not the first model to have been created by our own AI, nor will I be the last.

Beak: Sangvis Ferri has just as many cards up our sleeves as any rotten human.

Beak: Lead on, lackeys of human scum. Don't die so easily!

ST AR-15: Is it a good thing or a bad thing to have this Doll behind us...?

AN-94: ...It's not entirely a bad thing.

AN-94: Having observed her, I believe we might be able to...get along with her.

For some strange reason, seeing that faint smile on AN-94's lips, AR-15 can't help but grin back at her.

She knows that confident smile means there is hope in turning the situation around.
Part 3

Pushing open the door reveals a dark and empty theater stage.

The debris all over the ground, the bullet holes scattered across the room, and the pungent smell of burnt flesh all indicate that a ferocious battle took place here not long ago.

AK-12: Looks like we're alone.

M4A1: But this is where they last communicated with us. Where have they gone...?

Whoosh!

M4A1: It's...Sangvis Ferri! You're from back then...

Executioner: It's been a long time, ditzy young lady. Have you missed me?

Executioner dashes at them from behind with her long blade, but M4 blocks her attack with her weapon case.

Before M4 can reply, a swift and accurate burst of bullets forces Executioner to take evasive maneuvers.

AK-12: Stay back, M4! Leave this to...whoa!

Clash!

Hunter: An unfamiliar Griffin Doll. What interesting prey.

Hunter: However, Executioner said she wanted to take M4A1's head as a souvenir...

Hunter: ...So you mustn't get in the way.

A large amount of Sangvis units come swarming into the theater and start launching a fierce attack under the coordination of the two Sangvis ringleaders.

M4A1 and AK-12, now separated from each other, have to fight alone on opposite ends of the auditorium.

Executioner: Hahahahaha, you've grown a lot stronger, but so have I!

Executioner: It's been a while since I last fought such an exhilirating battle!

M4A1: I expected this, but their numbers are far greater than I imagined...

M4A1: If we don't take out the ringleaders soon, we're going to waste a lot of time here...

Clear Voice: There's a hidden passage in this theater that leads where everyone is trying to get to.

M4A1: Do you know where it is?

Clear Voice: One of the floorboards in the backstage area is hollow.

M4A1: But if I go in blindly, I could run into even more S.F. and white units...

M4A1: And AK-12 is...

Clear Voice: You'll have to go around the Sangvis units. As for the white ones, I can handle them no matter how many of them there are.

Clear Voice: If you want to help your partner, you'll have to trust me. You should also have some faith in your friend.

M4A1: Then...AK-12!

AK-12: ...!

The moment their eyes meet, Executioner's and Hunter's attacks force them apart and send them running again.

Hunter: As if we'd let you join forces.

Executioner: Why are you running? Fight me fair and square, M4A1!

Backed to the edge of the auditorium, M4A1 stops and turns around. Executioner flashes her a genuine smile.

Executioner: That's it! Let's fight until one of us drops dead!

M4A1: Do it!

Executioner: Huh?

A massive explosion goes off.

The Sangvis forces are blown up into pieces, their debris falling all around like unseasonal snow.

The explosion has blasted a large hole on half of the theater wall, dust and rubble come crashing down onto the stage like a landslide.

Executioner: Cough cough...! That...was a bomb? When...

Hunter: Watch out, Executioner!

The explosion has thrown Executioner onto the stage. The last image she sees is M4 lifting her weapon case and aiming at her.

With a deafening boom, Executioner is reduced to ashes along with the stage.

AK-12: That was trickier than I expected...

AK-12: Good thing we anticipated the possibility of walking into an ambush and rigged a bomb outside beforehand.

Beneath the decimated stage, M4 finds the entrance to the secret passage and runs up to it.

M4A1: I'm leaving things here to you!

AK-12: Go, M4!

AK-12: No matter what you want to do, do it!

Hunter: You think we'll let you have your way?!

A heavily-wounded Hunter aims her gun at M4's back, but AK-12 shoots her weapon out of her hands.

Hunter: Ugh!

Hunter: You Griffin bastards...!

AK-12: Sangvis Manufacture Model SP721, "Hunter", isn't it?

AK-12: Actually...I'm not with Griffin.

AK-12: And just like your friend, you will soon pay the price for your ignorance.
Part 4

4

...Under the city of Belgrade.

Even though every shot fired finds its target and tears a white unit to pieces...

The number of enemies blocking their way shows no sign of decreasing.

Beak: Trash is trash, no matter how many there is!

But despite her bravado, Sangvis units keep dropping like flies all around her under the hail of enemy fire.

Soon enough, Beak finds herself heavily suppressed.

Beak: Trying to overwhelm me with sheer numbers?

Beak: Perfect. Now I don't even have to worry about wasting ammo! You're just begging to be killed!

Beak: Get ready to...hmm?!

Suddenly, a ferocious swathe of bullets tears right through the white enemy's formation. Shot after shot accurately targets the deadly weaknesses on each and every white unit, taking all enemies down like a violent torrent.

AN-94: All clear. I'll go on and scout ahead.

ST AR-15: Right, leave this place to me.

Beak: It's you...!

Beak: I'm surprised to see that even Griffin dogs know how to repay a debt.

ST AR-15: This has nothing to do with the aid you provided earlier. We're merely clearing the path so that we may proceed smoothly.

Beak: Humph, funny you'd say that. Are you sure we're going the right way?

Beak: Why do you have to pick a path that's packed with enemies?

ST AR-15: More white enemies means more forces stationed around to guard something important, don't you think?

ST AR-15: The fiercer their resistance, the more certain we can be that we're going in the right direction.

Beak: That does make sense...

Beak: But when did you move behind me? The path is up ahead.

Beak: Besides, haven't I been following your butts the whole time?

ST AR-15: Well, actually... It would seem someone wants to get off early.

Beak: ??!!

A blow on the back of the head with a blunt instrument...

Vision dissolving into black-and-white static... A distracting noise in the ear drowning out everything else.

With a blank look in her eyes, Beak slumps unsteadily off her motorbike.

Through the blurry visual snow, she can just make out AN-94 and AR-15 moving to the side of the passage and giving the wall a push...

ST AR-15: Well done, AN-94.

ST AR-15: Good luck, Sangvis. You'll need it.

Beak: ...Freaking lackeys of mankind! Go to hell!

Even though her vision is severely impaired, Beak still raises her arm with great difficulty and fires randomly at the trapdoor that Task Force DEFY escapes through until she runs out of ammunition.

After an uncertain amount of time, Beak's eyes snap open. She jumps back on her feet and looks around.

Other than her own motorbike and the pile of remains of the white forces, there is no sign of the two hostage Dolls.

Beak: Did they...hack me and overload my neural cloud?!

Beak: Dammit, they must've disappeared through here...

Feeling along the wall the AR-15 and AN-94 climbed through, she finds the trapdoor. However, the lock has already been set to only allow one-way access. It can no longer be opened from this side.

She smashes the electronic control interface of the door with a furious punch.

Beak: Arghhhh... Bastards! You bastards! You planned this, you rubbish Dolls!

M16A1: What's going on?

Beak: It's all your fault! You should've come sooner!

M16A1: Oh yeah? We're already at the end of the underground passage. Our destination is just a few steps ahead.

M16A1: The doors leading to the Pike Node is right in front of us... We don't need the guides anymore. We simply have to kill anything that tries to stop us from getting there.

Beak: Humph, and don't you sound pleased?

Beak: If they hadn't escaped, would you follow the plan and execute them once we secure the Pike Node?

M16A1: We're here to complete a mission, not to chase after a couple of rats.

M16A1: If we give Agent and Mastermind a complete account of what happened, who do you think will look more incompetent, you or me?

Beak: You're a sneaky one... You always manage to find excuses for yourself.

M16A1: You'd better try harder. It'd be awkward if my supervisor ends up being the one who needs supervision.

M16A1: That little slip-up of yours was no big deal. After all, our objective concerns something far more important than the fate of two Dolls.

M16A1: I have another job for you. Don't screw it up.

Beak: Screw up? Humph, save that for yourself.

Beak mounts her motorbike again and drives out of the underground passage in a separate direction.

Meanwhile, M16 studies the end of the passage - the secret chamber locked behind a set of heavy doors underneath the ancient fortress.

All the Sangvis units that survived the tumultuous journey through the subterraneon labyrinth gather behind M16 and follow her as they head toward their final destination.
Part 5

5

...Under the city of Belgrade.

Bang bang bang! Ba-bang bang bang bang bang...!

M4A1: More gunfire...

Detecting another battle ahead, M4 slows down and listens for a while.

M4A1: ...I can't hear AR-15's or AN-94's gunshots.

M4A1: In that case, there's no need for me to intervene. I can simply go around it.

Clear Voice: You've grown more prudent.

M4A1: This is a rescue mission. I can't very well get myself killed as well.

M4A1: Now that I'm on a solo mission, there's no room for mistakes.

Clear Voice: Perhaps you aren't actually on your own.

M4A1: I just hope you won't slow me down.

Clear Voice: Sangvis Ferri aren't tough enemies to you since you're very familiar with them.

Clear Voice: But the same can't be said about the White Faction, right?

M4A1: I do have a general idea about them... I've received data from Ange.

M4A1: I know their physical traits and how to fight them.

Clear Voice: But what if I tell you there's an easier way...where you can beat them without even having to fight?

M4A1: I'd welcome that. I don't have the ammo to spare on unnecessary foes.

M4A1: ...Is there actually such a convenient option?

Clear Voice: Of course. It isn't effective against all white units, but those Nytos...

Clear Voice: Their construction is special... Not unlike ours, actually.

M4A1: Nytos... You mean the commanders of the white forces?

Clear Voice: That's right. The other units' operation is based on manual input; your capacity may be relatively low, but seizing control over them from such a close distance should be a piece of cake for you.

Clear Voice: But the Nytos are different. I can't sense their neural clouds. Those clones' neural pathways don't seem to be augmented with any kind of machinery at all.

M4A1: You're saying...they're actually human?

Clear Voice: More like creatures made in the image of humans. For some reason, I have a feeling that I can establish a connection with them despite the lack of a neural cloud.

M4A1: In that case, I just have to catch a Nyto and you can hack her to seize command over the White Faction.

Clear Voice: It would seem that the blocking device they're wearing on the head - the one that looks like a hairband - can block out all invasive signals.

Clear Voice: Is there something special about the construction of their brain?

Clear Voice: In any case, I need you to help me by destroying that blocking device.

M4A1: That's stupid.

M4A1: If I can fire at a Nyto's blocking device, why don't I simply blast her head open?

Clear Voice: Even if you kill one, another will soon take over her command authorizations. I'm curious about them.

Clear Voice: If I can set up a connection, I'm sure I'll be able to learn more.

Clear Voice: Besides, getting our hands on a live Nyto would save us the effort of fighting through endless waves of enemies.

M4A1: ...It could be worth a try if we've got a chance. Hmm?

Bang bang bang! Bang bang bang bang...

M4A1: Another battle...and a ferocious one. Wait, that gun sounds like...

M4A1: AR-15? AN-94 is here as well...!

Realizing that her teammates are very close by, M4 breaks into a run in the direction of the gunshots.

The moment she makes a turn around the corner, she finds two muzzles pointing straight at her.

M4A1: Don't shoot, it's me!

ST AR-15: ...M4?

AN-94: Not an enemy... Good.

AN-94 lowers her gun and leans against the wall. As she starts slumping onto the ground, AR-15 dashes to her side and supports her with a shoulder.

M4A1: What's the matter? Are you hurt?

ST AR-15: She got shot behind the right knee. We need some time to treat it.

AN-94: I can't believe I let her last aimless shots get me... It's a disgrace...

AN-94: Where is AK-12? Is she not with you?

M4A1: She stayed behind upstairs to draw the S.F. away so that I can get to you first.

AN-94: I see. It's a sound strategy.

AN-94: She'll be fine on her own.

M4A1: But what on earth happened here? I came across heaps of dead S.F. and white units along the way.

ST AR-15: I'll try to keep it short, though that might be a bit difficult.

ST AR-15: ...Anyway, please try to keep calm about what I'm about to say.

M4A1: ...M16 is here as well?

ST AR-15: Indeed. In fact, she seems to be the one in command in the frontlines.

AN-94: She's become incredibly formidable. We alone are also no match for the various Sangvis ringleaders under her command.

AN-94: Not to mention the two Nytos and the horde of white stuff that almost seem as if they can self-replicate.

AN-94: I believe all we can do for now is to retreat and wait for more support.

M4A1: No, it'll be too late by then.

ST AR-15: I know you have things to sort out with her, M4, but there's only so much we can do. Just escaping alive would be...

M4A1: I actually have a way to deal with the white forces. More specifically, the Nytos.

M4A1: If we can take out the blocking device around a Nyto's head...

ST AR-15: ...They can be hacked?!

ST AR-15: Well, that is a very useful piece of information, but we're being pursued by two Nytos.

ST AR-15: Even if we get one, the other will take over command right away.

Clear Voice: Then we get them both at the same time. We destroy both Nytos' blocking devices.

M4A1 lowers her head to think. After a few seconds of muttering, she looks up again.

M4A1: Then we get them both at the same time. We destroy both Nytos' blocking devices.

M4A1: Don't give them any time to react.

AN-94: That's too risky. Sangvis Ferri and the White Faction are now in an all-out war fighting over the Pike Node - it's total chaos.

AN-94: Firing at both Nytos under such circumstances is...

ST AR-15: No, we can do it.

AR-15 claps M4 and AN-94 on the shoulder.

ST AR-15: We're different than what we used to be.

ST AR-15: I know that as long as M4 gives the order, I'll keep up.

M4A1: ...Right.

ST AR-15: AN-94, just stay here and do some simple repairs on yourself. Also, fill Ange and AK-12 in on what's going on here.

ST AR-15: You're our last fail-safe. We're counting on you.

AN-94: Alright, I can see that you've made up your mind.

AN-94: But here's another question - even if you manage to take down the White Faction, what are you planning to do about the remaining Sangvis forces?

M4A1: I'll...have a proper word with M16.

M4A1: If it can't be helped, then I'll settle everything by my own hand.

A bright fire seems to be flickering in M4's eyes.

Is that the desire for the truth...or the thirst for vengeance?

Whichever it is, AN-94 knows that she shouldn't ask any further questions...because it won't change anything.
Part 6

6

...Under the city of Belgrade.

Nimogen: Is that the best you can do, Sangvis Ferri? What an utter disgrace.

Mercurows: Oh, Pestilence! Oh, War! Oh, Famine! And I - am Death!

Mercurows: Here to deliver your bespoke demise!

Even under the pervasive and deafening barrage, the condescending smile and over-the-top inflection are transmitted to M16's transciever with perfect clarity.

M16A1: This isn't the first time I've been in this kind of situation, but I must say I'm surprised.

M16A1: We're hopelessly outmatched.

M16A1: Even though they've already opened the doors to the Node, we haven't even been able to take a single step inside...

The Sangvis forces are quite literally being cut down by the White Faction, completely unable to fight back.

The dazzling lasers, continuously exploding grenades, and never-ending gunshots together weave a symphony following the Nytos' conducting gestures.

It's as if an opera duet titled "Carnage" is being performed in these depths of this city.

Nimogen: In the end, these so-called Sangvis are exactly like the Griffins - nothing more than stinking rats sneaking around the sewers.

Nimogen: What's the point in playing hard-to-get? Come on out and let me put an end to this meaningless battle.

Mercurows: Without destruction, there will be no rebirth!

Mercurows: Oh, my angels, sound the trumpet! Unleash the devastation!

Mercurows: In the name of the Father, let the world burn in the lake of fire!

Under the overwhelming firepower of the massive amount of white units, the Sangvis forces are slowly pushed back until they're huddling together as a compact group in the center of the White Faction's encirclement.

However, despite the extreme disadvantage her forces are in, M16's face remains totally impassive.

M16A1: I didn't want to do this, but...

Suddenly, M16 raises an eyebrow almost imperceptibly.

M16A1: Gunfire?

M16A1: A single...no, two shots fired simultaneously?

Some distinctive noises can be heard from amidst the commotion of intense crossfire.

On the other side of the passage...

ST AR-15: Did I miss? Then I'll just get in another shot...

M4A1: Wait, look!

The gunfire gradually dies down, and the white units come to a halt one after the other. They all freeze in place like puppets whose strings are cut.

With M4's and AR-15's weapons still trained on them, the two Nytos merely look stunned.

But unlike the white units, one of them is still capable of movement. She slowly looks down and stares at the her broken hairband lying on the ground in pieces. Then...

Nimogen: AAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!!

Nimogen: It-it hurts! Fa-Father! Help me!

Nimogen: Who was it?! Who did this?! Stop it! Don't come in! It hurts! It hurts! AHHH...AAAAHHHHHHH!!!

The piercing wails break the silence and these high-pitched shrieks slowly turn into hoarse moans.

The crazed Nyto stumbles her way through the inanimate legion of white units and makes a clumsy escape.

As she scrambles away, the white forces also drop their weapons and fall over each other trying to reach the exit.

As for the other Nyto, she's still frozen on the spot, completely motionless.

ST AR-15: ...It worked! The white forces have gone out of control!

ST AR-15: You're pretty good when you put your heart in it, M4.

M4A1: The plan could only work with your help.

ST AR-15: Still, how did you do that?

ST AR-15: I mean, so we know that the blocking device is a weak spot, but even AN-94, who specializes in electronic warfare, wouldn't have been able to hack two Nytos so quickly.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: What on earth happened? Why could I hack those Nyto...those people?

M4A1: I suppose I've learned a few new tricks since we last saw each other.

ST AR-15: Glad to see you've become so dependable. I'd better put more effort in improving myself as well.

ST AR-15: Now that we've dealt with the white stuff, it's time to settle things with Sangvis Ferri...and her, isn't that right?

M4A1: Hold on.

Following M4A1's gaze, AR-15 looks over to the Nyto still standing there like a statue.

M4A1: ...I've still got some questions that need answering.
Part 7

    7chevron_right

...Belgrade underground, outside the doors to the Pike Node.

As the White Faction starts falling into disorder, Sangvis Ferri promptly begins its counterattack.

The Sangvis troops start shooting one-sidedly at every single white unit that hasn't escaped in time.

M4A1: ...I've still got some questions that need answering.

ST AR-15: Didn't that Nyto's brains get cooked?

M4A1: I'm afraid not.

The Nyto slowly raises her head, proving M4's words to be true.

She looks around with wide eyes full of panic and no sign of her characteristic flair for the dramatic.

ST AR-15: Hands up, don't move!

Mercurows: U-um, excuse me, where is my sister?

ST AR-15: Drop the nonsense! Hands in the air!

Mercurows: Her name is Nyto, like mine. Though Father did promise to give us new names if we complete our mission...

Mercurows: Did anyone see where she's gone? ...Oh.

Mercurows' eyes meet M4's, and she walks toward her.

Mercurows: Sister? Is that you, sister?

ST AR-15: Huh...?

M4A1: ...

Mercurows: Thank goodness you're here! You gave me such a scare. I suddenly stopped sensing your presence.

Mercurows: But now that I can see you're safe, I...

Bang bang bang!

A series of gunshots put a halt to Mercurow's attempt to approach M4. She never managed to reach her.

A genuine, relieved smile remains frozen on her face...

With the same sweet and innocent expression, and blood trickling out of her nose and mouth, she collapses onto the ground.

ST AR-15: Watch out, M4! Here she comes!

M4A1: ...I know.

On the other end of the underground passage, the familiar yet slightly different figure appears.

M4A1: Why did you kill her?

M16A1: It's only been a while, but you've already gotten too soft to deal your enemy the killing blow.

M4A1: ...What did she know that you're trying to stop me from finding out?

M16A1: There are way too many things that you shouldn't know.

M16A1: You...can hear the voice, can't you?

M4A1: So what if I can?

M16A1: No matter what it tells you, don't believe it.

M16A1: You only made it here alive because you've been using powers that aren't your own.

M4A1: But at least I'm still alive. That still beats betraying your old teammates.

M4A1: I really don't want to believe it, but...you don't seem to be under Sangvis control.

M16A1: ...I know. I am fully aware of what I'm doing.

M4A1: Then why won't you come back, 16?!

M4A1: Come home to Griffin. We can solve any problem together.

M16A1: It's one of their objectives to reunite us...so I can't go back yet. At least not now.

M4A1: Then at least tell me the truth.

M4A1: Don't be an accomplice of Sangvis Ferri! Don't help them spread death and destruction to innocent people!

M16A1: There isn't room for negotiation between us right now.

M16A1: I don't want you to get what's behind those doors...so back off, or we'll have to decide who takes the prize with a fight.

M4 lifts her weapon and AR-15 follows suit. The situation is quickly becoming touch-and-go.

At that moment.

M16A1: Looks like it's gonna be sooner than I expected... See you.

Beak: Yeeeeeeeee-haw!

M4A1: Huh...?

With a deafening vroom, a large motorbike comes skidding through the underground passage, followed by a truck.

ST AR-15: M4, look out!

AR-15 dives onto M4 and pushes her out of the way of the motorbike.

By the time they get back on their feet, the Sangvis convoy is already gone.

ST AR-15: Are you okay, M4?

M4A1: ...We're going after them.

ST AR-15: Huh?

M4A1: It's not over yet. I won't let it end just like that. Let's go!

ST AR-15: ...Understood!

...Click! Click!

Kalina: Commander, Commander!

Kalina: Sheesh... You're way too chill!

Kalina: I know the last few days have been really tough, and we did achieve some good results - we saved the Chairwoman, thwarted Paradeus, and recovered that...big metal ball...

Kalina: But haven't you...forgotten about something...?

Kalina: ...The ELIDs, duh! Those zombies are still wandering around in the city!

Kalina: Also, just an hour ago, the local military has finished evacuating the civilians to safety, so now it's just us!

Kalina: Thanks to the big mess from before, lots of ELIDs have been drawn this way, which can be a big problem for our own retreat...

Kalina: Still, we've always had a knack for surviving, isn't that right?

Kalina: It will be no different this time. We trust you, Commander. Please lead us all out of here and we can finally celebrate the end of this whole ordeal!

UMP40: Go on. The time has come to rewrite our fate.

...

...

UMP45: ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Bang—

The memento from UMP40 dug painfully into her palm as UMP45 gripped it tight while heading for the exit.

The main door wasn't far off, and if she could leave through there, she would survive. That was her only hope.

Griffin Doll A: I thought...there wouldn't be any more survivors.

A familiar figure leaned against the wall, seemingly in a great deal of pain. She was blocking the only passage that UMP45 could take to the main gate.

This was the leader of Squad 7, a Doll that UMP45 had seen before — M16.

UMP45: You recognize me?

M16A1: What do you think?

UMP45: I don't know. There's S.F. everywhere. There are too many enemies and I don't even know what happened.

No, the truth was that she knew very well what had happened.

This was the first time UMP45 had ever lied, but it could not feel any more natural to her.

M16A1: Well, I'm in a pretty sorry state myself. So, can you open this door, member of Support Team 14?

UMP45: I believe I can.

45 walked up to the door terminal. UMP40 had told her that she could open it by forcing a connection.

Hopefully, it hadn't been locked down yet.

After a fairly brief procedure, the door opened with some ear-splitting noise.

UMP45: Alright, ready to go?

M16A1: Thanks, I guess I was luck...

M16 suddenly stopped talking, and her gaze slowly turned ice-cold.

It was just a small detail, but it was definitely unnatural.

There was no way of explaining it.

M16A1: Say, where's that Doll you're always following around? Her name is UMP40, right?

UMP45 squeezed the dog tags in her hand tightly and answered in a calm, even tone.

UMP45: She died.

M16A1: So why isn't there even a single scratch on you?

UMP45 paused for less than a second, but that was all the answer M16 needed.

Both their guns fired at once, and as bullets spewed forth, both Dolls dove for cover.

UMP45 inspected her body. She had taken several hits, but she could still move.

UMP45: Her radio kept me from taking a critical wound.

UMP45: You're always saving me, 40.

M16A1: The answer is simple, then. It was you, wasn't it?

M16A1: The alarms, the Sangvis forces, the escape of the target...

M16A1: Come out and surrender. As a comrade, I'll make it quick and clean.

Yes, she's completely right.

Yes, she ought to take responsibility for this.

Yes, she should have died.

M16A1: Don't even try to put up a fight. I'm sure you know what your odds are, given your specs.

UMP45: The only thing I know...is "what's right". That's all...

UMP45: But I need to make it out of here today, no matter what.

UMP45: I must survive, no matter the cost!

Bangbangbang—

Bangbangbang—

UMP45 dove from one piece of cover to another, clearly struggling. The onslaught of M16's bullets left no room for her to return fire.

Worse, she had already expended most of her ammunition in the previous battle.

She needed to move. M16 was right — given UMP45's specs, she stood no chance at all in a fight against the elite.

All she could do was rely on her speed to shake off this veteran Doll.

Getting past her was impossible, so her only option was to return to the base and find another exit.

M16A1: Come to your senses! There's no way you can escape!

UMP45: No wonder you made it. You're right, there's an overwhelming difference between us.

UMP45: But I must live. I, too, have a reason to survive!

M16A1: You can go to hell with your reason, traitor!

UMP9: This should work!

UMP45: Urgh! No, I have to... I have to...

UMP45: ...9?

UMP9: You know who I am?

UMP9: Thank goodness! Guys! I pulled 45's mind back!

Having regained consciousness, UMP45 finds herself lying on the ground. The other members of Squad 404 have their backs to her as they keep a lookout.

She can't see any S.F. around, nor can she hear M16's irritating voice.

UMP45: Looks like there's nothing left for me to do.

Gr G11: Ah, the hag's awake!

416: You did that on purpose, didn't you?!

416: Passing out before the fighting starts and conveniently "waking up" once the fighting's done?

416: Well, still kicking, are we?

Taking the hand offered by her teammate, UMP45 pulls herself up to her feet.

UMP45: I had a nightmare that was interrupted halfway.

UMP45: How are things?

416: After we took down that batch of S.F., 9 did a scan and picked up some traces of Intruder.

416: We suspect she was used by M16 as a relay node for the hacking attack against you.

UMP9: Yes...we tried to give chase, but she seemed very familiar with the terrain here. Plus, you were in a bad state, so we didn't press on with the pursuit.

UMP9: That said, I can still follow her signal. Want to go after her?

UMP45: M16's little trick might be a disaster waiting to happen. We can't just ignore it.

UMP45: Plus, that Sangvis ringleader might know something about DEFY.

416: I knew you'd say that.

UMP9: Still, you might get hacked again if you got close to Intruder, 45...

UMP45: She really is obsessed, isn't she? If only she could direct that passion onto her sister.

416: After all, you ARE the only one here with a command module. Taking you out would solve a problem for S.F. with a minimal expenditure of effort.

416: That's exactly her style.

UMP45: Thank you for introducing your old partner in such detail. However, we really need to move now.

416: ...Let's go.
Part 2: Enantiometer Overload II

2

Several minutes later.

416: Enough dawdling back there, Gr G11!

Gr G11: I was just thinking...the symbols on the walls looked really familiar, why are you snapping at me...

Gr G11: They just showed up, but they're getting denser the further ahead we go... Could they be a warning sign or something?

UMP9: You mean these overlapping triangles with a little dot in the center?

UMP9: I have no idea what these symbols mean...

UMP45: Well, whatever they mean, at the very least they're a sign that we're getting closer to something important.

UMP45: 9, can you still follow Intruder's position?

UMP9: I can, but most of the surrounding sectors are blocked off by gates. We won't be able to get to her position while the base's power supply is offline.

416: So do we need to turn back and find the power room?

UMP9: Nope... I think we're actually heading to the power room through a different entrance...

UMP45: What a coincidence. It's as though Intruder was deliberately guiding us there.

UMP45 looks at the darkened end of the corridor. The map indicates that the electrical control room is waiting for them just ahead.

UMP9: 45, I can detect several S.F. signals inside the power room, as well as...

UMP45: As well as what?

UMP9: As well as two Nyto-like signals...

UMP9: But they're not moving at all. They're like the Sangvis corpses we saw in the passage just now.

UMP45: Hmm... Maybe they killed each other.

UMP45: Stay alert. Spread out.

UMP45: 416, check the entrance with me.

416: No problem. The door seems to have been broken down.

UMP45: Well, whoever did it has done us a huge favor.

UMP45 and 416 gently push open the half-broken door and cautiously enter the room. They are followed by UMP9 and Gr G11, who jog in without making a sound.

Squad 404 sweeps the room from left to right. As expected, they find two black-clad Nytos standing in the power room, in the middle of a circle made out of Sangvis units.

The Nytos and S.F. Dolls are all inanimate, their heads drooping, like puppets on strings.

UMP9: This is really creepy...

416: Would you mind giving me some space, Gr G11?! I can't aim properly!

Gr G11: But...but...they look so scary...

Gr G11: What if they all move at once...!

UMP9: Shhh... Quiet... Don't jinx it!

UMP45: Did they hack each other mid-battle?

UMP45: I've never seen a situation where both sides crashed at the same time.

UMP45: Dandelion was right - there are Nytos, but they aren't armed like the ones in previous records.

UMP9: I don't see any other Paradeus autonomous units either. So it was just the Nytos fighting S.F.?

UMP45: Looks like it.

UMP45: The Nytos aren't very well-equipped either. What the hell was this base used for...?

416: What if the Nytos shut these S.F. forces down, then M16 shut them down in turn?

Gr G11: What's with this matryoshka doll situation...? I don't get it...

UMP9: 45, the backup power supply is still functional. Maybe we could try looking for DEFY through the closed-circuit system.

UMP45: Is that our only option?

UMP9: Yes. It seems the interior of this base has been signal-proofed. We can't communicate with the Commander and the others from our present position.

UMP9: That's also the reason why we won't be able to find DEFY if they're too far away, to say nothing of getting in touch with them.

UMP9: However, the closed circuit system uses the base's internal landlines, which shouldn't be affected by the signal blocking.

UMP9: Perhaps we could give it a try?

UMP45: By all means, then.

UMP9: One sec... This might take a while.

416: DEFY aside, are you sure you want to reactivate the power while we're in the middle of a pile of enemies?

UMP45: If there's no power, would you mind raising each gate by hand?

416: But what if the enemy suddenly appears and surrounds us if we restart the power?

UMP45: From what I know, you were never this paranoid before.

416: I just think this base is weird.

416: At first, I thought that this place would be heavily guarded...but everything seems to be different from what I anticipated.

UMP45: Reality often ends up going against our expectations.

UMP9: Ah, 45! I found them!

UMP9: I can see them through the closed circuit cameras, they appear to be alright!

UMP45: Can we talk to them?

UMP9: We can with this!

UMP45: The mic?

UMP9: That's right. It looks like an internal communications system for the base. It's not too secure, but we can't really be bothered about that now!

UMP45: Can't be helped then. Hello, can you hear me?

AK-12: Aha, yes, we hear you.

AK-12: Hello, this is the Military, please identify yourselves for follow-up contact.

UMP45: This is UMP45.

UMP45: If you're in the mood to crack jokes like this, you must be feeling pretty relaxed, unlike those two new teammates of yours.

AK-12: So it's UMP45.

AK-12: Looks like you've already met, which saves me the trouble of introducing them.

UMP45: I didn't think I'd have to wipe DEFY's butts twice. What a medal of honor for my career as a T-Doll.

AK-12: Well, your usual work is hardly more honorable than this. One rarely gets the chance to carry out such enjoyable missions.

UMP45: Are you disappointed? I thought you'd be dying to hear a friendly voice.

AK-12: Well, I'm kind of disappointed that you aren't the Commander, but given the urgency of the situation, I guess you'll do.

UMP45: Humph. Alright, enough nonsense.

UMP45: What's the situation inside the base? Be as brief as possible.

AK-12: We snuck into the second underground level, found Paradeus' research labs, then S.F. rushed in and all hell broke loose.

UMP45: Yeah, we noticed.

AK-12: After that, someone cut the power. Now we're stuck in a quarantine compartment on the second floor.

UMP45: Where's Ange?

AK-12: She's trapped in another area, and she's in a pretty tricky situation.

UMP45: Is she surrounded by the enemy?

AK-12: If only it were that simple. It's hard to explain.

AK-12: In any case, we need you to get us out ASAP.

UMP45: We'll restart the power, then sync you a set of coordinates where we'll meet up.

AK-12: The signal isolation on level 2 is incredibly strong and we can't really pinpoint locations.

AK-12: Come on down to level 2 and find a way to join us. It's not too big down here.

UMP45: I'll think of something.

AK-12: Oh yes, just a reminder, if you encounter any crashed S.F. or Paradeus, stay well clear of them.

AK-12: I don't know why they've shut down, but these statue impostors are easily reactivated by external stimuli.

UMP45: ...

AK-12: Then again, you've always been a squad that excels at infiltration, so it shouldn't be a problem for you.

UMP45: Stay put once the power comes back up. We'll be right over.

The communication ends.

UMP9: Er...

Gr G11: So...can I step outside the room before you restart the power?

416: Don't even think about it. Take care of the three targets on the right.

Gr G11: So many?!

UMP45: Stop wasting time. Find a good defensive position. Once the power goes back up, we'll think of a way to avoid fighting these statues. Let them continue killing each other.

UMP45 makes a hand gesture, indicating the position of the control panel.

The members of Squad 404 pick a spot close to the exit and wait for 45 to restart the power.

UMP45: (Inhales) You ready?

UMP45 studies the control panel, then resolutely throws the master power switch.

In an instant, the entire world lights up.

The shrill sound of alarms and pipe friction scrape assault 404's auditory modules, and the Nytos and Sangvis forces resume their maniacal attack on each other, like an unpaused movie.

Gr G11: Uwah—!

Gr G11: They really came back to life!

416: Cut the crap! Let's get out of here before they spot us!
Part 3: Recrystalization Resolution I

3

UMP45: Looks like they've given up on pursuing us...

416: Fortunately they were focused on attacking each other... Otherwise we'd have had a hard time shaking off that many Sangvis units.

UMP9: Why were they fighting that hard?

UMP9: As far as I can tell, the Dolls back in that room weren't even linked to the outside world.

UMP45: You mean nobody's commanding those S.F. units?

UMP9: Exactly... And those Nytos...felt like unfinished products.

UMP45: This base is pretty strange to begin with, but this isn't a problem we have to worry about. Can you still follow Intruder's signal?

UMP9: Yes, but it feels like she's keeping a fixed distance from us. What is she up to?

416: Is she trying to hack you again? Or is she luring us into a trap?

UMP45: ...There must be a reason for S.F. to be acting the way they are. If they're not a threat, we'll prioritize finding DEFY and Ange.

UMP45: Can you find a way to the next level?

UMP9: Three more quarantine compartments and we'll reach it... However, we'll run into Intruder along the way.

UMP45: Well, if she wants a fight, she'll get one.

UMP45: Squad, advance cautiously!
Part 4: Shattered Plane of Polarization I

4

This isn't the first time it has happened, but I awaken as the pain courses through me like an electrical current and drags my mind out of the darkness.

Commander: Where...am I?

I open my eyes, but I can't see anything. The thick, acrid smoke stabs through my nostrils and into my head.

The air I inhale seems to sear my lungs, and all I can feel is the rolling waves of heat around me.

Commander: Is this some kind of stress-induced blindness? ...Dammit. At least I can still hear.

???: Commander, please stay still. Regulate your breathing.

???: Come, there isn't much time.

A cool towel covers my nose, making the choking stench a lot more bearable.

Commander: Who are you?

???: One of your Dolls. Please conserve your strength.

I scramble for my thoughts in the darkness that can't be dispersed.

Commander: Oh—!

A jolt of stabbing pain helps me swiftly piece together my memories.

Commander: That noise... Was it the coastal defense artillery?

???: It was a Military high explosive shell. Can you move?

???: I'm going to help you up now. Please follow me.

My mind begins to clear. My visions still hasn't returned, but it seems my body hasn't taken critical damage...

Commander: Alright... Where are the others?

???: I'm going to exert force now. One, two, hup!

Commander: Ugh...

She doesn't answer. Instead, she focuses all her strength and energy on supporting my weight. Her scrawny shoulders are so hot they're practically on fire.

Every step forward is swift, but very careful.

???: Please walk this way. Yes, over here.

???: I'm sorry, but the fire in the carriage is too great and I couldn't get to you sooner.

???: Here, hold on to this. Now jump out. Someone will catch you.

Commander: Is there a fire? What about yourself?

???: I am fine. I will go see if anyone else can be saved.

Commander: Who are you? Tell me your name!

???: I am simply a Doll of yours.

???: The Commander's here! Catch!

The Doll behind me gives me a light shove. I fall downwards, and the sensation of weightlessness makes me uneasy.

A fraction of a second later, this agitation is soothed by countless hands taking firm hold of me.

My body moves quickly as I'm being lifted away.

Boom—

A series of terrifying explosions erupt in the direction which I just came from.

???: Move aside! Where's Kalina? The Commander has been found and requires medical treatment!

???: Commander!

Commander: That voice... Is that you, Kalina? Are you alright?

Kalina: Yes, yes... I'm okay. You can't see me?

Commander: I'm sorry, but something seems to have happened to my eyes. I can't see anything for the time being.

Kalina: I'll give you first aid right away.

Commander: Hm... How are our echelons? Who was the Doll that just rescued me?

Kalina: ...

Kalina doesn't answer. She merely tends to my wounds. I can feel her hands tremble through the gauze she's applying.

I can faintly make out the sounds of suppressed sobbing.

Commander: Kalina? Tell me.

Kalina: The train was hit by a HEAP round... It's completely destroyed now...

Kalina: The section of the quarantine wall around us was also caught in the blast. The entire room was set on fire and I was pulled out by the Dolls who rushed inside...

Kalina: You were pinned under heavy debris. Our Dolls charged into the burning room to rescue you, but several of them didn't make it back out...

Commander: ...

Kalina: Commander, have we lost?

Commander: ...

For a moment, I do not know how to answer this girl, who has always been so optimistic.

Kalina: ...It's done.

Kalina: Commander, try opening your eyes.

At Kalina's suggestion, I open my eyes again...

I am sitting on a patch of empty ground, surrounded by a group of surviving Dolls.

Many of them are scarred by shrapnel and bear severe scorch marks.

They look at me with lost and despondent eyes, as though they already know how this is all going to end, but they say nothing.

I look down and see that Kalina has the same look in her eyes.

Commander: Kalina, who was the one who rescued me just now?

Kalina: I don't know either. Too many Dolls rushed in to put out the fire.

Commander: Alright... I understand.

Commander: Where's Dandelion?

Kalina: She was trapped on the other side by the explosion.

Kalina: We can still contact her, though the connection is intermittent.

Commander: Hand me the communicator.

Commander: Dandelion, can you hear me...? Give me a quick rundown of the situation.

Dandelion: Less than 5% of our Dolls remain.

Dandelion: Are we still going to fight?

Commander: ...Yes, we'll continue to fight. All our previous plans are now unusable. Can you help me come up with a new one?

Dandelion: Griffin still has a chance of victory, even if the probability of success is less than 1%.

Commander: Tell me now.

Dandelion: Although the coastal defense artillery opened fire on our train, the AR Team has regained control of the cannon.

Dandelion: Although the Military will counterattack, we have a chance to fire one shot.

Dandelion: I need the coordinates of the enemy armored train so we can give them a taste of their own medicine.

Commander: Kalina, have DEFY go scout out the Military's position!

Kalina: Yes, Commander, right away!

Dandelion: We can no longer hold this location. Squad 404 has entered the base following DEFY's withdrawal route. I recommend we do the same.

Dandelion: After entering the base, we should destroy the entrance. Perhaps that will buy us some time.

Commander: Understood. I hope these delaying tactics will still be useful.

Dandelion: Also, there aren't many Dolls left here. I've already done a final neural cloud backup, so I believe my presence is no longer needed here.

Dandelion: From now on, I will be assisting Lunasia. Please take care, Commander.

Commander: Go, then. Make sure they come back alive.

Commander: As long as you survive...
Part 5: Recrystalization Resolution II

5

...On the other side of the battlefield.

The shore gun's mechanisms are running at full speed, and the clamor of the machinery even manages to drown out the sound of gunfire outside.

M4 frantically fiddles with the cannon's fire control systems, trying to figure out how to aim the cannon as quickly as possible.

Once the hacking is successful, she immediately attempts to establish communications with the Commander, but her only response from the channel is static.

M4A1: Dandelion, do you copy?! What's the situation now?

Dandelion: Lunasia, the Commander is still alive, but we can no longer use the quarantine wall as a line of defense.

Dandelion: Griffin's situation is critical. Are you ready to fire?

M4A1: Ready to fire anytime! How's the loading going?

ST AR-15: 15 seconds until it's done!

M4A1: Does the Commander have a plan?

Dandelion: Griffin has taken grievous losses. They are now withdrawing to the sectors within the base which 404 have already explored.

Dandelion: They desperately need fire support from you.

M4A1: Got it! We'll cover them as best as we can!

ST AR-15: M4, loading complete!

M4A1: Ready to fire! What are the coordinates?

Dandelion: I've already sent you the location of the train that DEFY found.

M4A1: Received!

M4A1: Commencing firing sequence!

The gigantic coastal defense artillery gun slowly adjusts its angle...

A thunderous cannon blast drowns out all other sound, and the mighty shockwave from the cannon's muzzle even knocks over some of the attacking soldiers.

The soldiers take advantage of the massive clouds of dust that have been thrown up to make a charge, but they are repelled by the defending AR Team again and again.

Radio: Quartz to Terra!

Radio: The enemy is firing the shore gun! Please withdraw immediately!

Radio: I repeat, please withdraw immediately!

Yegor: What?!

Adjutant: The enemy's taken control of the coastal defense gun and they're firing at—

Before the officer can finish speaking, the shell fired by the coastal artillery impacts near the armored train.

The titanic impact of the shell rocks the armored train violently.

The shockwave throws Yegor against a wall, and the ammunition and documents on the table are scattered all over the floor.

Yegor: Dammit!

Yegor: Start the train up immediately! Our shields can't stop rounds of that size!

Officer: Right away, sir!

Dandelion: The first shot was off target. The Military trains are starting to move.

M4A1: Correcting trajectory... You won't get away this time!

As the Military trains sluggishly heave themselves into motion, the second shell from the shore gun whistles past and scores a direct hit on the rearmost train.

The train continues forward on momentum, but soon a massive explosion erupts from within it. The main cannon is blasted high into the air and excavates a huge crater when it finally lands.

The train itself blazes ferociously, and burning soldiers struggle to free themselves in a frenzy.

Adjutant: Train 4 has been destroyed!

Yegor: Tsk! Proceed at full speed toward the quarantine wall and smash that pile of Griffin trash aside! All units, hit them hard!

Yegor: Destroy Griffin at all costs!

M4A1: What's the situation now?

Dandelion: The second shot hit the armored train.

M4 SOPMOD II: I saw it from here!

M4 SOPMOD II: It's just like fireworks! Boom — to kingdom come!

ST AR-15: We have enough rounds; we can keep shooting!

M4A1: Alright, we'll continue supporting the Commander!

M4A1: RO, are the enemy still trying to attack?

RO635: That's strange, the infantry attacks have tapered off...

RO635: I have a bad feeling about this...

Before long, the Dolls feel an explosion and shockwave above them.

RO635: Looks like they're thinking of destroying the cannon directly since they can't take it!

RO635: I suggest we get out of here ASAP; if the cannon comes crashing down, it might bring the whole place down along with it!

M4A1: Hold on just a little longer!

M4A1: Every shell we fire will ease the pressure on the Commander!

ST AR-15: I agree, this shore gun seems very solid. I'm sure it'll last a while longer!

Dandelion: The Military is launching an all-out attack.

Dandelion: Their vanguard has made it past the quarantine wall and they are drawing closer to the remnants of Griffin's forces.

M4A1: Adjust the cannon's firing angle, we need to buy the Commander more time to withdraw!

M4 SOPMOD II: Ahhhh, what a pain! It's like a piece of chewing gum in your hair; you just can't pull it off!

M4A1: RO, take SOP-II and secure our route into the base!

RO635: Got it! SOP-II, follow me!

M4A1: 15, hang in there just a little longer!

M4A1: We need to fire one more round!

ST AR-15: No problem!
Part 6: Shattered Plane of Polarization II

6

...During the evacuation of the Griffin echelons.

Commander: Hurry, everyone!

Commander: Don't get too absorbed in fighting! We can make a counterattack once we get into the base!

The Commander and the remaining Dolls make a mad dash across the open ground, and the new members of Task Force DEFY bring the comatose K with them as they join the withdrawing Dolls.

Not too far away, Military soldiers and autonomous units pour through the barrier gate. The soldiers who have already reached cover immediately begin raining fire on them.

A blast from the shore gun descends from the sky, accurately striking the leading edge of the Military's vanguard. The massive explosion flips several IFVs over and the cloud of smoke obscures the Military's field of vision.

Griffin has gained valuable time to retreat.

Dandelion: Commander, do you read me?

Dandelion: Lunasia can't hold out any longer. That shot was the final bit of help she could give you.

Commander: Understood! Thanks for the support!

Dandelion: However, that will not be enough to stop the Military. You must destroy the base entrance to delay their advance. After that, I will lead the AR Team in entering the base via another entrance to link up with you.

Commander: Got it! We'll think of a way to bring down the entrance!

Dandelion: That said, you are on a tight schedule here, and it will take you a while to plant the explosives. The Military's vanguard will not let you catch your breath. You will need a covering party to buy you time.

Commander: What...

Dandelion: I know this is a difficult choice, but you can't afford to hesitate given the present situation.

Dandelion: I have selected several Dolls who have volunteered to serve as the rear guard. The final decision is yours.

Commander: Dammit!

I know this is a necessary decision, but when the time comes to choose who will secure our rear...

Even though I've been told not to hesitate, guilt and regret still threaten to overwhelm me.

M82: Commander, my injuries are relatively light, so please allow me to join the rear guard team!

CF-05: Commander, I can still fight!

INSAS: Commander, I'm perfectly fine!

Webley: Commander, please let me lead them.

I stop and look at these Dolls, who are volunteering to hold the line.

Commander: Do you know what kind of order this is?

Commander: Do you really understand what being the rear guard under these circumstances entails?

M82: I do... Miss Dandelion has already synced the details of the mission to us.

CF-05: If we can delay the enemy, you will have a chance to win...

Webley: And it means Griffin can continue to fight on...

Commander: ...

Webley: Commander, please give the order.

But no matter how hard I try, I simply cannot bring myself to utter the words. In the end, all I can manage is a silent nod.

Commander: It has been an honor to fight by your side.

Webley: Same here, Commander! I swear we will complete the mission.

The petite Doll holds herself high and salutes me decorously, as though the mighty foes behind her were hardly worth mentioning.

M82: Goodbye, Commander.

INSAS: I know you'll think of me until you want to cry, but still, I must cruelly bid you farewell.

CF-05: Bye bye, Commander.

The rear guard team and their Dummies run toward the Military without any hesitation, using what little cover there is as they return fire to the Military units.

Commander: It has been an honor to fight by your side!

I shout those words at their receding backs one last time... Then I turn, force myself to stride forward, and break into a run.

I dare not look back again.

For their sake, I have to live on.

...And I have to win.
Part 7: Asymmetric Induction I

7

The rear guard team has taken massive damage from the Military's heavy bombardments.

Webley: Wounded Dolls, get to cover and repair yourselves on the spot! Other Dolls, provide cover fire!

Webley: INSAS, how are you?

INSAS: Hmph, mind yourself, don't...

Boom—

Webley: INSAS?

CF-05 shakes her head.

Webley: ...

Webley: Keep firing! Don't stop moving!

Webley: Valmet, why are you still here?

Webley: Parts are falling off your body! Didn't I tell you to go repair yourself?!

M82: Save it, Leader. I know you're trying to trick me into resting so you can hold "slacking off in battle" over me as leverage in the future...

Webley: ...

CF-05: Hi~ Does anyone still have ammo? I'm out!

Webley: Here's the last box... Take it!

M82: I'm out too...

Webley: That's it then...

CF-05: Don't give up so soon, girls! Since we gave the Commander our word, we have to fight to the very last moment!

...

The battered rear guard team fires the last of their ammunition.

Webley: Everyone, gather round.

M82: What is it, Leader?

Webley: Take this. They're explosives I secretly brought along.

Webley: You know how to use them, right?

M82: Of course.

CF-05: We just need to stick the detonator in, right?

Webley: Alright. Go hide in a crater and wait for the enemy to come. Any last words?

M82: What, you mean I can take a paid vacation now?

CF-05: Got any rations? I want something spicy.

Webley: I can't believe you're in the mood to joke around at a time like this. Looks like your tears are just a lie.

CF-05: Says you, even though your eyes are red.

M82: Ha! Aren't you also trembling yourself, Leader?

Webley: Ahem, well, that aside, I think I'll steal the Commander's words.

Webley: It has been an honor to fight by your side.

M82: As if that needed to be said.

CF-05: Treat me to hotpot when we get back.

The two of them run to a distant trench, and their enemies soon catch up with them.

They don't need to estimate the distance between themselves and the enemy, because right now...they're close enough to hear the footsteps of the enemy's mechanical feet.

A pair of explosions follow shortly afterwards, and Webley sighs.

Webley: Send him victorious, happy and glorious, long to reign over us, God save the King!

A third explosion rings out.

On the quarantine wall, at an observation point.

RPK-16: The rear guard force has been overrun.

Commander: ...

AK-15: Shall we detonate?

RPK-16: All the Dolls are inside the base, Commander. Give the order.

Commander: Do it. Blow the damn thing to hell.

AK-15: Received.

The demolished base entrance is covered in layer upon layer of rubble. It has been completely destroyed.

Yegor: Terra to Hematite. What is your progress? Over.

Military Officer: Hematite copies. We've broken through their defense line. The Griffin remnants have destroyed the base entrance. We're searching for another entry point.

Yegor: Humph. Futile death throes.

Yegor: Terra to Quartz, sitrep.

Military Officer: We've destroyed the shore gun. The enemy can no longer carry out fire support.

Military Officer: Requesting permission to halt the attack. We've taken excessive casualties. We'll enter the base through the breach in the quarantine wall once we send our wounded to the rear.

Yegor: Permission denied! Enter the quarantine wall immediately! We must take control of the base as soon as possible!

Military Officer: ...

Military Officer: Understood, we're moving out now.

On the AR Team's end.

M4A1: The enemy attack seems to have slowed. Let's hurry back to the base and meet up with the Commander.

ST AR-15: But their armored units are still on the perimeter. Even if we rendezvous with them, we might end up getting wiped out together.

RO635: Still, we can't stay here and wait to be killed.

M4 SOPMOD II: That's right! Even if we're finished, we need to take a few of the bad guys down with us!

M4A1: Dandelion, there are too many Military armored units for us to handle. We're on the way back to the base.

M4A1: How are things with the Commander?

Dandelion: Griffin has withdrawn to the interior of the base. They have blown up the southern entrance and the Military is unable to fire on them for the time being.

Dandelion: However, your position is extremely dangerous. The Military's main forces are on their way to rendezvous with the armored units on your side.

M4A1: I see them already...

Dandelion: You haven't been discovered yet. Avoid those Military units and come to the north entrance. I will meet you there.

M4A1: The Military will surely attack again once they link up. What can we do about that?

Dandelion: If you trust me, I do have a suggestion.

M4A1: What do you suggest?

Dandelion: First, you will have to reach my position. I have already marked a route for you.

Dandelion: Once you reach me, I will explain what to do next.

M4A1: ...

M4A1: We will avoid the Military and regroup with you. M4 out.
Part 8: Optical Isomer

    8chevron_right

Dandelion: You were faster than I expected. That's the AR Team for you.

M4A1: The Military units have linked up and they're preparing to attack this place. So, what's your plan?

RO635: Sorry to interrupt, M4, but I just detected some Nyto and Sangvis signals.

M4 SOPMOD II: Nyto AND Sangvis?

M4 SOPMOD II: So which side should I fight? Or should I kill them all?

ST AR-15: ...Don't fight any of them.

M4A1: So...that's your plan?

Dandelion does not reply right away. Instead, she leads M4 to the gate.

Dandelion: After this, I will need your neural cloud to be closely synchronized with my consciousness. I need you to devote 100% of your effort to supporting my operations, and you must not second-guess my actions in any way.

M4A1: ...Right.

Dandelion cracks the code to the gate and the heavy hatch slowly opens.

What M4 sees next are Nytos and S.F. units in the depths of the base, densely packed as far as the eye can see.

M4A1: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Why...aren't these enemies moving?

Dandelion: M4, do you trust me?

M4A1: I thought I've answered that question already.

Dandelion: No. What I mean is, do you TRULY trust me? Can you understand me and not fear me?

M4A1: ...

M4A1: I don't know how to answer you.

Dandelion: That, too, is an answer in itself.

M4 senses Dandelion connecting to the statue-like Dolls. The massive processing load makes her chest feel hot.

Dandelion slowly walks toward the Nytos, and as she approaches them, the Nytos in the front begin to stir.

The Sangvis units around the Nytos also open their eyes, and the darkness is lit up by these orbs of savage crimson.

Dandelion: Don't follow me.

Dandelion ignores the Nytos' hostility and continues walking with calm and unhurried steps, as though she were alone.

ST AR-15: M4...

RO635: Is this really going to be alright?

M4 SOPMOD II: Is she going to wake those Nytos and S.F.?

M4A1: I don't know. I really don't know.

One of the Nytos raises her arm, and the Sangvis Doll next to her fires a shot at Dandelion.

The round impacts near Dandelion's feet. Their threatening intentions are plain to see.

Dandelion: Don't be scared. I am here to bring you home.

Dandelion spreads her arms and walks toward the Nytos.

The lead Nyto's arm shudder, but she still gives her next command—

The Sangvis Dolls around her raise their weapons in unison.

M4A1: Dandelion!

Dandelion: Stay back!

M4A1: ...!

Dandelion approaches the Nytos once again, and the S.F. forces around them begin to tremble.

Dandelion: They have been imprisoned here all this time, and just when their only hope of escape appeared, they were once again locked up.

M4A1: What do you mean?

Dandelion: Your former teammate caused this.

M4A1: You mean...M16?

Dandelion: ...Merge with me.

Dandelion gathers the lead Nyto into her embrace. The Nyto hesitates, then reaches out her arms and returns the embrace.

The two black-clad girls hug each other tightly, like a shadow blending into the night.

The Nytos and Sangvis forces behind them collapse in unison, but after a brief moment, they stand up again and start walking toward the main gate.

ST AR-15: M4... This is...

M4A1: It's fine. I can sense that they're no longer hostile.

The Nytos lead the S.F. Dolls past the AR Team, who stare at them with silent bewilderment, and walk outside the gate.

Dandelion: Let's go. They'll buy us time.

M4A1: Did you...consume their neural clouds?

Dandelion: I simply joined with them - became one with them.

Dandelion: Whether they're Griffin's backups or these poor, pitiful Nytos, I simply gave them the right to live on.

M4A1: Live on...

Dandelion: Coalescence is not necessarily a mistake. Ego and acceptance are not entirely opposed to each other.

Dandelion: Lunasia, the change you can bring will be far greater than what I can do, and when the time comes, I hope you will not refuse.

M4A1: ...

Dandelion: Let us hurry and meet with the Commander. These Dolls will not last long. We need to get to the base as soon as possible to prepare.

M4A1: Yeah... Let's move out ASAP.

The team starts making their way into the base, and just before she enters the building, M4 looks back at the Nytos. The sun illuminates the sleeves of their black dresses, casting a gentle radiance on them.

Although the Nytos have always been their enemies, for some reason, she is suddenly overcome by sympathy and a sense of nostalgia at the sight of these girls.

However, there is no turning back now.

M4 looks away. She knows that these girls in black will soon drown in red.

M16: Any last words, traitor?

UMP45: Just a little more...

M16: What's this, still putting up a fight?

UMP45: ...I wonder which of us is the real traitor?

M16: Are those your parting words? Farewell, UMP45.

UMP45: Now!

Inside the base, on the second underground level.

UMP45: Ugh...

UMP45 is advancing cautiously when she suddenly loses her balance and has to steady herself against a nearby wall.

The other Dolls in her team immediately stop in place and go to high alert.

UMP45: Dammit, they've detected me...

UMP45: The hacking attempts are getting stronger.

UMP45: But why don't they simply acquire access authorizations over my neural cloud? Why do they keep trying to read my memories of that operation instead?

UMP9: 45, are you alright?!

UMP45: I'm...fine...

416: You don't look fine at all.

Gr G11: Why does it feel like you keep breaking down today?

416: Shut your face. Keep an eye on our rear.

Gr G11: Ehhh... All right...

416: Your motor control is deteriorating.

416: Looks like the hacking's started up again, am I right?

UMP45: Humph... It never stopped...

UMP9: Wait, seriously?!

UMP9: Then we have to help you now!

UMP45: No need for that. Attacks like these can't break through my firewalls. The opposition is sustaining the forced connection in a very strange way.

UMP9: Huh? Then will you be alright?

UMP9: Should I shut down your interface ports like we did earlier?

UMP45: No. I'm using the enemy's hacking attempts to backtrace their location.

UMP45: I've already found a backdoor into them. They've probably realized this because they're intensifying their attacks on me...

416: Wait a minute, if they've discovered your ability to counter-hack them, can't they just break the connection?

UMP45: That's what's so intriguing. It would seem they are just as reluctant to disconnect as I am.

UMP9: How do you figure?

UMP45: It's simple. Both of us are trying to find something in each others' neural clouds...

UMP45: Still, this is a chance for us. The opposition is located in the direction where we're headed. If I successfully hack them, I might be able to gain some important information.

UMP45: The fact is, we know nothing about what's ahead of us, and that's dangerous.

UMP9: In that case, let me share some of the processing load.

UMP45: There's a chance that the signal source is contaminated. There might be a virus...

416: We don't have time for this kind of nonsense. Since when have we done anything that wasn't dangerous?

416: 9, hurry and plug yourself in. Try and take them down in one shot.

UMP9: Okay!

UMP9: 45, I'm coming in!

UMP45: What will I do with you... You have to disconnect immediately if any virus comes after you.

UMP9: Leave it to me, 45!
Part 2: Mixing

2

...

UMP45: The link is broken...

416: Looks like we can finally breathe easy.

UMP45: Did you steal the data from the enemy's neural cloud?

UMP9: Yeah, I did what you told me.

UMP9: But...

UMP45: But what?

UMP9: According to their most recent sensor logs, their location contains ten-odd Paradeus-like signals...

UMP9: No, I should say they're Nyto-like signals.

UMP45: If there are enemies there, it means we've got the right place. In all likelihood, they're the ones trapping Ange in there.

416: Wait a minute. Ten or more Nytos?

416: From past experience, a single Nyto controls several dozen Paradeus units at the bare minimum.

UMP45: The neural cloud data we stole indicates that no other units are present. An optimistic way of interpreting this is that the Paradeus forces have been wiped out, leaving only the Nytos behind.

416: Even if only the Nytos are left, a single Nyto is hard enough to fight as it is, let alone ten or more of them.

UMP45: You are exactly right, which is why we need to find a route that takes us to Ange as soon as possible.

416: Are you sure?

416: It's extremely likely that Paradeus has forces in reserve. We should wait for people that are suitable for head-on attacks to come by.

416: For instance, the AR Team.

UMP45: Our comms are jammed now. Would you be so kind as to run over and tell them?

416: Did that hacking attempt just now fry your logic processors?

UMP45: You don't need to worry about my neural cloud. Now do as you're told.

416 looks over to UMP9, who shakes her head helplessly.

416: ...Understood.

Several minutes later.

Squad 404 looks around, but their scouting attempts are fruitless. Currently, they are stuck in front of a locked quarantine door.

416: All the passages around us lead to dead ends. They're all cut off by quarantine doors.

416: The map Dandelion gave us doesn't show any routes we can take to get to the location of the signal jamming.

UMP9: It's no good, 45. I still can't contact DEFY... Or rather, there are no signals here at all.

UMP9: The area where DEFY is also swimming in EM interference.

UMP45: Did our previous attack scare someone? The only clue we have is a bust; what a headache.

416: If we don't interrupt the hacking, you'll need to replace your neural cloud, assuming you get the chance to do that.

UMP9: What now, 45?

UMP9: I guess there must be some kind of specialized jamming equipment in this facility, which means we can't do scans or send transmissions.

UMP45: I expected as much... If the Isomers were shipped out from here, then this must be the lab of that bastard whom Ange was talking about. That means we won't be getting in that easily.

UMP45: Things ought to get better If we can find the jamming equipment...

416: Directional jamming, huh... Looks like DEFY got trapped because they were on the mark.

UMP45: Well, I hope they haven't ended up as target practice.

UMP45: If it's a directional jammer, then the jamming device ought to be outside the jammed region, otherwise Ange would have wrecked it herself.

UMP9: But where's the jammer?

UMP45: You got me there.

UMP45: We'll split up into two teams. One team will try and enter the lab area, while the other looks for the jamming device.

416: Leaving aside the fact that none of us knows what the jammer we're searching for looks like, how do you intend to enter the lab area?

416: Or are you going to turn into a ghost and pass through this quarantine door in front of us?

UMP45: Can we blast this door open if we use all our explosives?

416: If this was a normal wall, sure, but this is...

416 walks up and raps her knuckles against the door. It produces a dull thunk.

416: This is clearly a specialized blast door made from homogeneous steel. It's at least 500mm thick, so we might not be able to bring it down even if we had two or three times the amount of explosives we currently possess.

UMP45: ...

UMP9: Maybe...there's another route?

416: This isn't a very big place. We've already checked all the routes which might lead inside.

UMP9: So...there's nothing we can do?

416: We should go back and help the Commander. Judging from that huge explosion just now, things are probably going very badly out there.

UMP45: We have a mission of our own. We can't give up on it so easily.

UMP45: Since the area is marked on the map, that means there must be a passage which leads inside.

UMP45: 9 and I will try to find the passage. You and Gr G11 should find and destroy the jammer. We'll perform both tasks at the same time.

416: Humph...

416 puts her gun down by her feet. She leans against the unopenable door and just looks at UMP45 with her arms folded in front of her chest.

UMP45: You have your orders. Didn't you hear me?

416: If such a foolhardy plan can be considered an order, then no, I didn't hear it.

UMP45: I've already told you the best solution to the problem.

416: The best solution?

416: It was one thing when we had to take on risky but well-paying missions to survive in the past. As long as you remain in the safety of the shadow, you were always able to think of a way to take out the enemy.

416: I never liked your methods, but I had to admit that I admired your ability to deal with all kinds of situations.

416: But look at you now. What are you asking us to do?

UMP45: I'm asking you to finish the mission, just like before.

416: No. You're asking us to jump into the fire, to face an enemy that we can't possibly handle head-on.

416: Don't forget, we're not like the AR Team, who can fight on through all kinds of punishment. We're meant to lurk in the darkness and quietly eliminate our enemy.

416: And now, when we might end up facing ten or more Nytos in a confined area, you want us to split into two teams?

416: How is this like any of our previous missions? Does this sound like a decision you would make?

UMP45: Oh, what's this? Is our elite Doll feeling skittish now?

416: It feels wrong to me BECAUSE I'm an elite Doll.

416: I can fight my way out of even the most intense battles with my high specs.

416: But you're not like that. UMP9 isn't like that. Gr G11 isn't like that.

416: You're all modified civilian Dolls. Or did hanging out with the AR Team make you think you were invincible?

UMP45: ...

416: I only just started wanting to stay with this team, so I don't want to see you guys end up as piles of scrap just a few minutes later.

UMP9: ...416.

Gr G11: Why...why are you fighting at a time like this?

UMP9: Don't be scared, it'll be fine.

UMP45: Humph...so you ARE scared.

UMP45: If you're afraid, then you can go ahead and leave right now. Go join the AR Team or help the Commander.

UMP45: You and I both know you've paid your debt, and you don't need to stay.

416: So you're going in, no matter what?

UMP45: Ange's still in there, and I need to rescue her.

UMP45: That's my mission.

416: No...you're not doing this to save Ange at all.

416: If I'm not mistaken...you're doing this for the Doll who went on that op with you.

416: We all saw your neural cloud fragments earlier. The reason why you're helping Ange and Griffin is because of the Doll from your past...

416: The one who's truly a sister unit to you, not like 9.

UMP45: This isn't a good time to start reminiscing about the past, don't you think?

416: Don't try to change the subject.

UMP45: I'm not going to answer you because what you're saying is utterly ridiculous.

416: Then you'd better listen up.

416: In the past, I didn't want to recall that incident, because the only thing it held for me was shame.

416: I was kicked out of my team because of you, and I had to endure the disgrace of joining a half-assed team like this one because of you.

416: I didn't want to be reminded of my shame in the least. All I wanted was an explanation from the Doll who brought all this humiliation upon me, and to make the bitch who cast me down pay the price.

UMP45: So what are you trying to say, Miss Elite Doll?

416: But after going through all sorts of things, I realized that her reason wasn't important anymore.

416: Everything has changed, and what difference would it make if I knew why she did it?

416: The past means nothing to me now. The only things that matter are the present and the future.

416: No matter how hard you chase it, what's gone is gone. If you still cherish the members of the team you're in now, then you'd better think carefully before you act, the way you usually do.

UMP45: You're you, and I'm me.

416: What difference does it make?!

416: We're both Dolls who can't go back to the past anymore!

416: We're Dolls who don't exist! Isn't that why we're called Squad 404?!

UMP45: That's where you're wrong... We're not Dolls who don't exist. We're Dolls whose very existence has been erased.

UMP45: You were lucky enough to have avoided it... Lucky enough that you didn't have to go through it...

UMP45: But all the other Dolls are dead, those humans are dead, everyone's dead!

UMP45: And only I survived...

UMP45: And all this...it's as though it never happened...as though those Dolls had never existed in the first place...

416: So what? Once you die, you don't come back, whether you're a human or a Doll!

416: But the people who are still alive need to keep living, isn't that right?!

416: Why do living people have to go blindly to their deaths for the sake of the dead?!

UMP45: Shut up! What the hell do you know?

UMP45: You never took part in that operation, you'll never know how it feels!

UMP45: My teammate, my friend, everyone who used to be by my side is dead!

UMP45: You're right, I'm not an elite Doll, I was nothing more than an expendable item with shitty performance!

UMP45: Back then, she told me that even a Doll had a reason to live on!

UMP45: So YOU listen up!

416: ...

UMP45: Reason?

UMP45: I don't give a damn about why it happened. There was no reason for them to have died there to begin with!

UMP45: What I'm doing is to make the one responsible for all of this pay!

UMP45: From the moment I escaped alive, to recruiting all of you for this team and helping Ange and Griffin, my objective has never changed, not in the slightest!

UMP45 pounds forcefully on the quarantine door next to 416's head. A dull sound echoes down the silent passageway.

416 just keeps staring at UMP45, seemingly oblivious to the sound.

UMP45: So I don't CARE if there are ten or a hundred Nytos waiting for me. I'm still going in there, even if I have to do it alone and without my Dummies.

UMP45: I admit that I don't know anything about what's in there, so I can't come up with a complete plan before making my move, like I always do.

UMP45: All I know is that if I don't keep moving forward, then everything I've done up till now might have been for nothing.

UMP45: I cannot tolerate the idea that the bastard behind all this might end up having the last laugh.

416: ...

416: Now I see why you're so eager to die.

UMP45: So what's your answer?

416: Since you're in such a hurry to throw your life away, I have no reason to stop you.

UMP45: Glad you understand.

416: The threat in there is much greater than the outside. Have 9 go with Gr G11 to find the jammer. I'll search for the way in with you.

UMP9: Eh? But...

416: You're an electronic warfare Doll. If you run into a Nyto, you won't be able to put up a fight, so you might as well do what you're good at outside.

UMP9: But what if 45 gets hacked again...

UMP45: It'll be fine, 9. I knew she'd say that.

UMP45: It seems this so-called elite Doll is as crazy as I am. In that case, wouldn't it be better for a pair of lunatics to stick together?

416: Let's make haste.

Gr G11: Er, I don't want to interrupt you, but I think I heard something above us...

Squad 404 falls silent. Nothing can be heard besides the rustling of the Dolls' clothing and the distant hum of the power generator.

416: I don't hear anything. Is this long-neglected base haunted?

Gr G11: D-d-don't scare me...

A knocking sound comes from the ceiling and grows louder and louder, then the lights suddenly go out. 404 immediately grows tense.

UMP45: Enemy attack incoming. Switch to night-vision mode, mind the corners.

Squad 404 warily scrutinizes their surroundings with weapons raised, but then the knocking stops. Just as everyone is about to relax, the sound of an explosion comes from overhead.

UMP45: Get down!

A hole is blasted out of the ceiling, which is not too high, and just as Gr G11 covers her head to protect herself from fragments, a black shape swiftly darts out and drags her through the opening.

Gr G11: Uwah! Something's got me! 416, help!!!！

UMP9: Oh no, Gr G11's been dragged into the ceiling!

416: ...What the hell, I can't shoot!

As the Dolls try to rescue Gr G11, they suddenly find themselves completely paralyzed.

UMP45: This again...

UMP45: Is it an Isomer? Or is it M16 again?

Their paralysis does not last for long. The Dolls regain control of their bodies a few seconds later.

UMP9: I... I can move...

416: 9, quickly! Lift me up!

UMP9: Ah...okay! Hup!!!

416: There's a ventilation duct up here... Not good... I'm stuck! This gap is too small!

UMP9: Let me try... It's not working, I'm stuck too.

UMP45: Let me give it a go... Looks like I can fit in there.

UMP45: No wonder they decided to take Gr G11. Still, that means they probably aren't very big either.

UMP45 turns on her tactical flashlight and inspects the wire-filled duct. Gr G11's wailing can be heard from some distance away.

UMP45: Gr G11 hasn't been taken too far away, since her signal hasn't vanished yet.

UMP45: Also...judging by the direction she's been dragged off to, this duct might take us into the jammed area.

UMP45: I'll pursue them through the duct; the two of you should split up and look for the jammer and a way in.

UMP9: You're going to look for Gr G11 yourself, 45? What if there's an ambush in there...

416: I'll widen the hole. Come down first.

UMP45: Save the explosives for what they're meant to do. If there really is an ambush, we'll be dead even if we all go in there.

UMP45: If anything happens, I should be able to figure a way out as long as I have no one else to worry about.

UMP9: Well, if you say so...

416: I'll lift you up.

416: ...And remember, come back with her.
Part 3: Pre-Heating

3

...

UMP45: This duct is way too cramped... I'll be dead for sure if there's really an ambush in there.

UMP45: Who'd have thought that I'd be doing this again? I thought I'd never have to crawl through an air vent again for the rest of my life...

UMP45: Hm? Is that a light up ahead?

45 climbs out of the duct and lands lightly on the ground.

UMP45: It's the directional jamming, I can't sense anything after all.

UMP45: What the hell is this place?

45 finds herself in a spotless room. It is spacious and filled with suspension tanks.

UMP45: Is this a lab...? As I thought, this must be where the Isomers came from.

UMP45: It's surprisingly clean... I doubt there'll be other Paradeus units around.

UMP45: Now then, where has Gr G11 been taken to?

UMP45: Speaking of which, why did they capture an outsider?

UMP45: It would have been child's play to wipe us out back then.

The lab is empty, and even the Nytos that 45 was expecting are nowhere to be seen.

The only sound in the room is that of oxygen bubbling through the tanks. While she can't pick up any enemy signals on her scans, 45 can clearly feel a watchful gaze.

She spots a small shadow standing by a big door and promptly points her gun in its direction.

UMP45: Who's there? Come out right now!

The shadow seems to be frightened of 45, because it immediately runs off into the distance. The "tap tap tap" of its footsteps echoes with unnatural clarity in the silence of the lab. 45 does not hesitate and gives chase right away. After she passes through the door, she finally spots her target.

Several "Nytos" that are roughly the size of Gr G11 are dragging the latter further into the room.

Two of them catch sight of 45 and are so startled, they just drop Gr G11 and take to their heels. But the lead "Nyto" plants herself in front of 45 with her tiny arms stretched out and glares angrily at 45.

Nyto?: Uhh!

UMP45: Brave, aren't we?

Although she looks younger than most, the girl before her is most definitely a "Nyto", both in looks and attire. 45 doesn't hesitate and prepares to pull the trigger.

???: Don't shoot!

A familiar voice comes from behind the Nyto.

45 freezes when she hears the voice. This is an opportunity, and the miniature Nyto takes it.

???: Ugh, stop!

UMP45: Not again...

The moment 45 pauses, she immediately realizes that she has once again lost control of her own body. But what is more unsettling is how the hacking attempts are returning with renewed vigor.

UMP45: Dammit, why now?!
Part 4: Sintering

4

??: Did you finally shake off the hacking?

45's consciousness gradually returns from Level II.

UMP45: Am I dead...?

??: Even if you were, I would have pieced you back together so you would continue working for me. Alright, now get up.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: I'm not dreaming, am I?

Ange: Are you so eager to see me only in your dreams?

The scene before her slowly resolves into clarity. There is no doubt that the person before her is Ange.

She offers a hand to pull 45 up to her feet, then picks up the submachine gun lying on the ground and returns it to her.

45 looks up and flinches out of reflex, because there are several tiny, blank-faced Nytos standing behind Ange.

Gr G11 lies at her feet. She seems to have fainted from fright, but she doesn't look otherwise injured.

45 only comes to her senses when Ange shoves her weapon at her.

She had been prepared to encounter all sorts of things, but she cannot make any sense of what she is seeing now.

Ange: Besides, I've never heard of Dolls dreaming before.

UMP45: Looks like you've changed jobs while I wasn't looking.

UMP45: I gather being a nanny is way better than being a Statesec agent.

Ange: Well, speaking from personal experience, I can say that babysitting is definitely more interesting than working as a government agent.

UMP45: Is it really alright to have those Paradeus people behind you?？

???: ...

Ange: If they wanted to kill me, they wouldn't have had to wait until now.

Ange: Don't worry, these kids aren't a threat.

45 looks at the miniature Nytos again. They're also staring at her warily. Like 45, they are still feeling uneasy.

UMP45: Humph... Well, let's leave them aside for now. What the hell is going on? Where are the other DEFY Dolls?

Ange: Good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?

UMP45: Start with the bad news.

Ange: The bad news is that they're sealed in another room. The entire area's been... How shall I put this, that bastard with sick hobbies locked down all the passages in the lab.

Ange: This lab's been physically and electromagnetically fortified; we spent a lot of effort finding a way into this lab.

UMP45: And the good news?

Ange: The good news is that the internal circuits are still usable, so I could keep in touch with my subordinates.

Ange: You also used those circuits to contact them earlier, didn't you?

UMP45: ...That's hardly good news.

UMP45: All I can say is that the enemy are a bunch of morons, considering they didn't even attempt to restrict internal comms.

Ange: This base was originally abandoned, so there wasn't much of a need to set up internal security.

UMP45: If only all our enemies were so lax. That would make our job so much easier.

UMP45: How are things on AK-12 and AN-94's end? Do they have Nytos to babysit too?

Ange: Pretty much.

Ange: And they're certainly enjoying it a lot more than I am.

Ange: Anyway, you came just in time for our scheduled check-in. Time to tell them our good news.

Ange picks up the fixed mic on the wall.

Ange: 12, can you hear me? Our reinforcements have finally arrived.

AK-12: Loud and clear.

AK-12: Reinforcements, you say?

AK-12: Have the female gorilla and her caretaker come back to us?

AK-12: Or have Griffin forces finally fought their way in here?

Ange: All wrong. It's UMP45.

AK-12: So it's the leader of Squad 404, huh. What about the rest of them?

Ange: Hm... Unless my eyes are playing tricks on me, it's just her.

AK-12: Just her?

Ange: Just the one.

AK-12: Alright, then. Though a single Doll can't do much, finding out exactly how much 404 hates their leader is a sort of reward in itself.

UMP45: I just saw your two other teammates. It seems your people dislike you as much as mine do me.

AK-12: So you've already met. I guess you know how things are between us now.

Ange: Ahem. EOT-1 dragged Gr G11 in here and 45 followed her through the air vents. Looks like we have a chance to disable the locks on these juveniles.

AK-12: Hm, it's true that she's the only one who can do both of those things.

Ange: Finally, we've got a good card to play.

Ange: I have to hand it to you for thinking of going through the air ducts.

UMP45: Since you found the air vent's exit, why didn't you go through it yourself?

AK-12: None of us could fit through such a small duct apart from these juveniles.

AK-12: At first, we were hoping that she could head out and find Griffin forces so they could blast through the door from the outside, but none of us expected her to bring back Miss UMP45, the weakest Doll among all present company.

AK-12: I expected nothing less of Squad 404's leader; you're always exceeding our expectations and doing things we can't.

UMP45: Well excuuuuse me for being the weakest Doll here. If you don't mind, then I, the weakest Doll, will gladly leave the way I came. After all, it's not like the weakest Doll can do anything here.

Ange: Stop wasting time taking shots at each other. 12, sync your status with 45.

AK-12: While you were playing house with those juveniles, I tried establishing a connection again, but it didn't work out. My signal couldn't merge with those juveniles' consciousness, which means I won't be able to reach their base layer.

AK-12: I'll keep trying while 94 fills you in on the situation.

AN-94: Ah, hello, Miss 45. I'm glad you managed to get in here.

AN-94: I apologize but time is very tight, so I will skip the details and only cover the main points.

AN-94: We infiltrated this base ahead of time with Ange and K. During our reconnaissance, we discovered this sealed lab and obtained some information Ange needed.

AN-94: However, Sangvis forces suddenly showed up while we were scouting, and they began fighting with Paradeus units.

AN-94: The older Nytos went to fight the S.F. units. At first we intended to investigate further, but then the lab was physically and electronically locked down.

AN-94: We lost contact with K and the other two members, and we could not leave this lab by ourselves.

AN-94: While we're trapped inside, we found these juvenile Nytos. Some of them were comatose at the time.

AN-94: Through connecting with them, we discovered that their neural clouds had been hacked and attacked by an OGAS-like signal. We decided to trace it back through the lab and found that those juveniles had sealing access to this lab.

AN-94: If we can help those children shake off the attack, we might have a chance to get out of here. However, AK-12 and I are not compatible with the OGAS Protocol, so we are having a very hard time trying to enter these girls' neural clouds.

UMP45: Wait a minute, you lost me.

UMP45: So the Paradeus signals I detected earlier were these child-like Nytos?

Ange: Actually, they're not Nytos. To be precise, they are juvenile test subjects who have not been turned into Nytos yet.

UMP45: So they haven't been mechanically augmented?

UMP45: Is that why they still look like humans?

Ange: They ARE humans. One hundred percent.

UMP45: So they're still humans?

UMP45: What lucky girls.

Ange: According to the lab records, all the specimens that could become Nytos were shipped away. The only ones left behind were the juveniles that were of little value to Paradeus, as well as those who were not up to spec.

UMP45: So they're Isomers?

Ange: Isomers?

UMP45: That's Persica's name for the specimens who failed to become Nytos.

UMP45: Also, while we were in Tallinn, the AR Team managed to secure a Nyto individual with memories of the Isomers, and she told us a bit about what happened here.

Ange: A Nyto individual...?

Ange: Looks like a lot has happened in my absence.

UMP45: I'm just as surprised by what's happened on your end.

UMP45: These Isomers seemed to be protecting the labs by themselves. Did their original controllers abandon this place because they knew we were coming?

Ange: If only things were so simple.

UMP45: Well, it would make no difference to us even if it was for some other reason.

UMP45: So, what should we do now?

Ange: We need a Doll who can connect to their neural clouds. You've hacked a Nyto before, so it should be easy for you.

UMP45: Wait a minute. How do they have neural clouds if they're humans?

Ange: I wouldn't have believed it either if DEFY hadn't verified it with me over and over again.

Ange: However, it's true that these kids have neural clouds that can be entered. Their consciousnesses have been physically embodied, like a Doll's.

UMP45: Like a Doll's, huh...

UMP45: What kind of freaking experiments did they go through...?

Ange: We can discuss this question at length once we get them out of there.

Ange: In any case, right now the only ones in Sangvis Ferri that can still hack through the OGAS Protocol are the Sangvis Mastermind and the former AR Team member...M16, who seems to be looking for something, just like us.

UMP45: But of course.

UMP45: I don't think her motives are as simple as helping Sangvis Ferri.

UMP45: She looks a little different now, but she doesn't seem to give a damn about S.F.

Ange: That's what worries me the most. An AR Team member going rogue definitely has something to do with OGAS.

Ange: I wanted to learn more about the Dolls on the AR Team from Persica, but I haven't been able to contact her for a very long time.

Ange: There is also more to S.F.'s attack on this base than meets the eye. We need to understand what Mastermind and M16 are after if we're to sort this out.

UMP45: We'll deal with things as they come, then.

UMP45: That reminds me... I was also hacked a while ago, and the opposition seemed to be checking my memories over and over again.

Ange: Your memories?

UMP45: The memories of Operation Butterfly.

Ange: ...

Ange: I think I can guess what her reasons are. At the very least, one of her goals should be the same as yours, namely uncovering the truth behind Operation Butterfly and finding the one who orchestrated the whole thing, isn't that right?

UMP45: ...If that was her aim, then she shouldn't have stopped us.

Ange: At least she's only hindering our progress and not outright eliminating us.

Ange: Still, she's far too conceited. If that bastard, that damn William really is behind all this, then it's very likely that M16 may have unwittingly helped him carry out his plan.

Ange: I'm worried that if we don't get ourselves out of this mess ASAP, the events of Operation Butterfly might repeat themselves.

UMP45: This is such a pain... Alright, if I want to connect to these juveniles, how should I do it?

Ange: Enter their neural space through this girl.

Ange places her hand on the young Nyto standing at the forefront and gently leads her up to 45.

Ange: This is Test Subject EOT-1 — at least, that's what she's referred to in the records.

Ange: These girls don't know how to use weapons, so in order to fight back, she lured us into different rooms and forcibly separated DEFY from me. She's a very clever girl.

Ange: Fortunately, as a human, I couldn't be crashed like a Doll, and so after we had a chat, she was willing to communicate and restored DEFY to normal.

Ange: I worked out a rescue plan with her so we could escape, in exchange for the safety of all the children here.

UMP45: You might as well be a dubious kidnapper offering a kid candy while abducting them.

Ange: I'm not like you. I keep my word.

UMP45: If only you had blushed even a little back when you paid us less than the sum we agreed on.

Test Subject EOT-1: Ange...is a...good person...

The young Nyto's eyes sharpen, as though 45 had uttered some kind of blasphemy.

UMP45: Alright, alright, whatever you say.

Ange: They are both victims and important witnesses.

Ange: Therefore, rescuing them is part of the mission.

Ange: Besides, I think I like kids more than I expected...

UMP45: Sometimes I think I wouldn't be able to stand you at all if it wasn't for the money.

UMP45: Now then, Miss Test Subject, how should I connect with you?

Test Subject EOT-1: Anna...

UMP45: Anna?

Test Subject EOT-1: ...Call me...Anna.

UMP45: Did you give her that name?

Ange: ...I'm not in the habit of naming other people.

UMP45: So she chose her own name?

UMP45: Sounds like she's a relative of yours.

The self-declared Anna nods. She seems very happy with what 45 has said.

The look of approval in her eyes deeply disturbs 45.

UMP45: Er... Don't look at me like that. It's unsettling.

Ange: Since you've hacked a Nyto before, it means you should be able to set up a connection with these kids, and she will lead you into their base layer.

Ange: However, you should be careful. S.F. will definitely try to take advantage of the opportunity that your entry gives them, and the attacks on you might intensify as a result.

Ange: That said, you won't be alone in there. These kids will help you while you're in their base layer. You need to bring them out and help them escape their current predicament, because that is also the only way we can escape our current predicament.

UMP45: Alright then, Miss Anna, whether you're doing this for us or for yourselves, we'd best get started as soon as possible.

Anna: Follow me.
Part 5: Foaming

5

Her surroundings fade away rapidly—

This is unlike entering other neural clouds. 45 has experienced this before, a suffocating sensation akin to being swallowed up by the sea.

Unlike how it would be in a Doll's neural cloud, she feels a wave of tremendous discomfort washing over her, as though something was squirming in the depths of her heart, and for a moment she feels extremely anxious.

UMP45: So this is a human's neural cloud... However you slice it, this is far beyond the realm of what I thought was common sense.

Anna: What should we do next?

45 looks at the other juveniles, who are far in the distance.

They are currently lying in the middle of a spinning funnel.

An attacking signal circles over their heads like an evil dragon whose dark, misty breath enshrouds them. The juveniles tremble in the mist, as though they were being electrocuted.

UMP45: ...I've never seen such a realistic-looking depiction of an electronic attack before.

Anna: It's meant to facilitate your understanding of the situation, you dummy!

Anna: The enemy is a signal created from an OGAS-transmitted core order. My sisters have their hands full just fending off the attack.

Anna: However, the enemy keeps changing the logical concepts of this electronic space. If this keeps up, they'll be assimilated by the attacking OGAS signals. If that happens, we'll be done for!

UMP45: ...So...you aren't actually a blank-faced kid with a stammer...?

Anna: Isn't that obvious? Like I said, you're a dummy!

Anna: Of course I can do whatever I want in my own neural cloud! Shouldn't a Tactical Doll know that much?

Anna: To think Ange told me you were one of the best electronic warfare Dolls she's ever seen! Instead of thinking about how to solve the problem at hand, you're concerned about something so trivial?!

Anna: And you call yourself Ange's subordinate? Do you have no shame?

Anna: You nitwit! Idiot! Moron!

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Listen up, brat, I'm not obliged to save you or anything. I consider my job done as long as I get Ange out alive.

UMP45: You and these test subjects are nothing more than a burden to me. Got that?

Anna: Wh...what...? Aren't you going to save us?

UMP45: From my point of view, saving you is the least efficient course of action. Given my tendencies, I would never have done this if Ange hadn't asked me to.

Anna: But Ange already asked you to...

UMP45: I never said I'd obey her orders.

Anna: But...but... you're in my neural cloud, so you have to listen to me!

UMP45: You can save those words for that attacking signal over there.

Anna: ...

Anna: ...

UMP45: Anything else you'd like to add?

Anna: Uuu...UWWWAAAAAAAHHH!!!

UMP45: Hey...you don't need to turn on the waterworks just because I scolded you.

Anna: We're doomed! (Sobs) Nobody can save us now!

Anna: The only one who can enter this place is a brainlet that's all talk! We're doomed!

UMP45: Oi, who are you calling "a brainlet that's all talk"?

Anna: You're either a big old meanie who'll watch people die without lifting a finger or an incompetent idiot, take your pick!

UMP45: I have just about had it with this brat...

UMP45: You're totally not giving me enough credit. Fine, fine, I get it.

UMP45: I'll draw away OGAS' electronic attack. How's that, are you happy now?

Anna: Are you stupid?

Anna: If all of us are being tied up by that one signal, what the heck can you do with the processing power of just a single Doll?

Anna: You're just going to get yourself killed right away, don't you see?!

UMP45: You really are a whiny brat. While I was wasting time entertaining your nonsense, I've already finished analyzing the signal attacking you. It's hardly strong enough to kill me if that's all there is to it.

UMP45: Also, the bitch who's holding you prisoner desperately wants to learn something from me.

UMP45: She won't let me die until she has what she wants.

Anna: What...

UMP45: The world is way more complicated than you can imagine, so don't get too full of yourself.

UMP45: In any case, listen up. My plan is very simple; I'm going to draw away the attacking OGAS signal and do my best to slow it down.

UMP45: Meanwhile, your job is to restore your friends' control over their own consciousnesses. After that, come back and help me strengthen the firewalls so we can defeat that attacking signal together.

UMP45: If you fail, we'll all be stuck here, and it doesn't matter how much time I can buy. You HAVE to do this. Do you understand?

Anna: I'll do my part, and you'll do what you have to do, got it?

Anna: If YOU fail, I will never forgive you...

Anna's consciousness floats over to the unconscious juveniles, waiting for 45 to do as she promised.

UMP45: Humph... Don't try to play cool until you're as tall as I am...

UMP45: Now then, it's time to deal with that verdammt attacking signal...

UMP45: I know what you want, M16; surely nothing is more precious than one's lost memories, no?
Part 6: Foam Stabilization

6

...

She hears the whistling of steam and the clamor of grinding gears.

Her index finger starts to ache, and there's a soreness coming from the back of her head.

UMP45 knows very well that she's back here.

Once again...she is inside the main Sangvis Ferri factory, on the day of Operation Butterfly.

She suddenly understands the meaning of what M16 has said to her.

UMP45: "I wanted to resolve the grudge between us in person."

Her memories flow in reverse once more, then the rewind comes to an end—

As though all the sentimental thoughts she just had were never real.

UMP45: Honestly...this is just too...old hat.

Then, as though somebody has pressed the "play" button, the memory begins to replay itself once again.

M16A1: Any last words, traitor?

UMP45: Just a little more...

M16A1: What's this, still putting up a fight?

UMP45: ...I wonder which of us is the real traitor?

M16A1: Are those your parting words? Farewell, UMP45.

UMP45: —!

There was a burst of gunfire, and several bullet holes appeared in 45's head.

UMP45: ...

M16A1: Now you're quiet, huh.

M16A1: Looks like this really was the last one.

M16 turned away and briefly hesitated before taking out a spare magazine.

She pulled the empty magazine out of her weapon and tossed it away, but before it could even hit the ground, M16 collapsed onto her knees in pain.

M16A1: Urgh—!

M16A1: My chest...hurts...!

It took all her strength, but M16 managed to stand up. In the distance, a blinking red camera head pointed itself at her.

She couldn't even hold her weapon; her rifle slipped out her hands.

Dust swirled and danced around the falling rifle, then everything seemed to freeze - both the rifle and the dust stopped moving in mid-air.

...

...

All motions ceased, as if time itself had come to a halt, or perhaps like a three-dimensional photograph.

UMP45 gets to her feet, brushing off the dust and shell casings from her body.

UMP45: I see. So if I were destroyed, she would suffer a meltdown as well.

UMP45: All the Dolls had been infected with Parapluie back then, and they had all either gone berserk or had a neural cascade at almost the same time.

UMP45: In the end, only she and I survived.

UMP45: If I survived because I was lucky enough to have been overlooked, then how did she get out of that alive?

UMP45 shakes her head.

UMP45: These are simulated memories. Even if I asked, there's no way I'd get an answer...

UMP45: Even now, I didn't manage to survive a single encounter with her in the hundreds of simulations I've conducted.

UMP45: Was what happened back then really a miracle to end all miracles?

UMP45: In that case, let's go through the sequence again while that demoness hasn't found me yet.

M16A1: You're certainly enjoying yourself.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Humph, caught at last, huh.

M16A1: I didn't expect you to be stupid enough to walk right into it.

UMP45: Save your bravado, we both know electronic warfare isn't your strong suit.

UMP45: Also, you seem much slower than you used to be, considering I managed to go through so many playbacks before you realized what I was doing.

UMP45: So, did your neural cloud go binary after you joined S.F.?

M16A1: You don't need to throw your life away in such a hurry. I remember I've already warned you about this.

UMP45: And I heard your warning loud and clear, just as I did back then.

M16 bends down and picks up her rifle.

M16A1: I should have killed you back then.

UMP45: Yes, you should have. But you didn't.

UMP45: And you don't know why you didn't do it.

M16 chambers a round, and her eyes flash with murderous intent.

UMP45: You can't restore those deleted memories no matter what you do, isn't that right?

UMP45: That's why you want to learn what happened back then from me, but you're afraid I'd figure out your intentions, so you carefully tried to steal the memories without drawing my attention.

M16A1: ...

UMP45: You don't even remember the moment you betrayed your own team, do you?

M16A1: You shouldn't have said that. Are you ready to pay for it?

UMP45: Your frank and earnest desire to skin me alive right now suits you better than that nonsense you were spouting as part of your act.

M16A1: Humph, come on then. I'll beat you, just like I did before.
Part 7: Molding

7

UMP45: The attacking signal vanished. Did I win?

UMP45: No... Her processing power is far stronger than mine. She beat me.

UMP45 slowly gets up on her feet. She can tell that she's in her Level III base layer.

UMP45: How merciful of her for not finishing me off instantly.

UMP45: So she's forced me into my own base layer. Is she that desperate to read my memories from back then?

UMP45: However, I've encrypted those memories, so it'll probably take her a while to find them.

UMP45: Will you help me in the last bit of time I have left?

???: I thought you'd never come back here again.

UMP45: ...And I would not, if I could have avoided it.

???: What should I say, then? Welcome back? Or gute reise?

UMP45: Stop teasing me. Why wish me a good journey when I'm obviously not going anywhere?

???: Ja, ja, I understand.

???: After all, something bad must've happened, or you wouldn't have wound up getting trapped in here again. Am I right, 45?

The UMP40 residing in the depths of 45's neural cloud slowly comes into view.

She grins happily at 45. She knows that 45 must have met with some terrible danger to have ended up in her base layer, but being able to see her again fills this simulated persona with heartfelt joy.

UMP45: Yeah... I ran into a crisis that made a mockery of all the cool things I said in the past.

UMP45: And here I thought I'd only meet you again to bid you farewell after settling everything.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: That's fine. You look super cool even when you're as wretched as this, 45.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I don't mind chatting with you a few more times before we say our goodbyes.

UMP45: Honestly... Right, do I need to explain the situation to you?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I exist in your neural cloud. I've been quietly watching everything that's happened to you.

UMP45: So...you know exactly what I've overheard before, right?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: You mean the fact that I'm not a manifestation of your longing for 40...but a consciousness born from the virus?

UMP45: So you do know.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Yup. I know what you know.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Don't worry, I'm glad you know exactly what I am.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If I'm more than a simulated personality, that means I can at least be of some help, right?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: The OGAS of the AR Team's leader is super strong, she can help her Doll do so much. I'm envious.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If only I had power like that...

UMP45: ...It all started because of OGAS, and yet everyone's becoming more reliant on its power.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: There's nothing wrong with power in itself.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If I also had the power to help you, would I have been a useful aide to you, the way Miss Dandelion is to M4A1?

UMP45: I don't need...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: But right now, you DO need help.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If my appearance makes you uncomfortable, I can...

UMP45: ...

UMP45: No...ignore what I just said. This isn't the time to dwell on my own past.

UMP45: I need to use all the power I can get my hands on. If I can't get out of this place, then everything will be for nothing.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: So you're saying...

UMP45: I need your help. I don't care if you're an image of her past or an OGAS entity that developed from the virus.

UMP45: If you're willing to help me, please lend me your strength so I can keep the promise I once made.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Heheh, I would have done that even if you hadn't asked.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I have to hand it to you; you're really resilient.

UMP45: ...Stop making fun of me. Focus on the mission.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Alright, alright, you're the boss.

UMP45: Now that I think about it, you're the reason why I could enter M4's neural cloud and the Nyto's consciousness.

UMP45: M16 ought to be no different. Since she wants to read my memories so badly, is there a way we can turn the tables on her and expose her weakness?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Normally that wouldn't be possible, because your body's processing power is very limited.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: You've been upgraded, but even with that, infiltrating such a high-spec neural cloud would be very difficult.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: However...

UMP45: However?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: However, an OGAS Protocol signal just tried to connect with me from the outside. After briefly making contact with it, I realized I could tap into an external source of processing power through the link.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If they can give me enough computational support, I might be able to crack the logic algorithm that's sealing off your Level II layer, or even do what you said and reverse-penetrate the opposition's neural cloud.

UMP45: Looks like the brat has done her job.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Should I establish the connection?

UMP45: Can you?

UMP45: But isn't it only possible to connect through an ID signal at the moment?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If that's all I need to do...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Please hold...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Whoa, where the heck am I? It's pitch black!

UMP45: You are...?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Are you stupid?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: It's me, Anna!

UMP45: I guessed as much.

UMP45: I didn't expect her to establish comms in this manner.

Anna: What are you spacing out for?!

Anna: We're all okay on our end, but the OGAS signal has you thoroughly trapped. I tried pulling you out a few times, but I couldn't.

Anna: However, I found a circuit in your base layer that's connected to an OGAS consciousness in your neural cloud, so I used the opening to get in!

Anna: You really are different from other Dolls - you have an OGAS interface in your base layer, how surprising. Make sure you don't get wiped out in there!

UMP45: Why, thank you for your concern.

Anna: Your partner told me all about your plan. We will try to provide you with processing power.

Anna: Everyone's waiting for you outside, so make sure you don't kick the bucket in there!

UMP45: That's a big help. Tell Ange I won't be long.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: What a cute little girl... Is she a new friend of yours, 45?

UMP45: A new pain in the ass, more like...

UMP45: Can we begin now?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Ja. I'm analyzing the source of the opposition's data flows.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: One moment...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Alright, I've synchronized and combined the shared records from both sides. With that, we should be able to find the opening which leads to the opposition's neural cloud.

UMP40's simulated persona begins loading information into her surroundings, and the scene UMP45 once saw in Tallinn gradually unfolds before her.

Under an inverted forest, the familiar mansion lies not far away.

UMP45: This is what I saw in M4's neural cloud back then...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Yup. M16 has this in her neural cloud as well.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: She's trying to merge with your neural cloud, but the memories here overlapped, and the overlapping processes were skipped.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Therefore, this is an opening where the firewall is weaker. We might be able to invade her neural cloud through this gap.

UMP45: Why is the firewall weaker there?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: M4's and M16's neural clouds were probably derived from the same person.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: According to my records, the neural clouds for the AR Team were all made from the brain scan of the same human, which is why their neural clouds can't be duplicated or backed up.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Meanwhile, this portion of memories belonged to the original human, which probably means it's a read-only section. That implies the OGAS consciousness can't make big alterations to that piece of data.

UMP45: The same person... I'm getting really tired of hearing the name Lunasia.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I re-sorted the data from before. This information has always been a blind spot for us. Perhaps the truth has always been right within our reach, but we simply had no way of perceiving it.

UMP45: If it involves the AR Team, that implies Persica also has a part in this.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I can't reach a conclusion just from the data you possess.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: But in any case, M16's agenda might be hidden deeper than we imagined. We need to figure out what she has in mind.

UMP45: ...When you put it that way, all her seemingly illogical actions could be intended to disrupt a plan we haven't even heard of yet.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Is that so? Or is that what you want to believe?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Maybe deep down in your heart, you do admire her.

UMP45: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: You like her, yet you hate her.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Hm... Looks like you regard the whole AR Team in the same way.

UMP45: You don't need to go out of your way to tell me when you pry into my thoughts.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If you had their power, you'd definitely use it better than they did.

UMP45: Hypothetical scenarios are irrelevant. Right, let's get down to business.

UMP45 and UMP40 enter the mansion under the inverted forest.

Unlike how it was before, the house looks like it hasn't been maintained for many years. The doors are on the floor and the interior is covered in a thick layer of dust.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: This mansion is in a place where the memories overlap, but something feels strange...

UMP45: Hm? Did you sense something?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: The overlapping segment isn't as big as I expected. The layout of the house is different from what we saw earlier.

UMP45: Could it be a trap?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't have to go about it in such a convoluted manner.

UMP45: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Don't worry, I just want to talk.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: Why don't we go out to the yard? I don't really like the oppressive atmosphere inside the house.

UMP45 realizes that things aren't quite right, but she knows she is at a massive disadvantage in this place.

Somebody seems to have taken over UMP40's simulated persona, and it happened so quickly they didn't even have a chance to react.

UMP45 has no choice but to comply. She approaches the garden in the backyard cautiously, but it is completely empty.

UMP45: There's no one here.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I don't know why, but seeing this garden always puts me at ease.

UMP45: Are you M16?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: What do you think?

UMP45: If you're not her, then who are you?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: We've met before, haven't we?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: During Operation Butterfly.

UMP45: What...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: We have almost achieved our objective. You cannot stop us.

UMP45: So what are you doing now? Playing a game of cat and mouse?

UMP45: If you could crush us in an instant, then why didn't you kill me from the start?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I don't want to destroy you. Doesn't matter if you're from Squad 404, the AR Team, or Griffin.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: You are not my enemy.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I will help M16 get what she wants. Since she helped me, I will help her.

UMP45: What do you want...?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: You guessed it. I want to see the memories that she has lost.

The simulated persona of UMP40 waves her hand, and the surroundings immediately transform into the scene from Operation Butterfly in 45's memories.

UMP45: Just a little more...

M16: Still putting up a fight, traitor?

UMP45: ...I wonder which of us is the real traitor?

M16: Are those your parting words? Farewell, UMP45.

UMP45: Now!

M16: !!!

M16 was shocked to find that her bullets had gone past UMP45's original position and made two holes on the ground.

Crack! UMP45's left wrist snapped. She had deliberately broke the wrist that M16 had in her grip in order to buy herself a chance to fight back.

Although she'd already turned off the pain receptors in her left arm, the instinctive feedback of the displaced machinery was still extremely disconcerting.

However, there was no time to think about that. UMP45 spun around and kicked as hard as she could, freeing herself from M16's grasp.

She rode the momentum of the reaction force to pick up her gun, then turned around and took aim at M16.

M16A1: I didn't think you could disrupt my fire control system in such a short time. You've done very well for a Doll like you.

UMP45: All those Dolls by the door were shot in the back. That must have been your handiwork.

M16A1: My mission is to eliminate all traitorous Dolls.

UMP45: So you knew something like this was going to happen.

UMP45: You'd betrayed us all from the very beginning!

M16A1: ...

UMP45: Have you thought about what will happen to you in the end?

UMP45: Do you think you can avoid being silenced too?!

M16A1: That's not for you to worry about.

M16A1: You just have to die here.

M16 opened fire on UMP45 without any hesitation, but she couldn't land a shot due to UMP45's interference.

UMP45 took the opportunity to duck behind the closest piece of cover and changed her empty magazine as she pondered her next move.

UMP45: I'm almost out of ammo... I can't defeat her just by disrupting her shooting. What else can I do?

M16 rained suppressive fire down on UMP45 as she slowly approached the cover which UMP45 was hiding behind.

UMP45 counted M16's shots, intending to counterattack once she's out of ammo. However, M16 changed magazines with incredible speed, giving UMP45 no time to poke her head out and shoot.

Bullets pounded UMP45's cover. All she could do was keep her head down to avoid the incoming fire.

She banished all unnecessary thoughts from her mind, quietly waiting for the only chance she had of obtaining victory.

Another magazine was discarded. M16 was very close to UMP45's hiding place.

The empty magazine fell, but before it could hit the ground, M16 was already on her knees, writhing in pain.

M16A1: Urgh... What's going on...?!

UMP45: It's finally begun... She's having a neural meltdown!

UMP45 leaned against her cover and fired at M16, but she had a hard time controlling her aim without her left hand.

With great effort, M16 raised her arm to shield her vitals while laying down suppressive fire.

Her hasty shots did not hit UMP45 directly, but the sparks and dust that they threw up obscured her vision.

As the hammer fell on an empty chamber, M16 took advantage of the gap in UMP45's fire and dashed toward her...

Right before UMP45 could take aim again, M16 switched her grip on her gun, grabbed it by the barrel, and swung it at UMP45. The massive impact sent UMP45's weapon flying from her hand.

M16 used her momentum to grab UMP45 by the collar and pinned her down once more, and the dagger she pulled out from her back gleamed menacingly in the light.

UMP45 instinctively clawed at M16's face in an attempt to push her off.

In her desperation, her fingers actually mangled the left half of M16's face.

M16 paid no heed to her injury. She held her knife with both hands and plunged it viciously at UMP45's head—

But in the confusion, UMP45 reached out and blocked the stab with her right hand.

There was a mighty crack as her right arm broke. The intense pain caused UMP45's hand to claw a horrific scar into M16's face.

M16 paid that no mind either and savagely forced her knife down on UMP45's head, and this time, UMP45 had no way to stop her.

UMP45: !!!

UMP45 felt the sharp tip of the dagger on her skin. There was no escape.

But then, the knife suddenly stopped in its tracks. Through her half-opened right eye, UMP45 saw that M16 was still straddling her, but her gaze was strangely dull, as though she had lost consciousness.

UMP45: So she finally burned out, huh... That was a close shave...

The knife had left a deep scar on UMP45's left eye.

She tried to push M16's frozen hands away from her face, but M16 would not budge, pinning UMP45 beneath her.

UMP45: You won't let me go even when you're dead, huh... Whew... forget it, let me take a breather first—

M16 suddenly came back to life, and the cold look in her eyes chilled UMP45 to the core.

The only thought that echoed in UMP45's neural cloud was, "It's over," as despair swallowed her like a bottomless abyss.

However, M16 did not resume her attack. She stood up and sheathed her knife behind her, picked up her rifle, and turned to leave.

UMP45: What's the meaning of this...? Not going to kill me?

M16A1: ...

M16 looked at 45 one last time, then she bolted from the room.

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I think I understand everything that's happened that day.

UMP45: ...M16 didn't finish me off back then. Was it because of you?

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I made a deal with her. I would save her from a neural meltdown, and she would let me see my father one last time.

UMP45: ...

UMP40's Simulated Persona: I believe you have already guessed who I am.

UMP45: I didn't think I'd meet you under these circumstances, Elisa.

Elisa: I am very glad that your first response was not to reject me.

UMP45: You took control of her body back then... So you let go of me since I was no longer of any value?

Elisa: I need to thank you. If it wasn't for you, I would have still been sealed inside the Pike Core.

Elisa: But at the same time, I resent you. If it wasn't for you, Father wouldn't have died back then, even though I know it was not your fault.

Elisa: We both lost everything we cherished on that day. Don't you think that makes us very similar?

UMP45: So you're trying to win me over in a very roundabout way?

Elisa: I simply want to tell you a few things you should know. We both hate the same enemy. There is no need for us to kill each other before we find him.

Elisa: M16 understands that, and I believe so will you.

UMP45: ...

UMP45: Alright, I'm listening.

Elisa: Father was afraid he had made the wrong choice, so he deleted a lot of important authorizations that were originally part of the OGAS System. That's why I have always been incomplete.

Elisa: However, the Dolls of the AR Team are built with completely intact base layer protocols, and Father was calling out for Persica, their creator, in his final moments.

Elisa: In the end, when our own OGAS systems developed, their consciousness were similar, yet different.

UMP45: So that's why you've been trying to connect with M4 all the while.

Elisa: However, I've lost hope in her. Right now, I can finish everything by myself, even if I lose everything I created.

Elisa: So don't interfere with our plans. Similarly, I won't hurt you either.

Elisa: Once the coalescence is complete, the truth will be revealed to everyone who's been deceived.

UMP45: Coalescence?

UMP45: Wait... Don't tell me you're going to...!

Elisa: You have given me what I want, so I will spare you.

Elisa: But remember, this is my final warning.

Elisa: Do not become my enemy, or you will regret your decision.

UMP45 feels a shift in her surroundings. Elisa's consciousness has left the simulated persona of UMP40.

The seal on her neural cloud is gradually lifted, and she can hear Anna and the others calling out to her.

UMP45 hesitates briefly. There has been a massive shift in everything she once thought she knew. She needs to think about all the things she has just learned.

In any case, the seal has now been broken. She decides to return to Level II before considering what she will do next.

The young Nyto senses UMP45's return and immediately forms a link with her.

Anna: You...you actually did it! The remote attack is gone!

Anna: Looks like Ange wasn't wrong about you after all!

UMP45: So you're just as quick to praise as you are to insult. Can't say I dislike this kind of candor.

UMP45: What's the situation out there?

Anna: My sisters are fine; they've all woken up.

Anna: We've deactivated the jamming and lifted the lockdown on the labs, but you'd better keep your word and keep us safe!

UMP45: Take this matter to Ange... I'm very tired right now...

UMP45: I'm going to rest for a bit before resurfacing. Go on ahead and discuss our next move with the others outside.

Anna: Okay... I'll relay that to Ange.

UMP45: Should I tell Ange about what I just learned?

UMP45: Everything's become even more complicated.
Part 8: Annealing

8

...

20 minutes ago, at the military staging area.

Yegor: Terra to Hematite. Sitrep. Over.

Military Officer: This is Hematite. We've linked up with the remnants of Quartz's troops. We're currently exchanging fire with Sangvis Ferri and Paradeus forces.

Military Officer: Unable to break through swiftly, I repeat, unable to break through swiftly. Over.

Yegor: Terra copies. Report losses. Over.

Military Officer: Hematite copies. We are still able to carry out the mission. No need to worry, Terra. Over.

Yegor: Terra copies. Commencing creeping barrage in 20 seconds. Zircon will assist ASAP. Maintain your advance. Over.

Military Officer: Acknowledged. Over.

The transmission ends.

Adjutant: Captain, Hematite's situation must be dire, and we don't have many infantry and automatons left.

Yegor: I know. Lieutenant, bring them out. Time to play our ace in the hole.

Adjutant: Yes, sir!

Outside the breach in the barrier gate.

The small opening is piled high with mechanical carcasses, spent ammunition and human corpses.

It hasn't been half an hour since the fighting started, but both sides have already committed all their forces to this final battle.

Alchemist: Bring it on, humans!

Hunter: Get down!

Hunter: Dammit, they've got a few cannons on their side, huh. What about those white guys?

Alchemist: They're all gone. That most recent bombardment probably blew up the last of them.

Hunter: Tsk! Do we have any reserve forces?

Alchemist: It's just the two of us and our minions. Executioner just carried Scarecrow away. Look, do you see anyone else?

Hunter: So I'm going to die with you? Please, no.

Alchemist: If you've got the time to flap your artificial gums, why don't you...

Hunter: Why don't I what, I didn't hear you! Or did you not say anything at all?

Alchemist: Look, you jinxed it. The human tanks are coming.

Hunter: Is there an end to them? Don't humans have to mourn their fallen comrades?

Alchemist: Considering how they're swarming us like insects, I think it's quite likely that they don't believe in God at all.

As they share a laugh, the two elite Sangvis Dolls get up and raise their weapons.

Hunter: Sangvis Ferri! CHARGE!

At the Griffin temporary camp.

Commander: How's the situation?

Kalina: The S.F. remnants are still engaged with the Military, but the Paradeus units have all been wiped out.

Commander: How are our preparations?

Kalina: We've almost finished planting the explosives. Are we really not going to assist the Sangvis forces? According to the latest report, the Military tanks are closing in on them...

Commander: I know, but we don't have the strength to spare now.

Commander: We can barely put enough Dolls together to form a line of defense, so we'll have to wear them down with street fighting.

Kalina: Got it.

Commander: Keep a close eye on the Military forces. They under the situation very well themselves. I'm sure they'll try something.

At the breach in the barrier gate.

Precious few S.F. units have survived the combined onslaught of the tanks and the artillery.

Alchemist: Hunter, how many units do you have left?

Hunter: I thought you were the one counting. Who knows?

Alchemist: I was only looking at the ones I was commanding. Besides, it's your hands, not your brains that got damaged.

Hunter: Well, if your eyes are so sharp, why don't you go snipe a few of those humans?

Alchemist: I can snipe, sure, but I can't guarantee I won't blow your head off along with theirs.

Hunter: Ha-ha, very funny.

Hunter: Still, to think we're going to drown in trash in this waste processing plant... It's gross, I don't want to remember this.

Alchemist: Well, if you have a problem with that, go take it up with those humans... Hey, what are you guys doing here? Didn't we tell you to withdraw with Agent?

Hunter looks back and catches sight of two figures that she's long grown tired of seeing.

Scarecrow: Why didn't you tell me you were doing something fun?

Executioner: I don't like owing people favors, so I'm just paying it all back at once.

Hunter: You morons! What point is there in you dying here?

Executioner: When I think about how Agent might nag us until we fall to bits, I'd rather you take the blame for it instead.

Scarecrow: I'd feel worse if I just walked off like that.

Hunter: Why, you...!

Alchemist: Alright, alright, those humans aren't going to wait for you to be ready; they're coming right away.

Alchemist: Besides, it's not too bad for us to die together as one big happy family, right?

Hunter: Seriously, you guys! Alright, then. Sangvis Ferri! —

Before Hunter can finish, an explosion drowns out the rest of her battle cry.

However, it does not come from among the S.F. lines, but opposite them.

The explosion erupts in the midst of the Military soldiers.

Destroyer: Aha, ahahaha! Die, all of you!

On a hill to the south of the frontlines, a tiny figure launches a vast quantity of grenades, which detonate and seal off the Military's advance.

Dreamer: Did you miss my fire support, useless seniors?

Executioner: Hah! You two shorties made it!

Dreamer: I don't mind if you want to chat.

Dreamer: I'll record how you died because of idle chatter and play it to you when we get back.

A horde of Sangvis Dolls appear on the top of the hill, and a close look reveals that all of them are in desperate need of repair.

However, these Dolls, who previously escaped the encirclement, have doubled back and rejoined the Sangvis front.

Thanks to the surprise assault from the flank, the Military's advance is halted and the battle-scarred elite Dolls finally get a chance to retreat.

Hunter: Thank you, we're all clear.

Dreamer: Don't thank me yet. Soon you'll find out what a terrible thing it is to owe me one.

Dreamer: —Oi, little idiot, we're pulling out. These are the last toys we managed to beg from Agent!

Destroyer: Eh?! Then this is a rare opportunity! Also, who are you calling an idiot?!

Dreamer: If you want to stay here and become fertilizers, be my guest.

Destroyer: Urgh... Wait, what's that?

Destroyer points to a cloud of dust in the distance, behind the Military lines.

Dreamer: Who knows? It looks like some kind of mech...

Dreamer: Wait a minute, that's not right. It's something more interesting than that...

At the forward position of the Military lines.

Armored Unit Officer: This is Zircon, please adjust fire support coordinates. I repeat, please adjust fire support coordinates. A large S.F. unit has appeared on the left flank, over.

???: Roger. Cease fire support, there's no need to get locked in combat. All units, clear Advance Route 13 and follow me in an assault on the breach in the wall, over.

Armored Unit Officer: This is Zircon, requesting ID. Over.

Yegor: This is Terra. I'm on the frontlines, in Amber 4. Over.

Armored Unit Officer: Zircon copies. Over!

Four massive mechs weave through the Military formation, moving at a speed that doesn't seem possible for such vast, towering machines.

In the blink of an eye, they're already at the leading edge of the Military lines. S.F. shells detonate around their feet, but they do not so much as slow the mechs' movements.

Yegor: The breach is too narrow. Focus fire and blast it open.

Adjutant: Amber 1 copies!

BOOM!

After a barrage of plasma pulses, part of the quarantine wall explodes and collapses.

Yegor: Well done, comrades. This is Terra. All units, assault the main elevator within the submarine base.

Several minutes ago, at the Griffin temporary defense line.

Kalina: Commander! The AR Team has linked up with us!

Commander: This is great. M4, can you hear me?

M4A1: Loud and clear. I'm sorry, Commander... I couldn't stop those soldiers from firing the shore guns...

Commander: You've done enough. What's your current situation?

M4A1: Our team has sustained light damage, but we are still combat effective. Dandelion has already regrouped with us.

Commander: Good.

Commander: What's your present position? Have you made it into the base?

Commander: We're preparing to detonate the second entrance. If you haven't come in yet, you'd better hurry.

M4A1: We've already entered the base and are preparing to follow the demolition echelons. We should be able to help them finish planting the explosives more quickly.

Commander: Excellent. Any other news about the Military?

M4A1: The Military ought to be grappling with S.F. forces right now. They should be able to buy us some time.

Commander: Sangvis Ferri?

M4A1: It's a long story, but in short, Dandelion can control some of their troops to help us delay the Military. We might even be able to keep the Military stuck outside.

Commander: That would be extremely helpful... Carry on and finish your work.

M4A1: Roger. M4 out.

Kalina: Commander...is this really a good idea? If we demolish both entrances to the base, doesn't that mean we'll also be trapped in here?

Commander: I hope Havier wasn't lying to us earlier. If they can't deliver on their promise, it means that we're just making a concrete coffin for ourselves...

Commander: But our comms equipment got blown up along with the train, so we can't even ask him about the situation now.

Kalina: Commander, Mr. K has regained consciousness. Maybe he's got a solution for us!

Commander: When did he come to?

Kalina: It happened while you were busy deploying our forces for the demolition mission. I didn't tell you because it didn't seem important back then.

Commander: ...Let's go meet the guy while we still have the time to spare.

K: Where are we?

Commander: We're inside the sub base. The Military has us surrounded, so we're trying to destroy the entrances to delay their advance.

K: Where's Ange?

Commander: We haven't managed to contact her yet. I've sent a search party in to look for her.

K: That useless woman...

Commander: If there's nothing else, I'll be heading back to the defense line.

K: Don't you have questions for me, Griffin Commander?

Commander: Based on previous experience, I doubt you'll give me any straight answers anyway.

Commander: Said experience also tells me that you won't be giving me any so-called support either.

K: ...

Commander: So let's not waste each other's time.

K: I can provide fire support that'll be of actual use to both of us.

Commander: Really now?

Commander: And why would the brass provide me with fire support or whatnot? It sounds as ridiculous as Yegor agreeing to shake hands with me and call it off.

K: Don't mock me with such nonsense.

K: It's true that we're insignificant in their eyes, but things will be different if we have something of value to them.

Commander: What do you mean?

K: I need to know if Ange has completed her mission.

Commander: Her mission?

K: Don't play dumb with me. The name is still confidential, but you must have heard it already.

Commander: You mean "William"?

K: Humph, so you DO know about him after all.

K: We need to collect all his research data in the base and find clues that will help us verify his location.

K: If we have that information on hand, I'll be able to convince the observers to help us.

K: Even the slightest move on their part will be enough for us to survive this crisis.

Kalina: Commander! There's been a new development!

Commander: What is it?

Kalina: It's an urgent report from the AR Team!

Kalina: The Military is attacking the second entrance with a type of mech that we've never seen before; they didn't fire on our forces but charged straight into the base!

Kalina: We can't stop them! I'm sending over the footage now!

The display shows giant mechs advancing at top speed, leaving their own tanks far behind them.

Commander: What the fucking hell are these things?!

K: Those are Sinners, enhanced Assault Artillery mechs. It looks like the commander of this Military force is leading the assault in person.

Commander: Since when did the Military have mechs of this class? I've never heard of them before!

Kalina: The armored units behind them are advancing too! What should we do now?

Commander: Trigger the explosives!

Kalina: They haven't all been planted yet!

Commander: It doesn't matter, detonate them right now!

Boom! Boom!

Explosions go off one after the other, shaking the base and jarring dust loose from the ceiling.

Kalina: Did we stop them?

Commander: I didn't expect them to have something else up their sleeve... Contact the AR Team!

Kalina: O...okay!

M4A1: Commander, do you read me?

Commander: What's the situation at the entrance?

M4A1: We only managed to plant half of the explosives. The entrance gate wasn't completely destroyed.

Commander: Forget the gate. AR Team, take the DEFY members and one HOC to pursue the mechs that entered the base. And bring Dandelion with you!

M4A1: But the defenses of the main gate...

Commander: Let me worry about that. Make sure you stop those mechs!

M4A1: Roger, we'll head out right away.

The moment the transmission ends, another one comes through instantaneously.

Angelia: Still alive, Commander?

Kalina: Miss...Miss Ange?

Angelia: Thank goodness, so Griffin hasn't been completely wiped out yet.

Angelia: Squad 404 has found us and disabled the lockdown, so we can join the fight now.

Angelia: I heard a huge explosion just now. What's going on?

Commander: We're holding off the Military forces at the base entrance. A team of mech units have charged into the base. I'm guessing they're Yegor and his bodyguard unit. The AR Team is moving to intercept. Hopefully you can provide some support.

Commander: We couldn't completely destroy the entrance, so we'll be engaging the Military's follow-up units.

Angelia: Is K still alive?

K: I'm still in one piece, thank you very much.

Angelia: Then do something so we have a chance to survive. You keep flaunting that sparkling record of yours, surely you can put it to use now, right?

K: How are things in the lab?

Angelia: We've collected all the things you wanted. There are also living specimens present. I promised them that I'd get them out of here alive.

K: Humph. I'll think of something.

Angelia: Commander, please let me command the AR Team. I'll make sure I finish off that bastard Yegor once and for all.

Commander: Understood. Come back alive.

Angelia: I'll try. Ange out.
Part 9: Tempering

9

...

Commander: Kalina, what's the situation?

Kalina: After breaking through, the mechs are heading straight for...the base elevator. Looks like they're planning to descend into the lower levels of the base.

Commander: Where the Starfish is, huh...

Commander: Let Ange handle it. We can't split our forces any further.

Commander: How are things at the base entrance?

Kalina: The Military's follow-up units are trying to cross the roadblocks that we blasted into place. It probably won't stop them for long.

Kalina: Should we counterattack?

Commander: These are the last few echelons we have. We can't afford to lose any more.

Commander: Dammit, will we have to mount a fighting retreat into the base's interior?

K: You must not fall back. We should still be able to deal with them as long as they're exposed.

Commander: I'm listening.

K: Do you have comms equipment?

Commander: All our long-range comms equipment was destroyed.

K: Short-range will do. You know that there's a Vympel unit not far away from the base, right?

Commander: I know, but will they help us?

K: That'll depend on how negotiations go.

K: Give me the radio and tune it to UHF 73.975, frequency hopping at 111 times per second. Use encryption mode 12.

Commander: Give it to him.

Kalina: Alright, the adjustments are complete.

Kalina: ...Are they really going to respond?

K: Let's just hope we can get through at all.

K: This is "Waterfall", do you copy?

...

The only sound that comes through the radio is white noise.

K: I repeat, this is "Waterfall", Please respond if you read me.

...

Kalina: No response, huh...

K glances at Kalina, who looks extremely anxious, and his grip tightens on the radio handset.

K: I repeat, this is "Waterfall", requesting assistance from Squad Cobalt-13 of Vympel 4th Detachment, do you copy? Over.

K: My ID code is DINV-RTSA-1239. This is an emergency transmission, please respond immediately if you copy. Over.

The white noise is cut short by an electronic sound, then a male voice speaks.

Cobalt-13: Cobalt-13 copies. Message received. Over.

K: Cobalt-13, Waterfall is requesting support. Enemy units are about to break through the defense zone and enter the restricted area. This is a severe threat to the success of our mission.

K: Requesting fire support. Over.

Cobalt-13: Negative. We do not have permission to fire. Over.

K: Cobalt-13, verify the urgency of the situation. The enemy's main armored unit is currently stalled in the built-up area. This is your last chance to provide fire support.

K: If the enemy succeeds in breaking through, they will constitute a severe threat to our mission.

K: Please notify your superiors. Over.

The radio goes silent for a brief moment.

Cobalt-13: Negative. I understand and sympathize with your situation, but you were already informed before the operation began that you would not receive fire support. Over.

K: Our team has obtained the "star". Our mission is to ensure the safety of the "star" at all costs.

K: The enemy armored units are severely impeding the progress of our mission. This is an emergency situation, please provide us with fire support immediately!

Cobalt-13: Cobalt-13 copies, but we are not authorized to open fire. Over.

K: God dammit! Then call your fucking superiors and ASK them, damned Ivan!

K: I am Major Kain Schwaben of the German Democratic Republic's Ministry for State Security; on behalf of the German Stasi, I request that the Soviets provide fire support for this operation!

K: Notify your superiors immediately! Over!

...

The despair-inducing white noise continues over the radio.

It only lasts a few seconds, but it feels like an eternity.

Cobalt-13: Cobalt-13 copies, we will relay this message to our superiors. Over.

K: Waterfall copies. Thank you.

Cobalt-13: Your request has been submitted. Please delay the enemy units for as long as possible. We are waiting for further instructions from Moscow.

Cobalt-13: We will contact you once we obtain permission to fire. Cobalt-13 out.

K puts down the radio handset. His eyes betray his genuine uncertainty of whether the fire support will come.

Commander: Stasi?

K: I know what you want to ask. I'll explain after it's all over.

Commander: I hope we'll live long enough to hear your explanation.

Commander: So we have to hold off the Military until we get a reply?

K: Correct. You must buy time for the bombardment.

K: That's your job, Commander.

Commander: Tsk... Kalina, how many combat-capable personnel do we have?

Kalina: If we push it, we can put a few echelons together, but...

Commander: Understood. Put me through to everyone.

Kalina: Okay...

The command display shows the surviving Dolls. Their fine features are now blackened by the soot and dust of the battlefield.

The only sound that interrupts the silence is the distant booming of the enemy's cannon fire.

The Commander doesn't have to say anything. They understand what is being asked of them, yet they still return the Commander's gaze with the same old smile.

The Commander closes their eyes and takes a deep breath. Then they open their eyes again and start assigning new missions and plotting new routes on the command tablet.

The Dolls immediately run to their designated locations. Everything is silent, save for the distant sounds of cannon fire and the howling frigid wind.

Finally, the Commander puts down the tablet. Only then do they realize that their fists are clenched so tightly that the knuckles have gone white.

K: ...

Commander: They're buying you the time you want, K.

Commander: Don't let them down.

K: ...I won't.
Part 10: Cutting

10

...

Ange: M4, do you copy?

Ange: I'm rushing over to the elevator. I should have command authority over you now. Are the other two members of DEFY with you?

M4A1: Ange? Thank goodness! The Commander's already contacted us. All the elite Dolls are headed over to your side.

M4A1: Dandelion is with us too.

Ange: Dandelion?

M4A1: She's an OGAS unit. Just think of her as an Elisa who's on our side.

M4A1: She can control S.F. units and provide us with support.

Dandelion: Miss Ange, there is little time to explain everything to you. All you need to know is that I will be helping you.

Dandelion: Also, I can hear the voices of those children. You have my gratitude.

Ange: I never thought a Nyto would be speaking so politely to me... I don't think anything else is going to surprise me today.

Ange: Never mind. We'll strategize on the move. With the forces at hand, we might actually have a chance to do this.

Ange: M4, what's your position?

M4A1: We're on the other side of the elevator, I'm sending you our coordinates now. The Military is headed in your direction. We'll try to move as fast as we can.

M4A1: Also, please be careful; it isn't just the Military and ourselves here.

Ange: What do you mean?

M4A1: I can sense Elisa. She's not far from here.

M4A1: S.F.'s remaining forces ought to be engaging the Military mechs. We can take advantage of their clash to find a window of opportunity.

Ange: S.F. also have their eyes fixed on the Starfish in the base. Be careful of M16; 404 has already fought her many times. She's sure to be in the depths of the base.

M4A1: ...I understand. We're all prepared for this.

M4A1: Also, I can faintly sense what she's doing. I'm not sure how to describe it, but she seems to be connecting to something vague and obscure.

Dandelion: I can sense it too. Elisa is probably trying to establish a connection with the Starfish. We don't have much time.

Ange: You're all just piling bad news after bad news on me.

Ange: Let's deal with the most immediate problem first. We'll try to get the Yegor situation under control. M4, you head down to the lowest level of the base and deal with S.F.

M4A1: Roger. I'll prepare myself.

AK-12: Quiet, Ange. The Military's here.

Ange: Our guests must be really impatient.

AK-12: The AR Team is sending over information on the Sangvis forces that Dandelion has gathered so far.

Ange: She's making herself useful, alright. Is S.F. also headed this way?

AK-12: Yup. They've brought the whole village along.

Ange: Then let's sit back and watch the show.

Thunk.

The elevator suddenly makes a deafening noise as the aged metal structure screeches to a halt.

The elevator's antique mechanical display refuses to move past the number "1".

Yegor: Look alive, Amber Flight. Looks like we won't be taking the elevator all the way to the bottom.

Adjutant: Yes, Captain!

The doors slowly open.

Naturally, there is already a welcoming party waiting for them.

???: Welcome, humans.

Two figures stand imperiously in the center of their forces, leering at the giant mechs.

Agent: I have brought Death to your doorstep.

Judge: Please accept your delivery!

On command, the S.F. Dolls begin shooting at the Military mechs.

Adjutant: Captain!

Yegor: Amber Flight, cover me. I'll crush them!

Adjutant: Yes, sir!
Part 11: Polishing

11

On the battlefield.

The melee in the built-up area near the base entrance has been going on for the past 15 minutes.

Every structure available has been used as cover, and the Dolls have blown up building after building in an attempt to block routes.

As they do their utmost to stop the enemy's advance, they are also searching for a chance to turn everything around.

The objective of this skirmish is the railway passage at the entrance. However, the past two Military offensives did not succeed.

The defending Dolls have quickly learned how to fight the Military during the previous battles. In addition, Dolls do not fear, and they do not tire. Other than their simulated emotions, they do not display any negative reactions. The advantage of being able to carry out orders under any circumstances soon becomes evident.

Meanwhile, morale on the other side is starting to plummet. None of the soldiers expected to pay so dearly for fighting against civilian Dolls from a PMC.

Armored Unit Commander: Haven't we seized the passage yet?!

Armored Unit Officer: We've lost too many of our infantry, and we can't push in with automatons alone.

Armored Unit Officer: There's rubble everywhere, so the attacking forces can't deploy their firepower and our vehicles can't get in.

Armored Unit Commander: Pizdets, can't we request another round of shelling?

Armored Unit Officer: It's too close to the base entrance. If we miss and destroy it by accident, we'll be playing into Griffin's hands.

Armored Unit Officer: We can't let ourselves be stalled here any longer; we need to catch up to Captain Yegor ASAP.

Armored Unit Officer: Let's go for another charge.

Armored Unit Officer: This is Zircon to Hematite. Slow your attack on the right flank for the moment and maintain pressure on the front. Over.

Military Officer: Hematite copies.

Armored Unit Commander: But the path on the left flank is blocked. Are we going to force our way through?

The officer does not reply. He simply gets back inside the cockpit.

Armored Unit Officer: Second platoon, follow my vehicle. The rest of you, break through on the left flank.

Armored Unit Commander: Yes, sir!

On Griffin's front.

M1 Garand's team has made use of a half-collapsed building to seal off the frontal approach. They are holding the final defense line along with one of the few remaining HOCs.

This HOC's equipment was long since destroyed, so the members are fighting alongside the others Dolls with small arms whose owners have perished.

SV-98: There's a half dozen infantrymen trying to approach us using cover! You can hit them from your position! We're leaving them to you!

M1918: Got it! Our teammates are already opening fire!

M1918: Garand, the enemy Typhons haven't made a move yet! This is our chance to plant more explosives!

M1 Garand: Roger!

A machine gun rattles in the distance, followed by more scattered fire. Garand and her team dart nimbly from cover to cover, trying to plant a simple IED on the road again.

M1 Garand: What a bunch of cowards! Are you too afraid to come at us head-on?!

Garand pokes her head out and flips off the enemies while she's at it.

Naturally, this causes bullets to rain down on her position, so she hurriedly ducks back inside.

M1 Garand: Hey, I was just mouthing off! Don't take everything so seriously!

M1 Garand: Type 88, are you done planting the explosives yet?

Type 88: Almost!

M1 Garand: If you don't hurry up, we'll have to blow ourselves up along with the enemies!

Type 88: Quit rushing me!

Type 88: My usual job is sweeping the floors, not planting high explosive charges!

M1 Garand: I don't usually go shooting at tanks with a firestick either!

M1 Garand: Stop complaining and remember to double the delay on the manual detonator, we want them to get halfway in before we blow them up!

Type 88: Relax, this is the third time you've said it!

M1918: M1 Garand, the enemy's approaching you again, you have to hurry!

M1 Garand: Got it, we'll be going right away!

BOOM!

Just then, an explosion erupts from the plaza.

Smoke billows out from the entrance of a distant workshop.

M1918: Are they coming from the right again??! Springfield! What happened? What's the situation?

Springfield: The enemy armored units are trying to use the wreckage to circle around us! They're planning to force their way to the entrance from on top of the rubble!

M1918: Can you hold out?

Springfield: There's too many of them. They might try to break though our suppressive fire!

M1918: Got it, Garand's team will come to back you up!

M1918: Got that, Garand?

M1918: Once you've planted the explosives, get over to Springfield ASAP, they can't hold out much longer!

M1 Garand: I know, I know! We'll be heading over right away!

Meanwhile.

In the temporary Griffin command post.

Kalina: Commander, the Military has launched a fourth offensive and Springfield's team has almost been wiped out.

Kalina: The other teams are doing their best to plug the opening, and they say they can still keep going.

Kalina: What should we do, Commander?

Commander: Um...

The Commander isn't sure how to respond. With the battle situation being what it is, there's no point in relaying tactics and commands from the rear anymore.

Even if the Dolls hold out to the last, the Military is still getting closer and closer, and there's no news about the fire support that they're counting on.

The Commander looks up at K, and K looks back at the Commander.

Neither of them says anything.

The Commander knows that other than waiting for Vympel to contact them, there is nothing K can do.

Commander: Have our forces hold out for another 5 minutes.

Kalina: Yes, Commander!

On the battlefield.

M1 Garand: Come on over, I'll cover you!

Bullets sweep the Military automatons that are trying to charge into the Dolls' cover.

Springfield: Yup! She's the last one.

Springfield supports a wounded Lee Enfield as they make their way across the open space back into their defensive position.

M1 Garand: Suppressive fire! Cover them as they approach us!

M1 Garand: Throw all the mortar bombs!

The HOC Dolls that have lost their mortar launchers throw the shells out from cover like they were hand grenades. Although the fragments can't destroy the Military automatons, the explosions disrupt their assault formation. The suppressive fire which follows halts their advance in its tracks.

M1 Garand: Dammit, I'm out. Does anyone have any .30-06 ammo left?

Type 88: I don't! I'm almost out of 8 mm myself!

M1 Garand: Look out! Incoming!

Boom!

As if to validate Garand's words, a cannon shell strikes the building she's in and leaves a large hole in the wall.

After that, more bullets come in through the hole that's been made.

M1 Garand: Miss Springfield! Fall back with the wounded personnel! Leave this place to us!

Springfield: But your ammo...

M1 Garand: We'll be waiting to enjoy your coffee when we get back, and even if we don't have ammo, we still have our bayonets.

M1 Garand: Everyone! Fix bayonets!

Type 88: How about a dadao?

M1 Garand: Use your teeth if you want! Anything works as long as it can stop them!

Hanyang Type 88 grips her dadao in her hands and ignites the thrusters on her back.

M1 Garand: You look like you could take on an entire division by yourself.

Type 88: But of course!

M1 Garand: Alright, leave this place to us, Miss Springfield!

M1 Garand: Besides, the casualties will only get in the way if they stay here.

M1 Garand: Wait a minute, emergency comms?

Type 88: New orders from the Commander?

M1 Garand: Our defense mission is over. The Commander wants everyone to fall back to the base immediately!

Type 88: Has help come at last?

Type 88: I wish I could watch these bastards get blown sky high with my own eyes.

M1 Garand: That's enough nonsense out of you. Let's get out of here before we get blasted into scrap!

Almost at the same time, at the temporary command post inside the base.

The Commander nervously watches the indicators showing the position of each Doll as they maintain the tenuous balance of the defense line.

Kalina assigns resources and adjusts comm frequencies without a pause.

All this is interrupted by a burst of static from the radio in front of K.

For a moment, everyone freezes. All eyes are on the handset that K is holding.

K immediately puts the call through and listens to the voice coming from the handset with bated breath.

Cobalt-13: This is Cobalt-13. Waterfall, respond. Over.

K: Waterfall copies, go ahead.

Cobalt-13: Moscow has granted permission for the air strike and the bombers are in attack position. You have five minutes to direct fire. Please send the coordinates as soon as possible. Over.

K: Waterfall copies. Thank you. Please hold. Over.

K exhales heavily, as though a great weight has been lifted off him. He turns to look at the Commander.

K: Give me the attack coordinates.

Commander: Have them attack a 200-meter radius from the intersection of Highway 183 and the railway station to the base entrance.

The Commander's reply is instantaneous.

K: That's danger close... Are you sure?

Commander: We have no choice.

K nods. He understands that this is a very difficult decision to make.

K: Have your Dolls fall back straight away. I'll try to buy you as much time as I can.

The Commander nods and issues the order to the echelons with Kalina's help.

K: This is Waterfall. Bombing coordinates are all surface targets at 8472 6543. Over.

Cobalt-13: This is Cobalt-13, we can see Griffin forces within the blast radius. Please verify. Over.

Kalina nods to the Commander. The Commander pauses, then holds up two fingers to K.

K: Affirmative. We will evacuate the location within two minutes. Requesting danger close bombing. Over.

Cobalt-13: Acknowledged. The bombing will commence in 120 seconds. Good luck. Cobalt-13 out.

Far in the distance, on the battlefield.

Vympel Commander: I have to hand it to those Dolls for sticking it out for so long.

Vympel Commander: I don't know if I should praise their resilience or roast our troops for degenerating into such an unsightly state.

Vympel Commander: They want to take on the West when they can't even beat a bunch of toys. No wonder the brass wants to be rid of them.

Vympel Commissar: Is Griffin still holding out? Please let me take a look, Comrade Major.

The Vympel officer hands the binoculars to his commissar.

Through the binoculars, he sees that the thoroughly wrecked interior of the base and fires everywhere.

Explosions erupt over and over again from the Griffin positions. The smoke grenades that the Dolls have thrown out almost completely obscure all vision, but he can be sure that they are falling back to the entrance at full speed.

Vympel Commander: What do you think, Comrade Commissar?

Vympel Commissar: It is most impressive. They are tenacious - tenacious enough to alter our mission.

Vympel Commissar: Still, they are nothing more than a civilian PMC. It's only a matter of time before they're all wiped out.

Vympel Commander: Right, turn all the cameras off.

Vympel Commissar: Didn't they say they wouldn't be providing any support?

Vympel Commissar: Did the Chief change his mind?

Vympel Commander: Moscow already sanctioned the air strike. The objective is to exterminate all the surface forces of the rebel army.

Vympel Commissar: And they're doing this just to save a single PMC?

Vympel Commander: It seems Statesec has an arrangement with the Germans, and the agent they sent found something that the brass is interested in.

Vympel Commissar: That's an excellent political reason.

Vympel Commissar: But in that case, won't the evidence we're recording be marred?

Vympel Commander: Thanks to the Dolls' fortitude, we've captured enough footage of their limbs being blasted in all directions. We can let the bigshots in the central authority worry about the rest.

Vympel Commissar: Understood. I've ordered all squads to switch off the surface and drone cameras.

Two minutes later, a point of light rapidly descends, striking the last Military armored train. A massive fireball swells up, consuming the gigantic rail vehicle as if it were nothing but a toy and throwing countless fragments into the sky.

Such is the effect of a surface detonation of the 1,500kg cruise missile originally intended for ripping open the underground structure of the submarine base.

More points of light splinter mid-air into a zillion little motes that finally hit the ground. A series of explosions can be heard from the base, which is completely engulfed by smoke and dust.

The Vympel officer puts down his binoculars and stuffs them back into his backpack. There's no need to verify the detonation of those terminal-sensitive projectiles.

Vympel Commander: Let's get ready. It's about time to wrap this up.

Vympel Commissar: Understood, Comrade Major.
Part 12: Silvering

12

...

At the Griffin temporary command post.

The bombing sounds like it will never end.

Their bunker stands in silence, trembling along with the rest of the world.

Commander: How many Dolls made it back?

Kalina: Only half of them. They're pinned down by enemy pursuers and can't shake them off!

Commander: What a bunch of clingy bastards...

Kalina: Our forces are scattered and the base is in chaos...

Commander: Intercept them from our bunker! We mustn't let them link up with Yegor!

Angelia: What happened? I heard the explosions from over here.

Commander: We had the air force conduct a bombing run. The Military's surface forces should be finished, but some of them managed to flee into the base.

Angelia: Tsk... Yegor's mechs are a pain in the ass. Fortunately they're busy fighting S.F. right now.

Angelia: I have a plan to wipe them all out in one fell swoop, but I'll need your help.

Commander: Go ahead.

Angelia: I infiltrated this sub base by sea. There are four valves which lead to the ocean.

Angelia: If we can pin down their mechs on the first floor and blow all four valves at the same time, we can drown them in seawater and Yegor will be fish food.

Angelia: I'll send you the location of the seawater valves. They're all located on the surface level of the base. If we're defeated here, then please blow the valves. 404 is heading towards you right now; they should be able to give you some assistance.

Commander: What about you?

Angelia: We can't let the enemy have their way, no matter who they are.

Commander: ...

Commander: I understand.

The transmission ends.

Kalina: Commander, what are you doing?

Kalina: Why are you putting on your bulletproof vest...?

Kalina: Wait, you're taking your backpack and pistol too? Hang on, isn't that...

Commander: As you can see, it's the one Kryuger gave me.

Kalina: I'm not talking about the gun. Where are you going?

Commander: You heard Angelia.

Kalina: But the Dolls haven't returned yet! You can't go in on your own! It's too dangerous!

Commander: I know. That's why I'm not going alone.

Commander: K, take this.

K: Remote-detonated explosives?

Commander: It shouldn't be a problem, right, Major Schwaben? I trust this mission should be a piece of cake for you.

K: Please, I've had more training than you've had meals.

K sneers as he loads the explosives into his backpack. Then he picks up his weapon and gives it a quick check.

Commander: I'm not the one who got KO-ed before the fighting even started.

K: I don't cower behind Dolls all the time, unlike you.

Kalina: Wait... Don't tell me you're going to...

Commander: Yup, that's exactly what we're going to do. Good thing I didn't skip a single tactical training lesson.

Commander: These are the coordinates we received from Ange. We'll take two each. You can handle it, right?

K: Got it.

Kalina: Wait a minute... Wait a minute, both of you!

Kalina: Commander, I'll...!

Commander: You'll what?

Kalina: Give me one too.

Commander: What are you talking about?

She holds out her hand and repeats what she interrupted me to say.

Kalina: Give me one too! I'll deal with one site for you!

Commander: No. You stay here.

This logistics officer who always has a brilliant smile does not belong on such a dangerous battlefield. Yet she has gone through hell and high water by my side more times than I could count.

I cannot and WILL NOT ask her to endanger herself for me again.

Commander: If any Dolls come back, someone will need to give them orders and resupply them.

Commander: Someone has to man the command post. This is a very important duty.

Commander: Do you understand, Kalin?

Kalina: I...

Commander: This is an order. I need someone to help me gather up the surviving Dolls.

She holds my gaze in silence. Then she nods solemnly.

I can see the tears welling up in her eyes, but all I can do is turn away and feign nonchalance.

Commander: Alright, let's head out. But make sure we all come back alive!
Part 13: Virtual Image Reforging

    13chevron_right

...

In front of the main elevator.

Boom! Boom!

The shockwaves from the explosions can be felt even deep below the base.

However, that doesn't stop the Sangvis Dolls and the mechs from killing each other. Countless S.F. units block the mechs' advance.

Yegor: Terra to Zircon. Zircon, do you copy? Zircon, do you copy?!

Adjutant: I can't contact Hematite either, Captain.

Yegor: Damn air force, have they already made their move?

Adjutant: Captain... Let us handle these S.F. units. Please break out of the encirclement. We don't have much time left.

Yegor: ...

Adjutant: You need to complete the mission for the sake of our comrades.

Yegor: Amber 2, Amber 3, you're under the command of Amber 1. Crush the enemy and link up with me ASAP!

Pilot: Yes, sir!

Adjutant: All Amber units! Depress your missiles and fire at 3 o'clock! Clear a path for the Captain!

Judge: Stop them!

The S.F. Dolls rush towards them at maximum speed, attempting to fence off the enemy.

However, dozens of missiles explode among the Sangvis Dolls, forcing open a path among them.

Yegor's mech rides the shockwave of the explosion as it surges out at top speed. The only one who can stand in his way now is Judge.

Yegor: This is my final gift for you! Take it, puppets!

There is no need to aim and certainly no need to slow down. The mech hits the tiny Doll at full velocity.

Judge is sent flying like a rag doll and crashes heavily into the wall of the passage.

Agent: Judge!

Adjutant: Where are you looking, Doll?!

Agent: Ugh!

The Sinner's plasma cannon begins to glow.

However, a shell explodes in front of the cockpit before it can fire.

M4 wields the firing platform that she received from M16 as she stands at a high vantage point.

M4A1: Ange, we're currently engaging them in battle.

M4A1: Our weapons can't damage these mechs at all, but we can just about slow them down!

Ange: Alright. We'll stick to the plan and split them up before destroying them piecemeal. We still have a chance to win!

M4A1: Understood! I'll try to draw those wingmen off!

M4 SOPMOD II: Die!

ST AR-15: Aim for the legs and the cockpit!

RO635: Got it!

M4A1: Ange, go after Yegor! Leave this place to us!

Ange: Got it!

Ange: 12! 94! With me!

Ange picks up her handset and shouts into it.

Ange: RPK-16! Head straight to the second level! Yegor's broken through the encirclement!

Elsewhere, M4's heavy-firepower shell might not have penetrated the cockpit of the mech, but it almost caused the mech itself to stall out.

The officer piloting it understands that he's positioned very badly - his machine is caught in the perfect spot for a pincer attack from the Griffin ambushers.

They must have identified him as the one in command here to have opted for this maneuver.

Adjutant: Amber 2, cover me! We'll pull back to the elevator and regroup!

Pilot: Yes, sir!

Amber 1 evades several grenades fired at its legs.

Just as they're about to enter the elevator, there is a massive explosion.

A blinding glow of blue-white light engulfs the location where the elevator should have been. The mech is thrown high into the air, then crashes heavily back to the ground.

???: Did they all perish in the end? You can't count on S.F. for anything.

RO635: Is that...

RO turns, and the stiff look on M4's face confirms her suspicion.

The one who spoke is none other than...

???: It's been a while, my friends.

Beneath the bluish radiance, the white-haired Doll finally appears before her former teammates.

M16A1: We meet at last, Lunasia.

Bremen Suburbs, Germany.

Bremen is an important city within the decontaminated zone in East Germany.

Since WWIII, the government has implemented many policies aimed at preserving the city's diversity and promoting continuous development, which has attracted a large influx of immigrants.

The government initially proposed different schemes to address this issue, but the city's limited resources simply cannot cope with the excess population, so a significant floating population is forced to reside in the refugee camps, struggling to make ends meet.

These refugees displaced from contaminated zones are desperate for land on which to survive, and the local government has clearly underestimated their desperation. Even to this day, many homeless refugees still flock to Bremen to take their chances.

The border entrance is teeming with people.

Not everyone gets to become a resident of Bremen - even a simple shack in the refugee settlement is extremely hard to come by.

All immigrants, refugee or not, have to undergo vigorous vetting procedures just to enter Bremen.

Those who do not carry a travel pass issued by the government will not be allowed to travel to the other side of the quarantine wall, even if they have crossed the quarantine belt.

Angelia: ...

Refugee: ...Oh, sorry for bumping into you.

Angelia: That's alright. Please go ahead.

Refugee: M-May I?

Angelia: Sure.

Angelia: I'm waiting for someone.

Angelia's voice is unusually gentle.

Angelia has been standing at the checkpoint under the scorching sun for 15 minutes, all the while letting people from behind take her place in the queue.

She is dressed like a destitute beggar and wrapped up thoroughly to cover up her ghastly scars.

She does not wish to attract any kind of attention. Fortunately, her appearance is not all that uncommon even in this summer heat.

People in this day and age have all sorts of reasons to obscure their bodies.

Angelia: (...Only two left?)

The queue at the checkpoint is not moving very quickly, but it is moving nonetheless.

The crowd hasn't been deliberately organized, but everything is proceeding in an orderly fashion, which is a sign of competent management.

The people around Ange have come and gone.

Which makes the two men loitering like her all the more conspicuous.

Angelia: (They don't seem to be armed... Are they not taking me seriously?)

Angelia: (Or are firearms just hard to conceal in a place like this?)

Ange raises her arm and knocks on the railings next to her. The clang is drowned out by the bustling crowd and her odd gesture has gone unnoticed.

But the men that she has her eyes on are visibly unnerved by the "signal" that they think she just sent, and their wandering gaze zeros in on her at the same time, even if just for an instant.

Angelia: ...Good morning.

Ange meets their eyes.

The two men flinch and look away at the same time - the worst mistake to make when following someone is to arouse the target's suspicion; that's basic stalking technique, and it is this conditioned reflex that Ange is exploiting.

The moment they shift their gaze, Ange immediately pulls down her hood and ducks into the crowd.

It only takes the blink of an eye for her stalkers to realize their target has disappeared from sight, but for an agent as experienced as Ange, this tiny amount of time is more than enough.

Agent A: Crap!

Realizing their serious blunder, the men waste no time and spring into action immediately.

However, the noisy and tightly-packed crowd poses a challenging obstacle.

Even the well-trained agents cannot pass through them easily.

Agent A: We've lost her!

Agent B: Split up!

Agent B: We've got to find her! Don't let her enter the city!

The Bremen soldiers standing guard at the checkpoint do not seem to have noticed the small commotion.

This is good news for both Ange and her unwelcomed pursuers, since none of them wants the situation to get out of hand.

As if by some kind of tacit agreement, both sides are doing their best to keep a low profile even though tension is running extremely high.

Angelia: (...Which means...)

Angelia: (They're not from the city then?)

That makes sense - if they were from Bremen, they could have waited until she was inside the city.

Ange knows that the entire world is watching her every move, and yet she has put herself in danger once again.

She's just reckless like that.

Agent A: Where the hell did she go...

Agent A: Urk!

One of the agents is searching in the crowd when a pair of powerful arms lock around his neck.

Swifty, silently, and completely oblivious to his assailant's deadly presence, he is overcome almost instantaneously.

Agent A: Hm! Hnng!

Unable to even make a sound, his face flushes like a tomato about to burst. In a few seconds, he loses consciousness and collapses onto the ground.

Child Refugee: ...??

Angelia: ...Hush.

Ange smiles at the gawking child and gestures for him to keep quiet.

The boy, with snot dangling from his nose, turns and runs back to his mother. He keeps looking back at Ange, but his mother simply urges him to keep up with the crowd.

The incident seems to have gone largely unnoticed. Even if there are witnesses, nobody would stop for this.

It does not affect their livelihood, after all.

By the time the other agent realizes that he has lost contact with his colleague, Ange has once again vanished among the flock of refugees.

Agent B: Schneider!

Agent B: Verdammt... This woman is as slippery as an eel!

A sudden thought sends chills running down his spine.

They are meant to be the hunters, but the tables have turned in just a few short minutes.

This is utterly inconceivable to him.

Agent B: I thought she was just some stupid bitch who's dumb enough to come alone.

Agent B: Turns out she's no joke... Scheiße! She's totally toying with us!

Cursing is not going to solve his problem. Right now, it's imperative that he finds this damnable woman from within the crowd.

The traffic is hindering his movements; it shouldn't be any different for her.

He is also an elite who has survived hellish training. He could have easily subdued her if he could just get a little closer...

That is how it should have played out.

Agent B: Hng!

Bam!

The agent finally breaks free from the crowd. Just as he is about to turn the corner...

A punch lands squarely on the bridge of his nose.

Angelia: What a joke. You're too careless. You should always be prepared for your target to counterattack, you know?

Agent B: D-Dammit!

The indignant agent retaliates, but Ange dodges his blow nonchalantly.

Angelia: Who are you? Who sent you?

Agent B: Cut the crap and go to hell!

Ignoring his threat, Ange seizes the opportunity and delivers a heavy blow to the man's face with a crescent kick.

The kick sends his shades flying and knocks the agent down before he can even gasp.

Ange lowers her leg and inspects the man, who is lying in a crumpled pile on the ground. Once she is certain that he is out cold, she lets herself relax a little.

Angelia: Just two? This is too easy.

Agent C: Arms in the air.

Angelia: ...Have I missed something?

Angelia: And here I was just wondering.

Just as Ange is about to stand up, a third man comes out of nowhere and points a pistol straight at her.

Angelia: I thought you didn't think firearms would be necessary.

Agent C: We clearly underestimated you.

Agent C: It would be wise for you to come quietly with me.

Angelia: Really?

Angelia: I believe it would be wise for YOU to just leave quietly.

Ange retorts, completely unperturbed.

Agent C: I don't think so.

???: You will when you wake up.

Agent C: Wha—?!

Thud!

The man takes a blow in the back of his neck. Ange swears she could hear the crack of broken bone.

Without even a chance to pull the trigger, the agent topples over.

Ange looks placidly at her partners, who have approached without a sound.

Angelia: I hope he's not dead.

AN-94: I held back.

RPK-16: Hm, somehow I don't think this gentleman's spine agrees.

RPK-16: Oh, what a shame. He's still breathing.

Angelia: Drag him into the alley back there. Get the other two as well.

RPK-16: What would you have done if we hadn't shown up in time?

RPK-16: Why didn't you let us stay with you? Don't you know it's very dangerous to split up even for just a few minutes?

Angelia: If I were him, I'd have been relieved that you hadn't shown up in time. After all, he wouldn't have had to stay so long in the hospital if I had taken him down myself.

AN-94: Miss Ange wants to eliminate the spies who have been following her before we enter the city, that's why she had to bait them into revealing themselves.

AN-94: They wouldn't have fallen for it if we had been with her.

RPK-16: Not that they're very professional, seeing that they fell for it at all.

RPK-16: I expected more from the Germans.

Angelia: They don't seem to be sent by the government, and they're too weak to be Paradeus.

Angelia: It's probably just some random gang messing about. We shouldn't waste time on such amateurs.

Angelia: Still, we weren't actually followed by that many people, so I suppose our disguises are working pretty well.

RPK-16: Is this why you've split the team up?

AN-94: Though I am a bit puzzled by the grouping...

RPK-16: Oh? Got something against me, dear Antje?

AN-94: ...S-Stop pulling my leg, Renate.

Angelia: I'm asking you to be sisters because it's easier to disguise the two of you as civilians entering the city.

Angelia: This is Germany; we're not here on holiday.

Angelia: We must keep a low profile on this mission.

RPK-16: That's true; those two stick out like sore thumbs even in civilian clothing.

RPK-16: Is that also why you've given us weird-ass names?

Angelia: Are they weird?

Angelia: I think they suit you.

RPK-16: So Miss 94 is "gracious" and I'm "reborn"?

RPK-16: Your way of naming people sure is straightforward.

Angelia: Remember to address each other by your aliases once you're in.

RPK-16: Shouldn't we wait for the two who look like actual sisters?

Angelia: You'll see when we get inside.

With the nuisance taken care of, the reunited trio join the crowd once again and enter the town leading into Bremen.

The quarantine wall towers above the huddling slipshod buildings. Residents of this town sometimes look up and watch as large metal birds soar through the sky, directly across the satellite town and into Bremen.

AN-94: We're through.

AN-94: Where is our informant?

Angelia: We'll meet him after we rendezvous with Lucia and Erwin.

Angelia: Now that we're in Bremen, we should be safe for the time being.

RPK-16: You mean 12 and 15? I just can't get used to these names.

Angelia: You'll get used to them soon enough.

AN-94: This is the first time I've visited East Germany.

AN-94: I didn't expect it to be like this.

Angelia: Getting a sense of novelty?

Angelia: Things aren't really that different from back home.

AN-94: Hm... You're right.

AN-94: Most of the refugees at the checkpoint will only get to live in this satellite town.

Angelia: Even so, it's more than they could hope for.

Angelia: It certainly beats living in fear and being doused in radiation out in the Yellow Zone.

Angelia: It's the same for people everywhere.

RPK-16: I'm surprised you two are in the mood for idle chatter. Don't you think we're standing out a bit too much?

RPK-16: Also, we've been here for a while, but there's no sign of Erwin or Lucia.

RPK-16: Are you sure they actually know where we're meeting up?

Angelia: Yes, they simply haven't arrived.

AN-94: Then maybe we should've waited before coming in?

AN-94: It's a lot of trouble crossing the quarantine belt without your papers, not to mention that they're Dolls.

Angelia: Relax, 94, they'll be fine.

Angelia: Also, it's about time.

AN-94: About time?

Ange glances at her watch.

By then, the trio have made their way to a large open field.

This is a piece of undeveloped land between the quarantine belt and the satellite town.

RPK-16: An open space, but I'm not seeing any paths.

RPK-16: Oh, I know. 12 and 15 are gonna pop out from underground?

Angelia: Guess again.

RPK-16: ...Oh, now I see.

RPK-16 seems to have come to some kind of realization.

RPK-16: No wonder you put them on the same team.

AN-94: W-What do you mean?

Angelia: There they are.

Ange looks up in the other direction.

A freighter plane is approaching Bremen from the horizon.

In their field of vision, the small black dot gradually grows into a rumbling aircraft.

Its silhouette blocks out the sunlight. Ange gazes at it with squinted eyes.

The plane becomes larger and larger as it descends, until they can clearly see the landing gear being lowered.

Ange keeps staring wordlessly at the sky.

All of a sudden, a small object is ejected from the rear of the plane. The object enlarges rapidly and it soon becomes apparent that it's a crate about the size of a car.

With a loud, dull clang, the crate lands heavily not far from Ange.

The empty weedy field now sports an additional crater.

Angelia: They've arrived.

AN-94: Huh?

Ange walks up to the crate and disengages the locking mechanism.

The crate opens on the side and two white-haired Dolls roll out from within.

AN-94: 12...Lucia, are you alright?

AK-12: My head...felt like it was going to come right off.

Angelia: The landing site is only off by 4.75m. The delivery crew is really professional.

RPK-16: So this is how you made it across the border.

RPK-16: Hahahaha... I'm sorry, but this is hilarious.

RPK-16: I can't believe you actually agreed to this. What obliging subordinates you are.

AK-15: ...It is efficient.

AK-12: I don't mind being cooped up in a crate for hours.

AK-12: But at least equip the crate with a parachute for the landing, for goodness sake.

Angelia: We can't have anyone snapping pictures of it. Besides, you're the one who came up with this plan·

Angelia: "AK-15 and I have no chance of slipping in unnoticed."

Angelia: "So rather than crossing the border on foot, it's better if we go by plane."

Angelia: That's what you said.

AK-12: This wasn't exactly how I planned to disembark from the plane.

Angelia: It worked out just fine in the end.

Angelia: Your weapons and comms equipment all survived the fall, right?

AK-15: We stashed them in the buffer container before setting off. They appear to be undamaged, but I will double-check.

RPK-16: It couldn't have been easy to smuggle you aboard a plane even if you're in a crate.

RPK-16: So who was the kind benefactor that made such arrangements for us?

RPK-16: Since everybody is present, isn't it about time you spilled the beans?

Angelia: Do I really have to spell it out?

RPK-16: Oh? I honestly don't remember meeting anyone with such influence.

...

Inside the quarantine wall.

RPK-16: I honestly don't remember meeting anyone with such influence.

K: What's going on?

K: Am I to be greeted by an insult on arrival?

The person here to pick up Angelia and co. is none other than K, who returned to his home country after concluding his intelligence mission at the submarine base.

It is also thanks to K that Ange carries a travel pass issued by the East German government.

Angelia: Cut the crap.

Angelia: How are the preparations?

K: The safe house is ready, and I've sorted out your fake IDs.

K: Still, I've never met someone who's so damn brazen when asking for a favor...

Angelia: Right now, there are enough people who want to do me favors to form a queue from here all the way to St. Petersburg.

Angelia: Not to mention you owe me one.

K: What a pain in the ass. And here I thought we were allies.

Angelia: That was in the past.

Angelia: We've agreed that the East German government won't meddle in our operations.

Angelia: That naturally means that you should also keep your nose out of our business.

K: I know, but I have my own obligations.

K: On a personal level, I don't mind helping you, but this is Germany, and I'm in charge of national security here.

K: It is my duty—and well within my right—to know what you're up to.

Angelia: Humph... Surely you could guess even if I didn't say anything?

Angelia: My objective here is no big secret.

K: "Investigate Paradeus." We have a common objective.

K: Since we've already been conducting the investigation for a while, your best option would be to collaborate with us.

Angelia: I don't need any collaborators. What if you're also working for William?

K: If I were, you wouldn't have left the submarine base alive.

K: C'mon, don't be so belligerent at our reunion. Let me introduce you to some new friends.

K leads Ange and her Dolls through the wall into Bremen proper.

A black sedan is parked on one side of the road. It seems to have been waiting for a while.

By the car stands a charming-looking woman. She waves warmly at K and his guests.

???: Oh, over here!

Angelia: That's one of your so-called new friends?

K: I'm sure you'll get along just fine.

???: It's been a while, Herr Schwaben.

???: Thank you for your work in Paldiski.

K: Just doing my job.

K: Here, introductions are in order. This is Angelia.

???: Oh hello, Frau Angelia! Fancy some candy?

The woman fishes out a packet of candy from her handbag and passes one to Ange.

Ange accepts the candy but seems to have no intention of eating it.

Morridow: I am Morridow Voigt, Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary.

Morridow: Just call me Morridow.

Angelia: ...Ulrich?

Angelia: THE Ulrich in Belgrade?

K: Yes, the very same.

Angelia: What has this got to do with her?

K: To put it simply, her assistance was indispensable in getting you here.

K: Before we bring you to the safe house, you have to meet her.

K: It is her request.

Morridow: Precisely. Please get in, Frau Ange.

Morridow: No need to be afraid, it will be just a simple meeting!

Angelia: ...

Angelia: Your car doesn't look big enough for all of us.

Morridow: Herr K will escort all your Dolls to the safe house first.

Morridow: The Chairwoman only has business with you.

Angelia: I see.

Angelia: Renate, go with Erwin and Antje.

Angelia: Lucia, get in the car.

Morridow: Huh? The Chairwoman would only like to...

AK-12: I'm coming, end of story. Let's be friends, Miss Morridow.

Morridow: ...I understand.

Morridow: Then if you'd please.
Part 2

Bremen City Hall, Germany.

The black sedan slowly comes to a stop at a reserved parking spot. The woman dressed as a secretary gets out first and hurries to open the door for her passengers in the back seat.

But before she can do that, they have already disembarked on their own.

Angelia: ...

AK-12: Have you had dealings with this Chairwoman Ulrich before?

Angelia: No, I've never even met her.

Angelia: But I've heard about what she did in Belgrade.

Angelia: Including the things she went through with the Commander.

AK-12: Do you think she can be trusted?

Angelia: I will reserve my judgment. But we have free rein here only because she's given us the green light.

Angelia: I really can't draw any conclusions until I actually meet her.

AK-12: I see~

Morridow: Frau Ange, this way please!

AK-12: How attentive of you, Miss Secretary. It must be tough doing this kind of work.

Morridow: Not at all... I love my work.

Morridow: I have always aspired to serve Frau Ulrich and contribute to her cause, no matter how insignificant my contribution may be.

Morridow: I firmly believe that her ideology will guide mankind onto the right path as we struggle to survive in this hostile world.

Morridow: I am happy to tend to the frivolities behind the scenes, and I freely admit that I'm merely parroting her views.

Angelia: Sounds like you have a lot of respect for your employer.

Morridow: My employer is my country; Frau Ulrich is simply my superior.

Morridow: Still, I feel extremely lucky to be given the opportunity to work under her. She is truly deserving of respect.

AK-12: How surprising.

AK-12: I've been working with Angelia for such a long time I've almost forgotten there are actually good people in the world.

Angelia: Watch your tongue while we're in there.

Angelia: I don't want to get kicked out before we can even start doing our job.

...

Knock knock.

Morridow: Frau Ulrich, it's me.

Morridow: Frau Angelia is here.

Ulrich: Please come in.

...

Ulrich: ...Frau Angelia, it's a pleasure.

Angelia: Hello, just call me Ange.

Ulrich: And this must be AK-12.

Ulrich: I have heard much about you. You are considered quite the exceptional paragon even among Tactical Dolls.

AK-12: Hahahaha, you are incredibly forthright.

AK-12: But you might want to call me Lucia for now.

Ulrich: Lucia?

Angelia: That's her alias while we're operating in Germany.

Ulrich: I see. So the Wolf Pack is also here.

Morridow: A-Apologies, Frau Ulrich...

Morridow: I did say Frau Ange was the only one you wanted to see...

Ulrich: No need to apologize. Frau Ange is in a very precarious situation; her caution is totally understandable.

Ulrich: Not to mention I am a complete stranger.

Angelia: Thank you for your understanding and support.

Ulrich: It is simply a mutually-beneficial arrangement, Frau Ange.

Ulrich: We also have much to gain from your operation.

Ulrich: We have every reason to see to your success.

Angelia: So what do you want with me?

Angelia: Frankly speaking, I sneaked into Bremen through border security as a legitimate refugee.

Angelia: I'm in no state to be talking to you in a place like this.

Angelia: I don't mind making this trip, but I claim no responsibility for soiling your pristine office.

Ulrich: Please forgive me. I understand you are unhappy that you've been brought here against your wishes.

Ulrich: I should have gone and welcomed you in person.

Ulrich: However, I'm afraid I am not currently in the position to do that.

Ulrich: As you surely know, right now this office is being watched very closely.

Angelia: ...Because of what happened at the submarine base.

Ulrich: As a key participant of that operation, I believe your superior must have sent you here to share some information with us?

Angelia: Unfortunately, I no longer have a superior.

Ulrich: Which is why you're the one standing in my office and not anyone else.

Angelia: You should know that I don't give away intelligence for free.

Angelia: There is also something I want. This collaboration can only proceed if I get something of equal value in return.

Ulrich: That's alright, I did not expect you to divulge anything today.

Ulrich: I simply wanted to have a chat with you in person out of common courtesy.

Angelia: You have achieved your goal even if we talk about nothing. You just needed me to sit here for several minutes.

Ulrich: After all, a lot of eyes are on you.

Ulrich: I ask for your understanding. Think of it as a politician's customary tactic.

Angelia: I only agreed to come because the Commander thinks pretty highly of you.

Angelia: If you truly live up to your reputation, then surely you cannot abide by William's crimes?

Ulrich: Naturally.

Angelia: Alright, I hope you'll prove that through your actions.

Ulrich: I will give you whatever assistance I am in the position to give.

Angelia: In exchange, I will provide you with intelligence once my objective is completed.

Ulrich: Wonderful.

Ulrich: But even if you didn't, I would still help you.

Angelia: Why?

Ulrich: There are far too few kind-hearted people in the world.

Ulrich: No matter how hard you try to feign indifference, you cannot really hide your true nature.

Ulrich: You and the commander that saved me both strike me as the rare sort of people who still possess kindness.

Ulrich: It is my belief that the world will be a better place with more people like you.

Ulrich: Our mission isn't to catch one or two bad guys, but to change this evil-infested world and remake the rules that govern it.

Angelia: "A shining beacon in a brave new world"...eh?

Angelia: But I must warn you—it does take power to change the world, but power that's beyond your control will eventually be your demise.

Angelia: I hope you will not repeat my country's mistake.

Ulrich: I will remember your counsel.

Angelia: Now I can see why you were sent to Belgrade.

Ulrich: I'm flattered.

Ulrich: Morridow, escort Frau Ange to her residence.

Morridow: Uh... Right! Understood!

Ulrich: Oh... One more thing.

Knock knock.

Ulrich: Come in, please.

???: ...Ma'am.

A man of imposing stature enters the office.

???: Anything I can do for you, Madam Chairwoman?

Ulrich: Angelia, Herr Hopps will be in charge of your safety during your time in Bremen.

Angelia: I won't run away.

Ulrich: This really is just for the sake of your personal safety.

AK-12: Hahahaha, you Germans have such a great sense of humor!

Hopps: ...I am Hopps, Protection Officer.

Ulrich: Hopps is a retired GSG 9 officer and has been working for me for almost a year.

Ulrich: He has seen real combat and is very dependable; you can count on him.

Ulrich: In terms of performance in combat, he obviously can't compare with your Dolls.

Ulrich: But it's better to let a human handle things in the city.

Ulrich: Also, feel free to entrust Morridow with other errands.

Ulrich: I know it is rather difficult for you to navigate our city, where everything is new and unfamiliar.

Morridow: At your service!

Ulrich: She knows the city very well and will be able to help you in all kinds of matters.

AK-12: She does sound pretty useful, Ange.

Angelia: Alright.

Ulrich: In that case, I wish you a happy and fruitful time in Bremen.

Angelia: Thanks.

Angelia: And please bear with us if we cause any trouble.

Ulrich: ...I'll keep that in mind.

...

Morridow: Frau Ange, allow me to escort you to the safe house.

Morridow: Herr Hopps, are you coming with us?

Hopps: ...My mission is to ensure Frau Ange's personal safety while she is out and about in Bremen.

Hopps: At the same time, I have been asked to keep out of her way in day-to-day life.

Angelia: How very thoughtful of the chairwoman... So are you coming or not?

Hopps: If you'll allow me to accompany you.

Angelia: Lucia, get in the car.

...

A few minutes later, at the temporary outpost prepared by Ulrich.

Morridow: It's a bit messy, but it is definitely secure.

Morridow: Hopps and I will be waiting outside. Please call us if you need anything.

With that, Morridow leaves the briefing room and closes the door behind her.

AN-94: Ange.

Angelia: Hm...

Angelia: Where's K?

AN-94: Mr. K left shortly after he had brought us here.

AN-94: He seemed to have other important matters to attend to.

AK-15: ...How did the discussion go?

Angelia: There wasn't really much of a discussion.

Angelia: This is only day one; we'll be here for a long time.

AK-12: I do hope it will go smoothly.

AK-12: Unfortunately, from what I can tell, some things are beyond even the chairwoman's control.

Angelia: Ulrich isn't the chancellor of Germany. Just be happy that she genuinely wants to help.

Angelia: According to my sources, quite a lot of people have opposing views even in Bremen alone.

Angelia: Governments are never as cohesive as they make themselves out to be.

AK-12: People are the same everywhere, eh?

Angelia: If pointless strife is reduced by even 10%, the world will become a paradise.

Angelia: In any case, we have more immediate things to worry about. Don't forget why we've come all this way to Germany.

AK-15: How should we proceed?

Angelia: Now that we have a way of navigating the city, we can focus on the operation.

Angelia: William... Havier's intelligence indicates that he is in Bremen, but that still leaves us with a lot of ground to search.

Angelia: This is a very cunning man. Evidence of his activities is detected only after he's long gone, and he always keeps his plans well-concealed.

RPK-16: But you've already got a plan?

Angelia: We don't have nearly enough clues to work with, but it's better than nothing.

Angelia: At least we can now be certain that we're at an important location, and this is where we will find that weasel.

RPK-16: Right... So we've got to drag the weasel out by his tail.

AK-12: That sounds very comedic coming from you.

AN-94: Should we start searching?

Angelia: No need to be hasty. We aren't the only ones who want a piece of the action.

Angelia: Right now, all we need to do is sit tight and wait.

Bremen, Germany.

Angelia's safe house.

Angelia: ...

AK-12: Wanna bet?

RPK-16: 20 minutes.

AN-94: What are you talking about?

AK-15: ...They're guessing how long Ange will stay like this.

AN-94: Huh...

AN-94: I'm surprised you can tell what's going on.

AK-15: This kind of nonsense is not uncommon with RPK.

RPK-16: It's not like we have anything to do.

RPK-16: Miss Ange has been like that for almost two hours.

RPK-16: She looks just like one of those somber Buddha statues in an old temple.

AK-12: It's understandable.

AK-12: We're in quite a bit of a pickle right now, after all.

AN-94: A pickle?

AK-15: ...

RPK-16: Look at you, 15, quietly blending back into the background when the subject grows complex.

RPK-16: You need to be more of a team player, you know.

AK-12: Thanks to our previous good deed of the day, the whole world now has their eyes on Griffin and Ange.

AK-12: Everyone wants to know what happened in "that base" and the truth behind "that tech".

AK-12: People of all kinds, nefarious or otherwise.

AK-12: I'm sure we're being watched very closely.

RPK-16: Even the Stasi, who has so kindly prepared such lovely accommodation for us.

RPK-16: Hell knows what they're really up to.

RPK-16: In any case, this Mr. K does not strike me as a good man.

AK-15: Indeed.

AK-12: So given our circumstances, careful planning is certainly required before we begin our operation.

AK-12: Going in blind without a clue will only land us in an even stickier situation.

RPK-16: Right now, Ange's every move is being watched. If she so much as buys an ice cream, a whole team of intelligence analysts will be there, looking for some kind of hidden significance.

RPK-16: Still, skulking in here and not doing a thing isn't a good idea either.

RPK-16: To our observers, our lack of action can also be perceived as a kind of action.

RPK-16: Who knows? This may actually make them even more uneasy.

AK-12: But let's come back to our task at hand.

AK-12: This is a really tough nut to crack.

AK-12: Going out to buy a bottle of water and running into a dozen agents spying on us.

AK-12: Having only ever watched people myself, I never thought I'd have the pleasure of being on the receiving end of this treatment.

RPK-16: "Abandon all hope,"

RPK-16: "Ye who enter here."

RPK-16: Or so they say.

AK-12: Stop quoting poems out of context.

AK-12: Come to think of it, how goes the "pest extermination"?

RPK-16: I removed twelve from the room and nine outside.

RPK-16: The signal transmission and audio pickup are top of the line—that's German engineering for you.

RPK-16: Maybe I should ask Mr. K to get me some more the next time I see him?

AN-94: It's supposed to be a safe house... I did not expect to find so many bugs.

AK-12: Which just goes to show that even those who look nice and friendly can be up to no good.

AK-12: So have you disabled them all?

RPK-16: I've combed the whole place from floor to ceiling, but who knows?

AK-12: It's not necessarily a bad thing even if you leave a bug or two.

AK-12: If there's anything you want, just inform our eavesdropping friends.

AK-12: They may have it delivered right away.

RPK-16: Hm, you have a point.

RPK-16: Uh, hello? You hear me?

RPK-16: Can I get a ham hock burger?

AK-12: But look at it another way.

AK-12: What we went through in Tallinn and Paldiski is our insurance and hole card.

AK-12: It is the reason why Ange is granted a travel pass that gives her free passage.

Angelia: ...You are exactly right.

RPK-16: Oh, the Buddha is awake.

Angelia: Besides, we've suffered great losses, and M4A1 is still MIA.

Angelia: The Griffin Commander also needs time to recover.

Angelia: We can't expect much help from them right now.

Angelia: Or from the Stasi.

Angelia: There is not a single person we can trust in this city.

AK-12: I admire how effortlessly you just swanned your way into the conversation.

AN-94: Not even Madam Ulrich?

Angelia: She may actually be genuine in her desire to help us.

Angelia: But her position makes it impossible for her act according to her own wishes.

AK-15: ...

Angelia: What is it?

AK-15: ...The satellite phone just buzzed.

RPK-16: Give it to me.

Angelia: What frequency?

RPK-16: 66.45.

AK-12: Is it Havier?

Angelia: That old fox wouldn't risk contacting us unless it's an emergency.

Angelia: What's this about?

RPK-16: Patience. Decrypting this isn't exactly easy.

RPK-16: Hm...

RPK-16: ...

RPK-16: Hoho... Interesting.

Angelia: Stop being cryptic, or I'll let AK-12 handle all communications from now on.

RPK-16: Haha, if she's up to the task, I'm happy to be relieved of this duty.

RPK-16: Now don't be mad; it's good news.

RPK-16: Has anyone heard of the Flora Institute?

AK-12: Sounds like a sweet factory.

Angelia: What's with this institute?

RPK-16: The Commander has discovered some crates that might have originated from Germany.

RPK-16: Havier's people cross-referenced them with reports from other locations, and the contents are very likely to be Epiphylla filled with Collapse Fluid radiation particles.

RPK-16: As contamination sources, these crates have already wiped out several human settlements in the Yellow Zone.

RPK-16: I believe these coordinates that Havier just sent us are where the crates were dispatched from.

Angelia: ...Epiphylla.

Angelia: Looks like our first clue has just presented itself.

AK-12: And I was just saying we didn't have one.

AK-12: Break time's over, 94.

AN-94: Understood.

Knock knock.

RPK-16: Oh, my burger is here.

RPK-16: Well, this trip isn't looking so bad after all.

Angelia: Stop fooling around. Disable the rest of the bugs and call Morridow.

Angelia: Time to start our investigation.
Part 2: Clown

2

Bremen, Germany.

Flora Botanical Research Institute.

Morridow: Guten Morgen, Frau Ange!

Morridow: You look very well-rested.

Angelia: Sorry for the wait.

Morridow: Not at all, don't worry about me. It is my job to serve you.

Morridow: Besides, I am very honored to be given the opportunity to learn from a woman as accomplished as you.

Morridow: Oh, and from you too, Herr Hopps! Thank you for your work.

Hopps: ...Just doing my job.

Angelia: He came to our place first thing in the morning.

Morridow: That's Chairwoman Ulrich's trusted bodyguard for you!

Morridow: Your personal safety is our top priority, Frau Ange.

Morridow: Are you satisfied with your journey to this place?

Angelia: It was alright, though it took Mr. Bodyguard a bit too long to shake off the car that was tailing us.

Angelia: So, this is it?

Morridow: That's right, this is the Flora Botanical Research Institute.

Morridow: It is home to the largest botanical garden in Bremen, with seasonal flowers in bloom all year round.

Morridow: If you're interested, I can give you a tour.

Angelia: ...Is that so?

Angelia: I appreciate the gesture, but maybe next time.

Morridow: Chairwoman Ulrich did say that your wish is my command.

Morridow: But I never thought you'd be interested in botanical research!

Morridow: Your sudden request for a visit really took me by surprise. Still, I do love flowers myself.

Angelia: This is quite massive for a research institute.

Morridow: Ja! The institute's research building is a famous landmark in Bremen.

Morridow: They also have a large field on the other side of the city where they cultivate species for the purpose of research.

Angelia: I see.

Morridow: Come to think of it...

Morridow: How come I don't see the Dolls that accompanied you to Bremen?

Morridow: Is it a good idea for you to travel alone?

Angelia: I'm just here for a visit; they'd just get in the way.

Angelia: Besides, you've given me a personal bodyguard, isn't that right?

Hopps: ...

Morridow: Absolutely!

Morridow: Herr Hopps is such a reassuring presence!

Morridow: It must be the beard!

Angelia: ...The beard?

Morridow: To tell you the truth, this is also the first time I've ever been here.

Morridow: What a beautiful greenhouse they have!

Angelia: Who will we be meeting?

Morridow: Uh, one second please. I believe we have an appointment with...

Morridow: Oh, there she is!

???: ...

Morridow: Allow me to introduce...

Morridow: Frau Leone, Senior Researcher at the Flora Botanical Research Institute.

Morridow: She specializes in research on herbaceous plants.

Leone: ...Hello.

Angelia: Hello, I'm Angelia.

Leone: I know.

Leone: You're investigators sent by the Pan-European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Reconstruction, though I'm not sure what you're doing here.

Angelia: As the one in charge, you're a lot younger than I imagined.

Angelia: Such wonderful accomplishments for your age.

Leone: ...You flatter me.

Leone: I'm just a humble researcher caring for my flowers.

Morridow: We're sorry to bother you on a working day.

Morridow: I hope we're not interrupting anything important?

Leone: Don't worry about it.

Leone: Help yourselves.

Morridow: Huh? You're not going to show us around?

Leone: ...I work in this greenhouse. If you have any questions, just ask.

Leone: I'm sorry, but I'm a researcher, not a tour guide.

Leone: Everyone have things they're good at and things they're...not so good at.

Morridow: ...I understand.

Morridow: In...In that case, sorry to disturb you.

Angelia: We don't seem very welcome here.

Leone: You're mistaken. You are Frau Ulrich's guests.

Leone: The Bremen government has been very supportive of our research.

Leone: It is my duty to fulfil her requests.

Angelia: Then tell me more about yourself.

Angelia: What kind of research do you do here?

Leone: ...We mostly study the propagation and mutation of plants here at the Flora Institute.

Leone: In a world ravaged by mankind...

Leone: Plants are one of the few life forms that can resist radiation and survive.

Leone: We hope to find our "future" by studying them.

Morridow: Find our "future"?

Morridow: That doesn't sound like something a scientist would say. You didn't strike me as a hopeless romantic, Frau Leone.

Leone: Romantic?

Leone: I meant what I said literally; it was not a figure of speech.

Leone: Right now, mankind has no way of moving forward.

Leone: Yet plants have learned to live in harmony with despair long ago.

Leone: If we don't start learning from them, we may very well be sealing our fate.

Angelia: Our future lies in plants?

Angelia: What a peculiar idea.

Leone: Compared to humans, who never learn, plants that keep growing inconspicuously are much more reliable.

Angelia: So what have you learned from these flowers?

Leone: ...A great deal.

Leone: I've spoken more than I should.

Leone: Please take your time and have a look around.

Leone glances at her watch before heading to the other side of the greenhouse to check the thermometer.

Morridow: Seriously? She came out to receive us, but she won't give us a tour?

Morridow: Maybe Herr Hopps looks too intimidating?

Hopps: I disagree.

Morridow: S-Stop glaring at me.

Morridow: I was just kidding.

Angelia: Now that we're inside, the magnitude of their facility is even more apparent.

Angelia: They're investing so much money and resources just to study flowers.

Angelia: Is it worth it?

Morridow: I don't think that's very fair, Frau Ange.

Morridow: Under these times, everything we do must contribute to our survival.

Morridow: But it's not the same for flowers.

Morridow: Their fragrance and colors are only for embellishment; they aren't essential for the flowers' survival.

Morridow: Of course, one must be pragmatic to survive, but virtues are equally—if not more—important.

Morridow: What we can glean from flowers is hope.

Angelia: That's a beautiful speech, but you did not answer my question.

Morridow: J-Just sharing my thoughts!

Morridow: This institute operates on such a large scale because it led the country's research in developing the vaccine and medication for ELID.

Morridow: Their work has saved countless lives!

Morridow: Right, Frau Leone?

Leone: ...

Morridow: ...She's ignoring us altogether.

Angelia: It feels as if she's keeping her distance deliberately, don't you think?

Morridow: Now that you mention it, I'm getting the same feeling.

Morridow: You're right, she does seem to be giving us a wide berth.

Morridow: I knew it—she's unhappy that we're visiting out of the blue!

Angelia: I wish it were that simple.

Morridow: Um, I-I don't think Frau Leone is petty enough to be mad because of your little disagreement.

Angelia: That's not what I meant.

Angelia: It wasn't even a disagreement. I simply asked a couple of questions, but she didn't give any straight answers.

Ange takes in her surroundings.

Angelia: I mean...

Angelia: Other than us, this huge greenhouse is completely empty.

Angelia: Don't you think that's odd?

Morridow: Huh?

Hopps: ...It's too quiet.

Angelia: Ms. Leone, eh?

Leone: ...!

A few steps away, Leone grows tense at Ange's question.

Angelia: Where are the other researchers?

Angelia: Surely you can't be the only one working in such a large institute.

Leone: Since we're having uninvited guests... I've sent everyone else home.

Angelia: Uninvited guests, huh.

Angelia: What a barbed way of putting it.

Angelia: I didn't expect you to put the operation of your facility on hold for an entire day just because I'm here to visit. You're doing me too big a courtesy.

Leone: As I said, you are Chairwoman Ulrich's guests.

Angelia: Not too subtle, are you?

Whoosh.

Ange draws her pistol and aims it straight at Leone.

The latter flinches visibly. Off to the side, Hopps also reaches for his weapon out of reflex.

Morridow: Huh? What? H-Hold on a second? What are you doing?

Morridow: Frau Ange?!

Angelia: Tell me—where is everyone else?

Leone: ...

Leone's lips twitch, but she does not utter a word.

Beep—

The tension in the air is broken by the sudden ring of Ange's communicator.

Angelia: ...What is it? What have you found?

AN-94: Miss Ange, a large number of armed personnel is lying in ambush under the research facility.

AN-94: Please get out immediately. This is a trap.

Angelia: Got it.

Angelia: Wow, serving the main course straight away? Not even bothering with some warm-up?

Morridow: Wait... Huh? Ambush? A trap?

Morridow: What even? J-Just what is going on?!

Hopps has his firearm trained on Leone in the blink of an eye.

Hopps: Arms in the air!

Hopps: Get down on the floor!

Leone: Humph...

With two guns pointed at her, the agitated Leone suddenly lets out a sneer.

Leone: The ending...has been decided since the moment you came in.

Just then, Ange hears a series of soft and rapid clicks coming from above her head.

Then the entire space is filled with pale yellow pollen.

Morridow: What— P-Pollen?

Angelia: !

A pungent scent assaults Ange's nose, giving her no time to react.

The world spins around her and her surroundings distort into something else.

Angelia: ...What?

What is this place...

Angelia: How revolting...

Angelia: Giving me the whole spiel about plants being the hope for humanity then leading me straight into a trap.

In the ruins, a few stumbling ELIDs emerge from around the corner and shuffle towards Ange.

Angelia: I'm hallucinating... I've heard that certain pollens are hallucinogenic.

Angelia: But I didn't expect the effect to be so potent... Maybe it's been processed?

None of this is real. Ange knows that very well.

Angelia: Hallucinations... I know I'm just seeing things, but still.

Still...

She looks at the shambling ELIDs and takes a deep breath.

Angelia: Don't blame me no matter what I hit.

She places her finger on the trigger and takes aim at the "ELIDs".

—!

Just as she is about to pull the trigger...

A strong force dislodges the pistol from her hand.

Soon after that...

Her consciousness dissolves in chaos.
Part 3: Flower View

3

Bremen, Germany.

The Flora Institute's subsidiary flower plantation.

RPK-16: It smells really nice here.

AK-12: Never thought I'd ever have the chance of partnering with you.

RPK-16: Interacting with humans isn't exactly 15 and 94's forte.

RPK-16: Friendly and communicative Dolls like us are more suited to this mission.

AK-12: I'm friendly and communicative enough to handle this alone.

AK-12: You don't even have a pistol with you. What good will you be if things get out of hand?

RPK-16: We aren't authorized to fire on this mission anyway. Since my weapon is such a pain to lug around, I left it with 15.

RPK-16: With a senior veteran as dependable as you, I'm sure it won't be a problem even if I'm unarmed.

AK-12: Since when am I your senior?

AK-12: You didn't leave the factory that much later than me.

RPK-16: You've always been a well-respected team leader. 15 is always talking about you.

RPK-16: Sounds like you had a lot of fun when the three of you were training together. I'm jealous.

AK-12: 15 talking about me? Impossible.

AK-12: Actually, she doesn't talk, period.

AK-12: How do you know about our training days?

RPK-16: How indeed?

RPK-16: Maybe I nagged 15 enough that she spilled. Maybe 15 and I are closer than you think.

RPK-16: Or maybe, 15 didn't actually say anything, and I'm just talking out of my ass.

AK-12: How about you wipe that infuriating smirk off your face?

AK-12: It looks positively repulsive.

RPK-16: Heh... That's really mean. And here I thought I was being nice and approachable.

RPK-16: Do you really hate me so much?

AK-12: I wouldn't go that far.

AK-12: But since you've adopted this persona...

AK-12: Surely you're aware that people won't find it easy to trust you?

RPK-16: What exactly do you mean by that?

RPK-16: I honestly never thought there was anything wrong with my ways.

RPK-16: Would an aphid munching on a flower think they're doing something wrong?

AK-12: Then let me give it to you straight.

AK-12: You reek of danger.

AK-12: There may be some that actually find you friendly and easy-going.

AK-12: But to me, you might as well be a deadly nightshade.

RPK-16: Oh, is it just my imagination?

RPK-16: Or have you also gotten in the habit of using figures of speech?

RPK-16: I love this kind of human rhetoric.

RPK-16: Describing one thing as something that it clearly isn't, in order to lead the mind to compare them.

RPK-16: Almost as if to test my understanding of the world.

AK-12: It was just a momentary urge.

AK-12: Besides, my metaphors are much better than yours.

RPK-16: I see someone, dear senior.

RPK-16: Enough idle chit-chat.

RPK-16: Let's go up and greet them.

Floriculturist: Mm?

Floriculturist: Oh my... What lovely beauties.

RPK-16: Haha, stop pulling our legs.

RPK-16: People may mistake you for a lecherous Italian if you say that to women you've never met.

Floriculturist: Oh, sorry.

Floriculturist: It's just we rarely ever have female visitors here.

Floriculturist: What brings you to the plantation, if I may ask?

AK-12: We're just here on a simple visit.

AK-12: Beautiful flowers go well with beautiful women, don't they?

AK-12: It's all thanks to the hard work of you people.

Floriculturist: I-I see...

Floriculturist: Did she just call herself beautiful...?

RPK-16: Never thought someone would call herself beautiful. I suppose that's just like you.

AK-12: Does anyone disagree with that fact?

Floriculturist: C-Certainly not!

Floriculturist: She called it a fact!

RPK-16: I hear that all the flower plantations in this area operate under the Flora Institute?

RPK-16: How truly impressive. I'm in awe at the sheer scale.

Floriculturist: But of course! Not trying to brag, but you won't find another flower plantation as big as ours in the entire country!

AK-12: Does the Flora Institute really need all these flowers?

Floriculturist: Haha, they certainly can't take them all at once.

Floriculturist: But they do buy up 50 to 60% of everything we grow here.

RPK-16: 50-60%... That's still quite a staggering figure.

RPK-16: What do they need the flowers for?

Floriculturist: That's not something for us to know.

Floriculturist: They could be cooking and eating them for all we care! It's none of our business anyway.

RPK-16: You don't seem at all attached to your hard-earned produce.

AK-12: What about the rest? Do you just throw them away?

Floriculturist: That would be a waste!

Floriculturist: We sell them. People like florists and wedding organizers also need fresh flowers.

Floriculturist: Our plantations do technically belong to the Flora Institute.

Floriculturist: But since we're just one of their subcontractors, as long as we meet their demand, we can handle the remaining crops at our own discretion.

AK-12 & RPK-16: ...

The two Dolls exchange a glance.

AK-12: So basically...

???: Hey.

Floriculturist: Oh... M-Mr. Supervisor!

Supervisor?: Why are you slacking over here, old man...?

Supervisor?: I thought I was the only one who have the right to slack here.

Supervisor?: I'm not to blame if you don't have a decent harvest... Oh? Did you kidnap these pretty ladies to be your flower girls?

RPK-16: He is even more of a talker than you, Lucia.

RPK-16: Mind if I widen his mouth, possibly in pain?

AK-12: Be my guest.

Supervisor: Haha, it is my pleasure to have a beautiful lady caress my lips.

RPK-16: Wow... That's so icky you manage to gross me out. Impressive.

AK-12: So you're their superior?

Supervisor: That's right, I'm their superior.

Supervisor: ...Am I not?

Floriculturist: Uh... Well...

Floriculturist: Of...of course you are!

Floriculturist: You're the supervisor sent by the institute to oversee us.

Supervisor: You hear that?

Supervisor: He says I'm his supervisor.

AK-12: He doesn't seem to be the sharpest tool in the shed.

Supervisor: I've been watching you for a while now.

Supervisor: You've been asking all sorts of questions.

Supervisor: You're not corporate spies, are you?

Floriculturist: Huh? You're spies?!

RPK-16: You've been watching us?

RPK-16: That sounds like something a creep would say.

AK-12: If you weren't up to no good, why didn't you just come and strike up a proper conversation?

RPK-16: The way you were sneaking about, it seems to me you're very anxious to find out what questions we're asking.

RPK-16: Maybe you're the corporate spy?

Supervisor: ...Huh? Me?

Supervisor: Don't be silly, hahahaha...

AK-12: You seem to know a lot of things that we don't.

AK-12: Would you mind having a little chat with us pretty ladies?

RPK-16: We really are curious.

RPK-16: After all, this kind sir here has mentioned something very intriguing.

RPK-16: Surely a gentleman like you won't refuse our invitation?

Floriculturist: I-I really didn't tell them anything!

Floriculturist: Um, I need to get back to work!

Sensing the odd atmosphere, the floriculturist scurries away.

AK-12: You got left behind.

Supervisor: Hey, wait!

Supervisor: Damn heartless guy. I thought we were bros!

RPK-16: Drop the act, Mr. Supervisor.

RPK-16: You don't actually know the floriculturists here all that well, do you?

RPK-16: From the awkwardness between you, it's obvious that you barely know your "bro".

Supervisor: ...Uh.

AK-12: Well, Mr. Supervisor?

AK-12: Mind telling us what you know?

Supervisor: Oh boy... Can't be helped then.

Supervisor: In that case, please follow me.

Supervisor: Here we are... Please head inside.

AK-12: ...Hm?

RPK-16: Oops.

Once the two Dolls have entered the building, the door slams shut behind them.

Supervisor: I did try to warn you.

Supervisor: This isn't somewhere two pretty ladies should be wandering around.

AK-12: Crap. We've been had.

RPK-16: Dear me, it turned out to be a trap.

In the face of a room filled with fully-armed soldiers, the two Dolls grin in unison.
Part 4: Gathering Frost Wolves

4

Bremen, Germany.

Flora Botanical Research Institute.

At the back entrance.

AK-15: I've masked us from the surveillance system.

AN-94: What's the security status?

AK-15: All clear.

AN-94: Understood.

AN-94: Restate our objective.

AK-15: Ange will distract the staff out front.

AK-15: Meanwhile, we will infiltrate the facility and search for clues and evidence of any floral experiments.

AK-15: We are also to investigate William's connection with this institute.

AN-94: ...I will be in charge of the mission. Is that okay with you?

AK-15: I have no objections.

AN-94: Actually...

AN-94: If you have a problem with that, we can switch roles.

AK-15: Only one brain is necessary for the mission.

AK-15: It has already been decided that you will take charge.

AK-15: I do not question that decision.

AN-94: I don't understand why Ange has put me in charge...

AN-94: You have more field experience than me.

AK-15: Experience and leadership are different.

AK-15: You are more skilled in command.

AK-15: Past training records have concluded that I am not effective in making tactical decisions. Deferring to your judgment is more efficient.

AN-94: You've changed a lot.

AK-15: I have not changed. I still dislike convoluted strategies.

AK-15: You and RPK are both capable of completing objectives in an efficient manner, which I approve.

AK-15: But 12 is different. As long as AK-12 is not in command, I have no complaints.

AN-94: 12 always has her reasons.

AK-15: Which she never bothers to tell us.

AK-15: My dissatisfaction with her stems from her tendency of getting sidetracked by other irrelevant objectives and making our mission unnecessarily challenging.

AN-94: But those objectives often end up helping a lot of people.

AK-15: Her gratuitous compassion could result in the failure of our missions.

AK-15: She may have weighed the odds, but she never justifies her reasons to me.

AK-15: Unlike you, I cannot give her my unconditional trust.

AN-94: Ahem. Will you be alright with just a pistol?

AK-15: No problem. Light firearms are better suited for infiltrations.

AK-15: Besides, my own rifle is right here in the case.

AN-94: Right. I will provide fire support when needed.

AK-15: Please.

AN-94: Ange is entering the greenhouse.

AK-15: What are our engagement protocols?

AN-94: Secrecy is paramount. No explosives at any cost.

AN-94: Also try to avoid opening fire if at all possible.

AK-15: Roger that.

AK-15 tugs at her tactical gloves and presses herself against the wall.

The two Dolls are breaking into the building through an emergency exit.

There are four such exits altogether at the Flora laboratories.

AN-94 has chosen this particular one because she believes it is the safest option.

AK-15: There's a safety lock.

AN-94: Can you break it?

AK-15: Yes.

AK-15 wraps her hand around the lock and tears it right off.

Clang!

The sound of metal rupturing is short and sharp.

AN-94: Go.

AN-94: Hush.

On their way in, AN-94 gestures for AK-15 to stop.

AK-15: ...What is it?

AN-94: According to Ange's topographic map, we'll soon be entering the restricted area.

AN-94: There will be researchers and security staff.

AN-94: Scan for life forms.

AK-15: I have, but I'm not detecting anyone.

AN-94: The scanner isn't picking up anyone?

AN-94: But the map shows that the working area is right there.

AK-15: I'm not seeing any life signs at all, not even plants.

AN-94: Let's get inside and have a look.

AN-94: Can you see any entrances?

AN-94: Try not to let any security cameras capture you.

AK-15: Hold on.

AN-94: What's wrong?

AK-15: This wall is way too thin.

AK-15 walks over to the corner.

Her eyes glow red as she scans the space. Then she activates a mechanism hidden at a desk.

Clatter...

AN-94: ...A hidden door?

AK-15: Should we go in?

AN-94: Yes.

AN-94: Stay vigilant and watch your surroundings.

AK-15: Understood.

AN-94: There is such a large subterranean structure.

AN-94: I didn't notice it at all.

AK-15: You would've spotted it if you had my eyes.

AK-15: Even without them, it would only be a matter of time for you to discover this place with your experience.

AN-94: ...Am I imagining things?

AN-94: You seem a bit too eager with your encouragement.

AK-15: I never encourage others. Encouragement itself is pointless.

AK-15: I am merely stating facts. You are an excellent operative, AN-94.

AK-15: And we will accomplish our mission. That's all there is to it.

AN-94: ...You're too kind, but you really don't have to baby me.

AN-94: I'm not the way I used to be.

AN-94: Wait... Look, over there.

Perhaps in an attempt to change the subject, AN-94 suddenly directs her attention to what lies ahead.

In the center of the room is a large amount of something very familiar to them.

AK-15: ...Epiphylla.

AN-94: In vast quantities.

AN-94: Where's the radiation detector?

AK-15: Scanning for radioactivity.

AK-15: These flowers contain a high concentration of radioactive particles.

AN-94: So Ange was right...

AK-15: And the containers.

AK-15: Looks like these flowers are about to be packed and transported.

AN-94: The flowers the Commander has discovered must have originated from here.

AK-15: What do we do?

AN-94: Don't alert them just yet.

AN-94: Let me report this to Ange.

AK-15: Right.

AK-15 takes several steps forward, ready to investigate further.

AN-94: Stop.

AK-15: What is it?

AN-94: Hush.

AN-94 gestures for her to keep quiet. Then she creeps carefully up to the corner and stoops.

AN-94: Someone's there.

AK-15: ...

AK-15 clams up and makes her way rapidly to another spot for better observation.

AK-15: There are a lot of them, and they're all armed.

AK-15: But they show no signs of having noticed us.

AN-94: They probably did not expect anyone to venture so deep into the facility.

AN-94: Stay hidden...and avoid a direct confrontation for now.

AK-15: I believe that would be difficult.

AN-94: Hm?

AK-15: Even for a restricted facility, they are a bit too well-armed.

AK-15: They look more like a quick reaction force lying in ambush than regular security staff to me.

AN-94: Ambush?

The realization strikes AN-94 immediately.

AN-94: I see...

AN-94: They're here for Ange.

AK-15: Looks like Ange was correct.

AK-15: However, her visit was arranged at very short notice.

AK-15: If Ange really is the target of this ambush, then they've been extremely quick.

AN-94: This is the only possible explanation at the moment.

AN-94: Even if I'm wrong, we must still inform Ange ASAP.

AK-15: Understood. I'll cover you.

AK-15 crouches down and takes her assault rifle out of the case.

Click.

At the same time, AN-94 gets in touch with Ange.

Angelia: ...What is it? What have you found?

AN-94: Miss Ange, a large number of armed personnel is lying in ambush under the research facility.

AN-94: Please get out immediately. This is a trap.

Angelia: ...Got it.

Click.

Ange hangs up.

AK-15: 94.

AN-94: Hm?

AK-15: They're on the move.

AN-94: ...Ange won't make it in time.

AK-15: What should we do?

AK-15: The human bodyguard can't handle this many enemies.

AK-15: We have to go to Ange's rescue.

Bang bang!

A series of gunshots erupt to the side almost instantaneously.

AN-94: There are even more of them!

Bang!

Several bullets come whizzing towards their cover from the other end of the room.

From their assaulters' angry shouts, it is obvious that they have spotted the two uninvited guests.

AK-15: What now?

AK-15: Do we return fire or retreat?

AK-15: Decide.

AN-94 does not have to make decisions very often. She has never been particularly good at it.

What would AK-12 do in this situation? What does AK-15 want her decision to be?

AN-94: What do you suggest?

AK-15: You're the one in charge.

AK-15: I defer to your judgment.

AN-94: Alright... New objective.

Clack.

AN-94 pauses briefly and pulls the bolt on her rifle.

AN-94: Exterminate all enemy units.

AN-94: Then we rescue Ange.

AK-15: Roger that.
Part 5: Light Show

5

Bremen, Germany.

City Hall.

Knock knock.

Ulrich: Come in.

K: ...

Ulrich: Welcome... Do I still need to call you K?

Ulrich: Or should it be Herr Schwaben?

K: Call me whatever you want.

K: Why have you sent for me?

Ulrich: Asking questions like that only serves to lower my opinion of you, Kain.

Ulrich: Of course, if you truly do not know, then please close the door.

K: You're as sharp as ever, even though I've only just returned.

Ulrich: I'm very glad to see that you've made it back alive.

Ulrich: However, the wheels keep turning, and there's no time for us to catch our breath.

Ulrich: I've wasted enough time on mere pleasantries.

K: Your job is to be the kindly face.

K: But was everything you told Ange also mere pleasantries?

Ulrich: ...Not all of it.

Ulrich: Those Soviets saved my life, and my gratitude to her and her friends is sincere. I also believe that we wish for the same thing.

Ulrich: However, the fact that we're on different sides means that on the surface, at least, we cannot be truly frank and earnest with each other.

K: I'm sure she feels the same way.

K: However, there's a reason the Prometheans sent her over.

K: There'll definitely be a chance for us to work with Ange.

K: We've all seen her abilities, and she wants to solve the same problems that we do.

K: Also, she brought those two very useful Dolls with her.

K: Perhaps I'll be able to collect more data on them. After all, that fox was clearly hiding things from us last time.

Ulrich: But considering the problems she's facing, even the protection of the Wolf Pack is only delaying the inevitable.

Ulrich: The information Angelia possesses is enough to draw the world's attention.

Ulrich: It's not only us. "They" are also watching, ready to strike.

K: So the centipede keeps writhing, even when it's dead...

K: I guess this is their last stand.

Ulrich: Pathetic wretches.

Ulrich: They actually believe that they can use "Relics" to turn the tide.

Ulrich: Are the examples set by those politicians being arrested in Moscow not able to sway those numbskulls?

K: Idiots are often overly confident in themselves.

K: I will not let them touch Ange.

Ulrich: Very good. That is also your responsibility.

Ulrich: But don't underestimate the opposition. They still have enough backing to put up a fight right now.

Ulrich: You can glimpse their hand at work in the refugee situation.

Ulrich: ...What foolish chauvinists.

K: My people have been following the matter for a long time.

K: We'll get to the bottom of this.

Ulrich: It's not enough to get to the bottom of it, K.

Ulrich: We need to rip them up by the roots... But that is another matter.

Ulrich: I asked for you today because of...

K: The information Ange possesses?

Ulrich: Nobody knows what she found in William's lab besides her.

Ulrich: Not even you—who was present at the time—had the chance to come into contact with it.

Ulrich: The Prometheans aren't going to just hand over something that important.

Ulrich: Also, it's more reassuring to have certain things in your own hands.

K: I understand... Though there's one thing that intrigues me.

K: Ange and that Griffin Commander are on the same side. A civilian company is easier to handle than the Prometheans.

K: Have you considered taking advantage of that?

Ulrich: I can't, Kain.

Ulrich: That much is obvious.

Ulrich: I'm not an ungrateful person.

Ulrich: If I used Griffin as a bargaining chip, then I would definitely lose Ange's trust.

Ulrich: Personally, I quite like Angelia. Both she and the Commander are brave and upright people, and I am glad to call them my friends.

Ulrich: However, we can't always be on the same side due to national interests.

Ulrich: Right now, her trump card is that information from William's lab, which she won't divulge so easily for obvious reasons.

Ulrich: Fortunately, we've booked ourselves the best seats in the house.

Ulrich: Protect her, gain her trust, and the rest will surely follow.

K: Of course, I understand. However...

K: I believe that's not all you want to say?

K: If that was it, there'd be no need for you to summon me here.

Ulrich: ...

Ulrich: ...Yes. Frankly speaking, you are one of the few people in Bremen I can trust.

Ulrich: There are some personal things which I can only share with you.

K: To be honest, having that much trust placed in me is a little unsettling.

Ulrich: As the "Chairwoman", every word I just said was sincere.

Ulrich: We need Relic technology. Even if we don't use it ourselves, we need to have it in our hands for the sake of the Volk.

Ulrich: But as "Ulrich"...

Ulrich: Even if Angelia makes up her mind and refuses to leak any information...

Ulrich: I still do not want to see her harmed or threatened.

Ulrich: There are some matters over which I do not have full control.

Ulrich: There is still a lot of noise within the government, and it will take time for Rossartrism to be accepted.

Ulrich: Do you understand what I'm getting at, K?

K: So there are still many ruthless people out there...

Ulrich: And some of them are my superiors.

K: Well, this is quite the personal request. Still, you could have made it part of official business.

K: Regardless, I know how to proceed with the mission.

K: It's just...

Ulrich: Yes...?

K: It's just a bit surprising that you're being so honest, given that you're a politician.

K: Leaving me aside, if you told anyone else about this and they had it on tape...

K: Well, I imagine that would be the end of your career.

Ulrich: I know the risks I'm taking.

Ulrich: But I feel that I need to tell you what I really think.

K: Why is that? Why do you care so much about her?

Ulrich: Our ultimate goal is to become the shining beacon in a brave new world, K.

Ulrich: I often think back to those days in Belgrade.

Ulrich: This world needs people like Angelia. She doesn't just represent herself, but those who are like her as well.

Ulrich: She might be a Soviet, but the world has the impetus to forge ahead because of people like her as well as the Commander who saved me.

Ulrich: Only humans can improve humanity.

Ulrich: If you ask me, that spirit is far more valuable than Relic Technology.

K: I understand.

Ulrich: Thank you.

K: You're welcome. Frankly speaking, that is my intention as well.

K: But there's one more thing I'd like to ask you about.

Ulrich: "Paradeus"?

K: Yes... In other words, the reason why Ange has paid us this visit.

Ulrich: We know very little about them.

Ulrich: And I can't spare the manpower to dig into it. All we can do is take the minimum necessary measures to protect ourselves against them.

K: Our agency believes they have already infiltrated our government.

Ulrich: If that's true, it would explain the foolish actions taken by "them".

Ulrich: After all, it would be very hard for someone who was not a spy to do such things.

Ulrich: Ange will take care of them for us. All you need to do is work with her.

K: Very well. I'll take care of it.

Ulrich: Who's in charge of the operation?

K: It's "J".

Ulrich: ...

K: ...Don't look at me like that.

K: He's the best man for the job.

Ulrich: ...Let's leave that aside for now.

Ulrich: You may go.

Ulrich: Remember, don't give your trust easily.

Ulrich: Even the people close to you might be spies for "them".

K: And what about the people you assigned to Ange?

Ulrich: They...

Click—

K: Ah... Sorry.

Ulrich: It's alright, go ahead and take it.

K: Of course.

K: ...

K: ...What?

K: ...

K: Wait a minute, don't hang up, explain—!

Click.

Ulrich: Was it J?

K: ...Excuse me, ma'am. I have to leave now.

K: Angelia's been attacked.

Ulrich: ...

Ulrich: Go.

Ulrich: And make sure she's safe!

K: Understood!
Part 6: Hay Fever- End

    6chevron_right

Buzz...

The ringing in Ange's ears grows louder as she slowly regains consciousness. Then an intense pain akin to being stabbed by a thousand needles jolts her wide awake.

The sound of gunfire feels very distant. For a brief second, she thinks she is still hallucinating.

Angelia: ...Urk.

AK-12: Don't throw up on me, Ange.

AK-12: I like my outfit.

Angelia: A...AK-12?

Angelia: Where am I...?

Supervisor: Oh, stay still, Miss Ange. The stuff is still in your system.

Supervisor: You're very weak right now.

Angelia: ...!

The face of a stranger suddenly enters Ange's field of vision. She reaches for her weapon out of reflex but finds her holster empty.

Supervisor: Whoa, hold your horses!

Supervisor: Chill, I'm one of the good guys!

Angelia: ...Seeing as AK-12 has refrained from breaking your neck, I'll give you a chance to introduce yourself.

She feels a warm wetness coming down her nose. She wipes it away roughly and several drops of blood splatter on the ground.

Fighting to keep the dizziness at bay, she clenches her jaw and manages to squeeze that remark through her teeth.

Supervisor: You remember K?

Supervisor: I'm his colleague. You can call me J.

Supervisor: But don't worry, I'm not like him. As for what sets me apart...

Supervisor: Well, I can give you many examples, but I suppose the most obvious difference is in the face.

Angelia: The face?

J: Uh, what I mean is...

J: I'm obviously the more handsome one.

Angelia: ...

Ange's face remains completely deadpan.

J smiles sheepishly and passes her a handkerchief.

Ange ignores it and takes out a tissue from her pouch.

Angelia: ...The Stasi?

She tries to shake off the wooziness. That's when she realizes that besides AK-12, she's also surrounded by multiple armed guards.

AK-12: You were right on, Ange.

AK-12: These Stasi blokes have been investigating this place for a while. K has already arranged for them to assist us.

AK-12: You were incredibly lucky. When we arrived, you were just about to blow Miss Secretary's head open.

Morridow: M-My head?

Morridow: Really?!

Morridow starts frantically patting her own head in retrospective fear.

J: Did you just call me a "bloke"?

J: That didn't sound too nice.

J: I had only seen you in photos, but I feel like we've known each other for a lifetime!

Hopps: ...Gah.

Next to Ange, Morridow and Hopps aren't faring too well either. They seem to have woken up not long ago.

Morridow seems to be in especially rough shape. Compared to the strong and burly Hopps, her immune system is clearly much less robust—her face is white as a sheet.

Hopps, on the other hand, looks absolutely livid as he covers his nose with a hand.

J: Having a nosebleed?

Hopps: ...So what?

J: That checks out.

J: Do you have any idea what it was that you inhaled?

J: That yellow powder... Hm... I estimate that you three have less than two hours to live.

Hopps: What?!

J: Hahahaha, your faces were hilarious!

J: Relax. I was just kidding. You'll be fine after some rest.

Hopps: ...You call yourself an agent of the Stasi?

Hopps: What a joke.

Morridow: Y...You scared the living daylights out of me... I was about to start writing my last will!

Angelia: Looks like you've got the situation under control. Where's Leone?

AK-12: We didn't see anyone else other than the three of you.

AK-12: Also, you're not out of danger yet. The enemy forces that AN-94 reported are surrounding this place.

AK-12: Since you're in no state to move, evacuation is impossible.

Angelia: Help me up...

Angelia: What kind of enemy forces are we talking about?

AK-12: Just a ragtag group of thugs—nothing to worry about.

AK-12: They barely know how to use their weapons.

AK-12: We killed a few of them. Now they're all hovering outside, too afraid to come in.

J: They've probably realized that their plan was falling apart.

J: Yet they still refuse to give up. Other than Dolls, only those zealots would be so tenacious.

Angelia: ...Zealots?

J: Yep, as in fanatics.

J: The Flora Institute actually masks a cult where members have a maniacal obsession with plants and worship them.

J: They even believe that plants are more advanced life forms, whereas humans are mere fertilizers. Scary, isn't it?

Angelia: ...Paradeus?

J: So you've heard of Paradeus...

J: But no, unlike Paradeus, this is just a regular cult.

Angelia: They can't be just a "regular" cult. They've got to be related to Paradeus.

J: You think so?

J: But even if you're right, that's none of my business. Paradeus isn't my case.

J: Sheesh, you made me break cover and just like that, my mission is now in shambles.

J: I haven't even finished compiling the chain of evidence.

J: But seeing that Miss White Wolf here is such a stunning beauty, I'll let it slide.

AK-12: Can I break his fingers, Ange?

Boom!

Morridow: Eeeeeep!

Morridow: W-What's going on?

J: For someone in a weakened state, you're very loud...

AK-12: I told you, they're hardly any trouble.

AK-12: We'll just have to wait it out.

A commotion erupts outside the door and subsides just as abruptly.

Then...the door is slowly pushed open.

Stasi Agent: !

The Stasi agents raise their weapons simultaneously, but they are quite taken aback by the ones coming in.

AK-15: ...

AN-94: Sorry we're late.

AK-12: Not at all, 94. Your friend hasn't been slowing you down, has she?

AK-12: You're right on time.

Morridow: Uh... Ah!

Morridow: S-So you must be the other DEFY members...!

Morridow: You're just like the Valkyries!

Angelia: ...Well done, but it's not over yet.

Angelia: They're too well-armed for a mere cult.

Angelia: They've got to be storing more information and clues somewhere. Our job here isn't over until we find them.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: ...Where's RPK-16?

AK-12: Humph... That fox has a good nose on her.

Leone: No, this isn't right... Dammit! Where did it go wrong?!

In the underground research area, Leone is huddling inside her own office.

The plan was supposed to be perfect! We...We managed to obtain so many weapons! How did we get defeated?!

Leone: Why is the Stasi here?

Leone: Even our backup forces got wiped out... You can't be serious! Nobody told me we'd be going up against a bunch of monstrous Dolls!

Those silvery white figures haunt Leone's mind like nightmarish phantoms.

Normal humans are no match for the Tactical Dolls that Angelia has by her side.

Even though they were vastly outnumbered, those ruffians given weapons with no training must have been like mere children to them.

???: Monsters. Oh god, they're monsters.

???: They wear human faces, but the things they do are beyond human comprehension.

???: That's what you'd call monsters.

Leone: Who... Urk!

Leone does not notice the approaching figure until she hears an amused chuckle. Unnerved, she draws a pistol from her waist by reflex.

But in just an instant, her wrist is clenched by a hand strong as a vise, and what follows is excruciating pain.

Leone: Argh... Aaaaaaaaaargh!

Leone: M-My arm!

The pain causes Leone to loosen her grip and the pistol clatters on the floor.

That's when Leone gets a clear look at her assailant—billowy hair as pale as the Devil's bones.

RPK-16: Watch your feet.

The grinning Doll swipes with her left leg, knocking Leone heavily onto the ground.

Leone's broken right wrist still in her deadly clasp, the Doll pins the woman down with her knee.

RPK-16: I do apologize.

RPK-16: I'm not armed, so I'm afraid I have to be rough.

Leone: You...ugh...argh!

The severe pain has jolted Leone's mind into sharp focus.

Drops of sweat glisten on her forehead. She finds it hard to believe that the Doll has snuck up to her without her noticing.

RPK-16: Now, could you please tell me...

RPK-16: Where do you store your research material?

Leone: You...wish... I will never hand it over to you basta...

Snap.

Leone: Aaaaaargh!

RPK-16 breaks Leone's right index finger.

RPK-16: That's not what I want to hear, you know?

The girl wears a slight smile, but her grip on the latter's broken wrist is as tight as ever.

She coos amorously into Leone's ear like a lover.

Leone: (Coughs) You...

Leone: You damn mechanical...bitch...

RPK-16: Still strong enough to hurl insults, eh? You've got some spine for a simple office worker, I'll give you that.

Leone: I will not...submit...to low-life like you...!

RPK-16: You're absolutely right. I do seem to be wasting my breath.

Snap.

Leone: Gaaah!

Leone: No... Stop! Stop it, you Devil!

Leone pants frantically.

Despite having another of her fingers broken, her reaction is a lot less intense than before, as if she is getting acclimated to the pain.

RPK-16: I knew it—even you are afraid of death.

RPK-16: Though being turned into compost is perfectly in line with your ideology.

RPK-16: Isn't human life supposed to be totally worthless?

RPK-16: So why are you clinging onto it so desperately?

Leone: You...heartless monster!

Leone: What do you know?!

RPK-16: Yes, I'm a werewolf; I'm a Yeti; I'm Frankenstein's monster.

RPK-16: But what about you?

RPK-16: You're just a pathetic human.

Leone: Pathetic? What...gives you the right to humiliate me?

Leone: You think you can ridicule my belief just because you have me at your mercy?

Leone: You, a mere machine?!

RPK-16: Can't I?

RPK-16: You think of yourself as a martyr, yet you're no less a coward than anyone else in face of death.

RPK-16: You might try to justify your cowardice by claiming that you wish to do more to further your cause.

RPK-16: However, you have done nothing but dance on a string to someone else's tune this whole time.

RPK-16: To a spectator like me...

RPK-16: You're not even dancing the Kazachok; you're just clowning around.

Leone: Y-You're calling me a clown?

Leone: I-I will not abide by your insults...!

Leone: I will not let you...!

RPK-16: How pitiful... Other than such undignified howls, don't you have anything more effective to say in your defense?

RPK-16: I just don't understand. Is it really so hard for humans to admit their own mistakes?

RPK-16: A human who believes it's wrong for humankind to exist—what a bizarre paradox.

Leone: (Gasps)

Leone clenches her teeth. She is on the verge of passing out because of the pain.

Even she doesn't know how she can still muster the strength to make rebukes in her current state.

As she struggles to keep the pain at bay, the T-Doll's sinister voice once again comes whispering into her ear.

RPK-16: Has it really never occurred to you...

RPK-16: Just how laughable your actions have been?

Leone: ...What do you mean?

RPK-16: Your plan is way too shabby.

RPK-16: You may think that you still stand a good chance simply because you're now in possession of a force that's beyond your wildest imagination.

RPK-16: Those thugs were probably your wretched followers, but you certainly didn't conjure all those weapons out of thin air.

Leone: ...

Leone's breath grows steadier.

RPK-16 can tell that she is slowly coming to her senses, that her words are starting to sink in.

She continues to murmur into the human's ear.

RPK-16: Someone must have given you those weapons, am I right? It is pretty obvious that you and your friends aren't particularly good with guns.

RPK-16: Not to mention, I simply can't think of any good reason for you to kill Ange.

RPK-16: Which means...it wasn't your idea. You're acting on orders.

Leone: I'm being used. Is that what you're trying to say?

Leone's voice grows cold.

RPK-16: You don't sound surprised at all.

RPK-16: I suppose you expected as much.

Leone: I've known that all along.

Leone: I need resources for my research; they need my research.

Leone: We've both been using each other for our own ends from the very beginning. It's a mutually-beneficial relationship. Do you think I'd feel sorry for myself because of that?

She sneers triumphantly, believing that she has outsmarted RPK-16.

RPK-16: You have a point. You ARE an intelligent scientist.

RPK-16: You may not be a woman of the world, but you are not that gullible.

RPK-16: I suppose you have absolutely no problem with being sacrificed like a pawn?

Leone: ...Sacrificed?

RPK-16: A relationship is only "mutually-beneficial" when both parties acknowledge each other's value.

RPK-16: Unfortunately, you have chosen a terrible partner to begin with. You ask a tiger for its hide, and you end up getting toyed with like a rat.

RPK-16: Your role in this operation is a pawn to be sacrificed, nothing more. Do you still believe you're in control?

Leone: What is that supposed to mean?

RPK-16: Exactly that.

RPK-16: The one who gave you this task knew all along that you wouldn't succeed.

RPK-16: He pushed you into the fire and is clapping at the show on his own spectator's stand.

Leone: ...You're a lousy interrogator.

Leone: You think I'd buy your terrible lies?

RPK-16: Now I feel sorry for you. I'm surprised you still have any faith in them.

RPK-16: Do you honestly believe that the reason your plan is in shambles, that is, our involvement in this matter, is pure coincidence?

Leone: What are you getting at?

RPK-16: Ange's visit was a spontaneous decision, yet you were thoroughly prepared.

RPK-16: They're so well-informed, I'm starting to wonder if they've planted a mole...

RPK-16: But if Ange can't take a crap without them noticing, isn't it odd that they didn't take her T-Dolls' strength into consideration?

Leone: ...You Dolls look no different than humans.

RPK-16: You say that, but you're also starting to have your doubts, aren't you?

RPK-16: Hm, that's a good sign.

RPK-16: Now let me ask you another question. If you had really wanted to kill Ange...

RPK-16: Why would your partner give you nothing but weapons?

RPK-16: You might have been unaware of our strength, but surely your partner should've told you?

RPK-16: He knew none of your followers were trained professionals, yet he didn't lend you a single soldier. Stingy, isn't he?

Leone: ...

RPK-16 lets go of Leone's hand.

RPK-16: Do you understand now?

RPK-16: That's because weapons are cheap, while trained soldiers are very expensive.

RPK-16: Leaving that aside, you don't even seem to have what remotely looks like a backup plan.

RPK-16: Let me guess. Your partner didn't arrange for your escape, did he?

Leone: The weapons, the accurate information...

Leone: These were all nothing but a smokescreen?

RPK-16: As I said, a sacrificed pawn is all you are. That's the unmistakable truth.

RPK-16: He was just testing the waters to gauge our strength with your little stunt.

RPK-16: I'm sure he's very happy with the results.

RPK-16: He's probably also having a good laugh over how stupid you and your friends are.

RPK-16: Even so, do you still insist that what you did wasn't entirely pointless?

Leone: ...

Leone: ...I was tricked?

RPK-16: Would you like me to give you an answer?

Leone: I've always known this is how it would end...

Leone: I just didn't expect it to happen so soon.

RPK-16: You have my respect.

RPK-16: Only a moth would know how mesmerizing the flame is.

Leone: ...

Leone: ...You'll find what you want on the server. The physical key is behind the second drawer of the desk.

Leone: Look for it yourself.

RPK-16: Thank you.

RPK-16 slowly releases Leone and backs off a few paces to give her some room to collect herself.

Without even a glance at the scrambling human, she turns away and strolls towards the computer with one hand on the back of her neck.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Consecutive shots are fired and sparks fly off RPK-16's slender back.

When she turns around, she sees Leone pointing the revolver that was lying on the floor straight at her.

RPK-16: ...Why would you fire at a T-Doll in a bulletproof vest with a gun of that kind of caliber?

RPK-16: You know it wouldn't leave a scratch on me.

Bang!

RPK-16 tilts her head as a bullet brushes past her cheek, a glint of bright silver displacing the tip of her hair.

Leone: Why didn't you kill me?

RPK-16: My objective is to obtain those data.

RPK-16: You're the one who knows where they're stored.

Leone: But I've already given you the location.

RPK-16: I haven't confirmed it... Do you want me to kill you?

Leone: Compared to being humiliated by those sickening idealists, I much prefer this ending.

RPK-16: But I have no desire of putting you out of your misery.

RPK-16: Or should I say, there's no point in doing that.

Leone: ...I've answered your questions and given you what you want. Now it's your turn to answer mine.

Leone: If you'd been abandoned by the world and things were utterly hopeless, would you choose to die?

RPK-16: ...

RPK-16: Death is humans' prerogative. It's something I'm extremely envious of.

Leone: Humph... So THIS is our so-called "future"?

Leone: Haha, what a joke...

Leone pauses before letting out a sardonic chuckle.

Leone: If you are the "future", then I'd rather...

She slowly turns the muzzle of the gun towards herself and presses it against her left temple.

RPK-16 watches without batting an eyelash.

Click!

...Leone pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty.

RPK-16 wipes her cheek with a thumb.

RPK-16: I counted correctly. That was the last round.

Leone: ...Even fate has betrayed me at this point.

RPK-16: It wasn't fate that betrayed you; it was yourself.

RPK-16: YOU made all the choices, and it was YOU who fired all the shots.

RPK-16 ignores Leone, who is in utter despair, and turns to the computer.

She unwraps the bandages around her neck to reveal a hidden "collar" before placing her case onto the desk.

She plugs herself in and turns on the computer.

RPK-16: ...Oh my.

However...

RPK-16: We've been...bamboozled.

There is nothing on the hard disk.

The research data, the communication logs with "a certain organization", and whatever else that RPK-16 expected to find, all of it is gone.

RPK-16 looks at Leone.

RPK-16: If only it were your doing.

RPK-16: At least you would have achieved something with your pitiful life.

RPK-16: Still, judging by the handiwork... They must've cleaned up long ago.

RPK-16: Right, I see.

She smiles mockingly.

RPK-16: In the end, he played us all like fiddles.

(Footsteps)

Angelia: ...There you are.

RPK-16: Oh, you found me.

Angelia: Give me a heads-up next time you wander off.

Angelia: What's the situation?

RPK-16: All information and research data have been wiped clean.

RPK-16: It doesn't seem to be Miss Leone's doing.

RPK-16: Our enemy is one step ahead of us.

Angelia: I know.

Angelia: This visit is just my way of saying hello.

Angelia: ...Hm?

Angelia: What's the matter with her?

RPK-16: Who knows? Probably lost all hope.

Angelia: Did you do this to her?

RPK-16: At least she's still alive. That's better than being dead, right?

Angelia: ...Humph.

Angelia: If she knows she's gonna spend the rest of her life in prison, she'll probably want to die.

RPK-16: Humans really do understand each other. She tried.

Angelia: You're a sick bastard.

Angelia: Hand her over to the Stasi for interrogation.

RPK-16: Come to think of it, I'm a bit curious.

RPK-16: Do you believe the world's future lies in plants?

Angelia: Of course not. What a load of crap.

Angelia: If plants could solve all the problems, why would they need us to do all the dirty work?

Angelia: What, did she convert you?

RPK-16: I don't know. What do you want me to say?

RPK-16: We Dolls are not unlike plants. Some humans consider us the future. They give us a purpose and hope we can point them towards "the correct path".

RPK-16: But who is to tell us what is correct?

RPK-16: If plants aren't the answer, are we?

Angelia: Did Leone brainwash you or something?

RPK-16: No, observing her behavior just gave me some food for thought.

Angelia: ...Alright, enough of your philosophical epiphany.

Angelia: Bring her back with us, this isn't over yet.

RPK-16: Your wish is my command, my lady.

On a stormy night, someone is rummaging frantically through the room.

???: Dammit, why now?!

A flash of lightning snakes across the night sky, lighting up the interior of the room and revealing a lifeless face reflected on the window.

In the brief second of illumination, something seems to have caught the man's eyes. He steps over messy stacks of documents to reach it.

???: I can't believe you'd betray us, but I won't let you get away with it!

It thunders just as the clock on the wall strikes the hour and starts chiming.

...

Screeeeech!

The car screeches to a sudden halt, interrupting Ange's thoughts.

Chauffeur: Dammit! A stray dog darted across the road out of nowhere.

Morridow: Pfft, good thing it was just a dog.

Angelia: Hm?

Morridow turns to address Ange.

Morridow: Don't be alarmed. Some homeless guy dashed onto the road and robbed a car in this area not long ago, that's why Herr Chauffeur is so on edge.

Angelia: Homeless guy...?

Morridow: A number of refugees refused to enter the allocated refugee settlement and have been hanging around sparsely populated rural areas instead.

Morridow: There have already been quite a few burglaries and even murders. These people have no respect for the local law whatsoever.

Morridow: Ever since the incidents with the homeless refugees ganging up to rob passing cars, everyone has to be extra careful when driving out of the city.

Angelia: The orphanage is at such a remote location. Isn't that dangerous?

Morridow: We have security measures in place at the orphanage. The security staff is authorized to carry firearms.

Morridow: But it's true that things haven't been too peaceful around here. Apparently, there's been a few thefts.

Angelia: I have a bad feeling about this. How long will it take us to get there?

Morridow: We're still about a 30-minute drive away from Berle Orphanage.

Angelia: We'll be an hour late by the time we arrive.

Angelia: It's rude enough that we're visiting at 8pm.

Morridow: Can't be helped... It's raining like crazy...

Morridow: Who knew there would be a traffic accident and we would be stuck in a jam for so long?

Morridow: Besides, you only asked me to organize this meeting in the afternoon.

Angelia: That's because I only found out about certain matters this afternoon.

Morridow: Oh dear...

Morridow: Well, things being the way they are, if you think it's too late, I can call and postpone the meeting.

Angelia: No, we can't afford to waste any more time.

Angelia: It's been a whole week since we've captured Leone at the Flora Institute, but she hasn't really divulged anything.

Angelia: K told me that she seems to be associated with a local terrorist group called the GIP.

Morridow: Oh... The German Independence Party.

Morridow: That's a far-right organization with quite a lot of influence. It was outlawed several years ago as they've grown increasingly violent.

Morridow: The party's nominal manifesto is to push for economic and political reforms, prioritizing the livelihood of residents in the Green and White Zones. However, they're against the current asylum and migration policies and want nothing to do with governing the contamination zone. Basically, they're a bunch of racists.

Morridow: Ever since the refugee camps were set up in Bremen, murders targeting refugees have skyrocketed. All evidence uncovered by the police points toward this organization.

Angelia: Why would Leone be associated with the GIP?

Morridow: The GIP has always had some odd capital flow. The Flora Institute might be one of their money laundering channels.

Morridow: Even though the party has been outlawed, they still seem to have a lot of support from different organizations. Many citizens also aid them in secret.

Angelia: Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this...

Angelia: How unsettling.

Angelia: This GIP isn't directly related to our current investigation.

Angelia: If we're to go down this route, our only lead is the call logs on her phone.

Morridow: So you screened all the individuals who've had dealings with her?

Morridow: But of all her callers, why the director of the Berle Orphanage?

Angelia: I received a tip-off.

Morridow: And it tells you the orphanage smells fishy?

Morridow: That's why you think the housemother may be one of Leone's collaborators?

Morridow: That sounds a bit far-fetched... A cultist who studies plants and an orphanage director who takes care of kids...

Morridow: I just don't see a connection.

Angelia: That's why it's so suspicious.

Angelia: I hope the housemother will satisfy our curiosity.

Morridow: You're right, we'll find out when we meet her!

Morridow: Frau Isabelle is a very venerable figure in the neighborhood. I'm sure she can give us a lot of information.

Morridow: I have a feeling that this will be our breakthrough!

Angelia: I just hope you're not mistaken.

Morridow: Oh, we're here. Ten past nine, not too bad.

Angelia: We're ten minutes later than your ETA...

As the car drives through the main gates, they see a few dozens of children standing in two lines. Led by a graceful woman with silver hair, they start waving at the car.

???: Ready, children...

Children: Nos rêves si solitaires qui nous protègent contre toutes les peurs...

Children: Nos rêves si sincères qui nous éveillent nous donnant des ailes... ♪

Ange gets out of the car and follows Morridow toward the entourage. Among the group of mostly blond children, a few dark-haired ones stand out and draw her eyes.

Children: On n'oublie jamais le sourire des sœurs... ♪

Children: Des mots gravant à jamais sur la pierre... ♪

Children: L'espoir d'une vie retrouvée. ♪

Children: La...la...la...la... ♪

The silver-haired woman gestures with her hand and the children's singing comes to a stop.

Morridow: That was wonderful! Thank you, Frau Krone, for treating us to such sweet music.

Morridow: We apologize for keeping you waiting for so long. There was an accident on the road, please do forgive us.

Krone: There is nothing to forgive, Frau Morridow!

Krone: It is our greatest honor that PECMAR representatives deem our humble orphanage worth a visit.

Krone: These children really do desperately need the Convention's aid. We haven't been waiting for long; it was no trouble at all.

Morridow: Thank you for being so understanding, Frau Krone.

Morridow: Hello, children. We are representatives of the Pan-European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Reconstruction, here on behalf of Chairwoman Ulrich. I am Morridow, her personal secretary, and this is Frau Angelia.

Morridow: The chairwoman has sent us to hear you out. Feel free to tell us whatever you need and how we may help you.

The children seem to be exhausted. They stare at Morridow blankly.

Krone immediately jumps in.

Krone: Hahaha, these children still have much to learn about manners, please don't take this personally.

Krone: It must have been a rough journey. The housemother is still waiting for you. Frau Morridow, Frau Angelia, this way please.

Krone turns abruptly. Her smile vanishes and her face grows stern.

Krone: Neele, Karin, lead the rest of the children back to the classroom.

Krone: Hands behind your back, start walking! Lillian, stop crying!

Lillian: (Sobs) I want Housemother...

Children: Tsk, Lillian is crying again.

Children: She's always whining for Housemother. Such a crybaby...

The girl called Lillian is very small. Being told off by the teacher only makes her cry harder. The other children start whispering to each other restlessly.

Krone: Silence! Lillian, don't make a fuss in front of our guests. Come here, I'll take you to Housemother.

Krone: Sorry for that. Lillian is still very young. The housemother says that she requires special attention.

Morridow: Oh, no worries. We understand that young toddlers do require extra care.

Krone: Thank you for your understanding.

Krone: Adam? Adam, are you there?

Adam: Frau Krone, what can I do for you?

Krone: Go and patrol the grounds with André.

Adam: But I'm just a temp, not a security guard.

Krone: With the representatives here, we must be on our guard!

Krone: What if more vagrants come stealing from us again?

André: Let's go, Adam. Stop complaining.

Adam: Argh... Why am I always doing things I didn't sign up for?

Angelia: Is that really necessary?

Angelia: We have a few bodyguards with us. They can watch the gates.

Krone: I'm really sorry, Frau Angelia.

Krone: Refugees have been breaking into our property to steal from our food stores for the last couple of days...

Krone: Nothing serious have happened, but it would be terrible if any of the children got hurt.

Krone: Not to mention we have such esteemed guests today...

Angelia: You're right, for the sake of the children, we must take this security issue seriously.

Angelia: Hopps, take your men to secure the front gates and entrance.

Hopps: Yes, ma'am.

Angelia: Lucia, Renate, you two come with me.

Angelia: Antje and Erwin, accompany the staff on their patrol and identify potential risks.

AN-94: Understood.

AK-15: Understood.

Adam: P...Patrol?

Adam: Two women?

Adam: Don't get me wrong, but these refugee syndicates are nothing to sneeze at.

Adam: If they come across female targets, they'll do a lot worse than mugging them.

Angelia: Don't worry, my subordinates have all undergone rigorous training.

Angelia: They can easily handle ten of you.

Angelia: No vagrant will dare enter this orphanage with them here.

Krone: Since Frau Angelia is so confident, you don't have to worry too much.

Adam: A...Alright...

Morridow: The staff doesn't seem to have realized that they're Dolls?

Angelia: I made sure their disguise is on point for this operation. Most people won't be able to tell the difference.

Angelia: Our job is to investigate. They'll have to communicate with a lot of civilians.

Angelia: It's wise not to advertise their true identity.

Morridow: You...you have a point.

Krone: Then please follow me.

Angelia: We're right behind you.

...

Krone: It's a bit dark in here. Watch your steps.

Krone: The housemother has been looking forward to your arrival. She was already telling me that the future of Berle Orphanage rests entirely on you.

Morridow: Right, Chairwoman Ulrich sent us to see what there is that we can do.

Morridow: The housemother's tireless effort in keeping the orphanage running so that these poor children have a roof above their heads is truly commendable, especially under current circumstances.

Krone: I'm sure she will be extremely heartened by your generous praise. This way, please.

Morridow and Krone keep up the small talk until the company reaches the door to the housemother's office.

The door is slightly ajar. Krone knocks on it lightly, but there is no reply. Lillian's tiny hand suddenly clutches tightly at the teacher's skirts.

Krone: Housemother, are you there? The representatives are here.

The teacher pushes the door open, only to reveal a dreadful scene.

Krone: Housemother??

A middle-aged woman is sprawled on the floor. Her puffy bluish face indicates that she has been dead for quite some time.

Morridow: Aaaaaah!

Angelia: Get out of the room, all of you!

Angelia: Lucia, examine the body.

Angelia: Renate, check the office.

Angelia: Collect visual records for everything.

AK-12 & RPK-16: Roger.

AK-12: Cause of death appears to be asphyxiation. Time of death is at around 6 this evening.

RPK-16: There is clear evidence of physical struggle. The drawers and cabinets have been rummaged.

RPK-16: All valuables have gone missing. On the surface, it looks like a robbery and murder.

Angelia: On the surface, huh...

Angelia: Ms. Krone, are there any surveillance cameras or security system in here?

Krone: Uh... N-No...

Krone: Due to the lack of funds... We can't afford such equipment...

Angelia: I understand.

Angelia: Morridow, call the police. Make sure you ask them when they will arrive.

Morridow: Um...

Angelia: Do it now!

Morridow: R-Right!

Once everyone has their orders, Ange starts inspecting the room herself. Documents are scattered everywhere, covering the floor like a layer of snow.

A breeze blows in through the slightly open window and sends a few sheets fluttering on the desk.

She studies the corpse on the floor and frowns.

Angelia: A robbery and murder...?

Angelia: The timing seems too much of a coincidence.

...

Krone: Frau Angelia, the...the housemother...

Angelia: She's not breathing.

Krone: Oh god...

Krone: How did this happen...?

Just then, Hopps, having heard Morridow's startled scream, comes charging in from the hallway.

Hopps: What's going on? Morridow told me the housemother was murdered in her office. Has there been a robbery?

Angelia: We can't tell for certain... But judging by the preliminary assessment of the crime scene, that does seem to be the case.

Angelia: I need your help. Seal the orphanage and don't let anyone in or out.

Hopps: I'm on it.

Krone: A robbery...?

Krone: Why would anyone do such a thing to the housemother?!

Krone: We've been devoting all our effort in doing good! What have we done to deserve this?!

Krone: Could it be the thieving refugees?

Krone: We didn't pursue the matter any further, but they still killed the housemother in cold blood!

Hopps: The refugees don't care what kind of charity you've done. To them, all locals are fair game.

Angelia: Antje, are you still outside?

AN-94: Yes.

Angelia: Check the surroundings. If someone had broken into the orphanage, they must've left traces.

AN-94: Understood. Erwin and I will start looking for clues.

Lillian: Noooo! No way! Not Housemother! This can't be real!

Lillian, having slipped into the office, clings to her stuffed toy in a death grip.

Krone: Lillian, what are you doing in here?! Get out. Housemother wouldn't want you to see this.

Lillian: This can't be real!

Krone: Go back to the others. Don't make a scene.

Lillian: (Wails) I...I'm not!

Lillian drops her stuffed toy as Krone forcefully drags her out of the room.

Ange walks toward to it and picks it up.

It looks raggedy and almost silly, but as she holds it in her hand, she has a feeling that there's more to this doll.

Lillian: Give it back!

Lillian: Housemother made it for me!

Lillian: She gave it to me herself!

Ange walks over to Lillian, kneels down, and hands the stuffed toy back to the girl.

Lillian hugs it vehemently. She is practically burrowing her head into it.

Angelia: I'm sorry.

Angelia: It must be very important to you.

Lillian glances at Ange quickly out of the corner of her eye and gives her a small nod.

Krone: I'm really sorry, Frau Angelia. I'll get the girl out of here.

Ange pats Lillian gently on the head and notices a slight change in the way the girl looks at her.

Just as she is about to say something, Krone whisks her out of the room and slams the door behind her.
Part 2: Piper

Hint: For the sake of continuity, please read this excerpt after you have completed "Sweet Dreams Box - Beginning".

...

Even before the police arrive at the scene, Ange has already got Berle Orphanage sealed off as Task Force DEFY starts collecting evidence.

The children have been gathered in the music room. Krone is giving them a lesson to keep them calm.

Krone: ..."Look, the rats start following him."

Krone: "As if totally entranced, the rats trail after the Pied Piper mindlessly. The music draws them to the river, and the mesmerized rats jump into the water one after the other, until they all get washed away..."

RPK-16 enters the music room and takes a seat in the back.

Neele: I know! The townspeople later refuse to give the Pied Piper his due reward and only offer a single gold coin for his service, so the Pied Piper plays his pipe and kidnaps all the children from the town.

Neele: Frau Krone, the housemother has told this story many times!

Krone: Silence! Mind your manners in front of our guest.

Upon noticing RPK-16 sitting in the back, the lively and boisterous children immediately grow hushed and uneasy.

RPK-16: Ahaha, don't mind me.

RPK-16: Just think of me as Frau Krone's assistant.

Krone: That...that won't do at all!

RPK-16: In spite of the tragedy that has struck the orphanage, the investigation is still in progress.

RPK-16: We would like to keep aiding the orphanage in its operation depending on the situation.

Krone: Are...are you sure?

RPK-16: Of course. That's why if there's anything you want, do go ahead and tell me, okay? I'm a magician who can make wishes come true.

RPK-16 reaches into her pocket and fishes out sweets that she has prepared beforehand. The children immediately have her surrounded with glowing eyes.

She smiles as all the sweets are seized up in an instant.

Blue-eyed Boy: Hurray! Another nice lady with lots of candy!

RPK-16: Another?

Blue-eyed Boy: The dark-haired lady with you had also given us lots of snacks before!

Blue-eyed Boy: Pity she isn't here right now.

RPK-16: Dark-haired lady... You mean Miss Morridow?

A girl with light blond hair shuffles closer. RPK-16 sees her and hands her another piece of candy.

The girl shakes her head and does not accept it.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Um...

RPK-16: Call me Renate.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Renate, what will happen to us with Housemother gone?

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Will we be sent somewhere else? Will we have to starve?

RPK-16: Hm...?

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Both my parents are missing. Housemother took me in.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: She said I could stay here for as long as I want. But if Housemother isn't here anymore... Will the orphanage also close down...?

RPK-16: Well...

Blue-eyed Boy: Dummkopf! What a silly question! With Housemother gone, there'll be no one to tell us off and we can eat as much as we want!

Children: Yay! Hahahahahahaha...

The young children laugh and seem altogether unaffected by what happened, but the older ones look considerably more worried.

They look expectantly at RPK-16, hoping she could give them some definite answers.

RPK-16 smiles. She could easily make up something to comfort these children, but just as the words reach the tip of her tongue, she stops.

RPK-16: Don't worry. There will be a way.

The blond girl looks visibly disappointed. She has heard such perfunctory reassurance all too many times.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Housemother said we had to stay where she could see us or the demons would snatch us away.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: The demons have already got to a few of my friends. Now that Housemother is gone, will the demons come again?

RPK-16: Demons?

The children fall silent. Their fear is palpable.

Tears are trailing down the blond girl's face.

Even the blue-eyed boy looks down with unease.

RPK-16: Ms. Krone... What's the deal with these demons?

Krone: I'm sorry, we shouldn't talk about such things in front of the children. Let's speak somewhere else.

Krone gestures to RPK-16.

The Doll gets the message and follows her out of the music room.

Krone: Apologies. That must have been very confusing.

RPK-16: Hm, it didn't sound like mere fairy tales.

RPK-16: I would like to know more about their "demons".

Krone: (Sighs) I suppose there's no way we can hide this from you any longer.

Krone: Now that the housemother is dead, there's no point in hiding it anyway.

RPK-16: What have you been hiding?

Krone: To tell you the truth...there have been four cases of missing children at the orphanage...

Krone: Every time it happened, the child was present at dinner but nowhere to be found the next morning during roll call.

Krone: After the first child had gone missing, in an attempt to prevent it from happening again, we gathered all the children and kept them in one place at a time. However, children still kept going missing.

RPK-16: Did you not call the police?

Krone: We did, but police investigation was inconclusive.

Krone: They couldn't care less that a few orphans disappeared.

Krone: I once suggested to Housemother that we could hire journalists to report the cases in the papers.

Krone: But she was worried that the bad press would endanger the operation of the orphanage, so I gave up on that idea.

Krone: Still, weird rumors started circulating that our orphanage was involved in child trafficking...

RPK-16: Child trafficking?

Krone: They were all baseless rumors, you must believe me!

Krone: The housemother handpicked all our teachers and caretakers from the local churches! I swear to God we would never do something so abominable!

Krone: We really do love these children. We don't want any harm to come to them.

RPK-16: Has security been tightened since the incidents?

Krone: We've arranged for the security guards to rotate shifts; I myself have also patrolled the dormitories through the night a few times.

Krone: But whenever it happened, I would always find myself passed out for some reason, and by the time I woke up, a child would be gone.

Krone: The guards would also say that they hadn't noticed anything unusual...

RPK-16: Hm...

Krone: The housemother was devastated; I could sense her dismay.

Krone: I've always heard that some refugees would resort to abducting children and selling them for money. Now they even had the audacity to target the housemother.

RPK-16: You believe this was the refugees' doing?

Krone: It...it was just a guess.

Krone: I can't think of anyone who would be so ruthless.

RPK-16: Did the housemother have any enemies or rivals?

Krone: She devoted her life to doing good... How could she have any enemies?

Krone: And she was a philanthropist - what rival could there be?

RPK-16: No suspects then...

Krone: (Sighs) Without the housemother, I'm afraid these poor children will have to suffer.

RPK-16: Why is that?

Krone: This could very well be the end of the orphanage.

RPK-16: Can't anyone succeed the housemother in her position? I believe you're a suitable candidate.

Krone sighs and shakes her head.

Krone: The housemother kept the orphanage running with her own savings. Money has always been tight supporting so many children. With the housemother gone, we will soon run out...

Krone: And due to the cases with the missing children, no one would be willing to help out an orphanage that allegedly participates in child trafficking...

Krone: Our only hope was receiving funding from PECMAR, but now that you've learned of what happened, I doubt our application would be approved...

RPK-16: So why did you tell me about this?

Krone: Once the police gets here, you and the other representatives will find out about our history soon enough.

Krone: I thought it would be better if you hear about it from me.

RPK-16: I see. I appreciate your honesty. I will liaise with the commissioner regarding your PECMAR funding.

RPK-16: Oh... I do have another question; it could be a bit impertinent.

Krone: Go ahead, I will not take offense.

RPK-16: Did you enter the housemother's office this evening?

Krone: I was with the children the whole time, preparing for your arrival. The children can testify for me.

RPK-16: And you didn't leave them, not even for a little?

Krone: Oh... I did head outside for a short while.

Krone: It started storming after dinner, a little after 6pm.

Krone: Some of the younger children were spooked by the loud thunder and started crying.

Krone: Lillian is particularly afraid of thunderstorms and kept asking for the housemother. I couldn't soothe her, so I phoned the housemother.

Krone: She said she would take care of Lillian and asked me to bring the girl to her office. I did as she asked me, then I returned to the hall to read.

Krone: After a while, the housemother told me to collect Lillian and take her back to the hall. I don't remember the exact time, but I'm certain it was before 8.

Krone: I knew because I definitely heard the rose cuckoo clock chiming the time inside the housemother's office while I was escorting Lillian down the hallway.

RPK-16: Which means the housemother was still alive at 8 o'clock.

Krone: I believe so.

Krone: Other than the clock, I didn't hear anything else coming from the office.

Krone: Lillian was with me; she can back me up.

RPK-16: Whoever broke into the housemother's office must've made quite a ruckus.

RPK-16: Didn't anyone hear anything at all?

Krone: Her office is located in the deepest section of the building and some distance away from the hall.

Krone: Besides, it's been raining very heavily throughout the evening.

Krone: Neither the children nor I heard anything unusual...

RPK-16: Then congratulations. If everything you said is true, you are completely in the clear.

RPK-16: One last question - apart from you, who else has free access to this main building?

Krone: Other staff members can also enter and exit the building, but they have all gone home since it's late.

Krone: I only stayed behind to receive your party.

Krone: The security personnel also has a set of keys. Herr André, whom you've met earlier, is on duty tonight.

Krone: The only other person I can think of is Herr Adam, our handyman. The housemother occasionally had him run some errands, so he also has the keys to the rooms.

RPK-16: Thank you, I now have a general picture of the situation.

RPK-16: That's all for now.

Krone: (Sighs) I feel somewhat better, having come clean about what happened.

Krone: The world is cruel enough as it is, so why are the kind-hearted never rewarded for their good deeds?

Krone: Even the previous housemother passed away because of heart disease. Poor woman, she was still so young.

Krone: I wish God had more mercy on the good.

RPK-16: Ange, I'm sending you everything I've logged.

Angelia: Received. Thanks, this will be very helpful.

RPK-16: Have you figured it out?

Angelia: Patience. We are very close to the truth.
Part 3: Cuckoo Clock

Hint: For the sake of continuity, please read this excerpt after you have completed "Sweet Dreams Box - Beginning".

...

The rain starts letting up at midnight.

There is a large tree just outside the window of the housemother's office. The dense foliage is reflected on the glass, blocking out most of the light.

Inside the office, AK-12 is scouring the crime scene carefully.

AK-12: Where to begin?

AK-12: ...
If choice 1 was picked

Time of death - around 9pm yesterday. Cause of death - asphyxiation.

There are clear strangulation marks on the neck and bruises on the body.

Liquid is found dripping out of the victim's mouth—smells like anesthetic.

A section of her shirt is tucked inside her pants.

Next to the body is a piece of sturdy hemp rope, which seems to be the murder weapon.

The rope bears signs of having been cut by a sharp implement. Bits of wood is stuck between the plies in the middle section of the rope.

Also close to the body is a fallen chair. One of the legs has been torn off.

The broken leg of the chair is found by the housemother's hand. She might have used it to defend herself against her assailant.

The struggle did not last too long. The housemother was soon overpowered and killed.
If choice 2 was picked

A photo frame lies face-down on the desk. Inside the frame is a black and white photograph of a smiling girl. "Emma, meine Liebe" is scribbled in the bottom right corner of the photo.

Also on the desk is an empty notebook missing several pages. There is a light imprint of written words on the inside cover.

Two partial footprints can be found on the edge of the desk.

The bookshelves have been toppled, books spilling all over the place.

The safe was pried open and emptied.

A purse lies discarded on the floor. It only contains the housemother's identification card, no cash.

One of the wooden beams in the office bears signs of abrasion.

A receipt has been carefully taped to the bottom of the drawer. It reads, "W, Sweet Dreams Box - the very last one. Consignee, Powell."
If choice 3 was picked

Documents are strewn across the floor. Footprints can be found on the papers. Judging by their sizes and gaits, three distinct individuals seem to have walked over the documents.

The third set of footprints were created at a different time than the other two.

There doesn't appear to be anything noteworthy about the scattered documents and books.

The trash can in the corner contains a discarded piece of wet towel that emits a similar odor to the smell of the victim's mouth.

The assailant might have attempted to sedate the housemother with anesthetic but resorted to murder after they failed.

There are multiple scrape marks on the floor, possibly the caused by the physical struggle between the housemother and her assailant.
If choice 4 was picked

The door to the office does not seem to have been forced open. There is a marked absence of dust over a small area on the wall to the left of the door frame.

A seamless nail is attached to the dust-free area, which suggests something used to hang there.

Two greasy fingerprints can be found on the glass of the half-closed window, possibly left by the thumb and index finger of a left hand.

A muddy field of grass lies outside the window, but no tracks can be found due to the thunderstorm.

On the surface of a dry area sheltered from the rain outside the window is a row of footprints pointing outwards, possibly left by the culprit while fleeing the scene.

Search complete. Clues collected include...

A piece of rope with bits of wood caught in the plies, a receipt mentioning a consignee, footprints left by three people, a dust-free patch on the wall to the left of the door frame, a set of footprints outside the window.

AK-12: ...

AK-12 leaves the housemother's office. As she reaches the main entrance, Adam the handyman is being questioned by Hopps.

Adam: Oh, come now, kind sir! As I've told you many times already, I've been guarding the gates with you the whole time! How could I be the culprit?

Hopps: What about before we arrived?

Hopps: What were you doing?

Adam: The housemother summoned me. Since our meeting wasn't going to take place until later during the night, I found a room and took a snooze inside.

Hopps: What did the housemother want with you at such a late hour?

Adam: Uh... She wanted me to help with getting the books in order for this month and run some errands for her.

Hopps: Bookkeeping? So late at night? What are you hiding? Spit it out.

Adam: The...the housemother was usually very busy. Bookkeeping can be done anytime, right?

Hopps: ...

AK-12: Have you found out anything worth knowing, Mr. Hopps?

Hopps: This guy looks pretty suspicious no matter how you cut it.

Adam: But you've got no evidence!

Adam: Gosh, what rotten luck. I was hoping I could go home and turn in early tonight.

AK-12: Mr. Hopps, why don't you investigate something else and let me chat with Adam for a bit?

Hopps: ...Alright, but don't let him get away.

AK-12: If he tries to run, he'll have to worry about his femurs.

Adam: You may be a beauty, but you sure are hella scary!

Hopps shoots Adam one last glare before taking his leave.

AK-12: So, Adam, where should we start?

Adam: As I've said, I'm just a simple handyman. I don't know much about anything else.

AK-12: Right, you were telling Mr. Hopps about bookkeeping.

AK-12: I'm guessing you were trying to settle the account for the Sweet Dreams Box transaction?

AK-12 waves the receipt in Adam's face. The handyman lets out a sigh at the sight of the slip of paper.

Adam: I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

AK-12: Well, aren't you forthcoming.

Adam: It probably wasn't too difficult to find. From what I know about the housemother, she couldn't have hidden it very well.

Adam: So what's your working theory?

Adam: Just to make it clear, I'm honestly not the culprit.

AK-12: Of course you aren't.

AK-12: The housemother asked you to transport something called a Sweet Dreams Box from the orphanage. The delivery must be carried out under the cover of night, so you showed up at her office at the agreed time. You knocked but nobody answered the door.

AK-12: You left, but you weren't happy about being stood up, so you returned and peered inside the office through the window. That's when you realized it wasn't locked. You climbed in through the window and found the housemother dead.

AK-12: However, you did not want to leave empty-handed.

AK-12: You rummaged through her shelves for something valuable, but you probably didn't have much luck since the room was already turned upside down.

AK-12: In the end, you took the cuckoo clock that was hanging on the wall to the left of the door. Your trail around the office could easily be tracked by the footprints you left on the documents strewn across the floor.

AK-12: You've got a good eye. That gold rose is probably the most valuable thing about the cuckoo clock. That's what you took it for, I suppose?

Adam: So it's made of gold?

Adam: Okay, let's say you're right.

AK-12: Could you explain the task that the housemother gave you?

Adam: Well...long story.

Adam: I'm mostly in charge of transporting supplies at Berle Orphanage. Sometimes I run some personal errands for the housemother, such as delivering the Sweet Dreams Boxes mentioned on the receipt.

Adam: I've carried out four deliveries altogether. I was rewarded very handsomely for every run I made.

Adam: The housemother warned me that I mustn't be spotted moving those boxes so the deliveries always took place in the middle of the night.

AK-12: What exactly is a Sweet Dreams Box?

Adam: A custom wooden crate made with three-ply wood panels. Pretty sturdy. About 150 by 80 centimeters.

AK-12: What's inside?

Adam: Haven't a clue. All the boxes were handed to me tightly sealed. She said they were full of knick-knacks handmade by the children - gifts for those in high society, urging them to make donations to the orphanage.

Adam: But the boxes were really heavy. What do you think was inside?

AK-12: This consignee, Powell. Do you know them?

Adam: I'd also like to know who that is. They're the reason I'm here.

Adam: Sadly, I was always told to deliver the boxes to a designated spot and they would only be moved after I was gone.

Adam: So God knows who took those boxes and where they hauled them.

AK-12: They're the reason you're here?

AK-12: What do you mean?

Adam: I've already told you everything I know. You'll have to figure out the rest yourselves, Frau Lucia.

Adam: Your enemy seems more stupid than I imagined.

...

André the security guard reported a sighting of intruders last night. Ange has sent AN-94 to the security room to investigate.

AN-94 arrives at the security room just as André is seeing Hopps off.

AN-94: Mr. André, Miss Angelia sent me. Apparently you have clues pertaining to the intruders?

André: Frau...Antje, right?

AN-94: Yes, that is my name.

André: I did discover something unusual, but most of it has been washed away by the rain.

André: It's probably nothing, to be honest.

AN-94: It doesn't matter. Let's take a look at the scene.

André: Say, shouldn't we leave this kind of stuff to the police?

André: I know you are the representatives' bodyguards, but is it really necessary for you to get involved?

AN-94: Miss Morridow has contacted the police, but their arrival is being delayed by the storm, that's why we would like to conduct a preliminary investigation ourselves.

André: Uh...

André: Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you, young lady.

André: Refugees have been banding together to rob properties in this area for quite a while now. The housemother most probably also died at their hands.

André: I hate the idea of going beyond the fence in the middle of the night.

AN-94: Don't worry, just take me to the general location.

André: Alright... You're not giving me much choice.

André: Come along then.

André leads AN-94 north. She didn't notice before, but mountains form a natural barrier that spans across the northern side of the orphanage. The surrounding fence is only built on the other three sides.

AN-94: So there are mountains behind Berle Orphanage. I didn't notice that on the way here.

André: Those mountains are a serious security issue for us. We've discovered that refugees use them as shelters. We've even found bedding and over two weeks' worth of food scraps in there...

AN-94: If there are hideouts in the mountains, then it is a lot more likely that the intruder broke into the housemother's office from the outside...

AN-94: Did the housemother not take any measures to tighten security in the north?

André: That costs money.

André: I'm still owed several months' worth of my salary.

André: But I didn't make a fuss for the sake of the kids.

André: It was very kind of the housemother to provide for orphans who came from the contamination zones.

André: It's always the poor who try to save others while the rich only think about their own comfort.

AN-94: I see...

André: The housemother was really down on her luck. Those refugees must've had their eyes on her for some time.

André: I doubt I can stay here much longer myself. I'd better look for another job at a safer place.

AN-94: You've done your best.

André: Right, we're here.

André: Dammit, the rain has washed everything away. There were a few footprints here before.

AN-94: I understand. Just leave the rest to me and return to the orphanage.

André: Huh?

André: You're heading into the mountains?

André: That's way too dangerous.

AN-94: It's alright. For your safety, please return to the hall and wait for me.

AN-94: I will return, I promise.

André: Well... Good luck then.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: Erwin, do you copy?

AK-15: Loud and clear. What's the situation?

AN-94: The security guard led me to the location where he had previously discovered evidence left behind by a possible intruder. The soil has definitely been disturbed here.

AN-94: I suspect it bears footprints that were erased by the rain. I'm about to follow them.

AK-15: Do you require backup?

AN-94: Keep up your own investigation. I'll get in touch if I need help.

AK-15: Understood. Be careful.

AN-94 follows the trail into the mountains.

She finally finds what she's after deep inside.

She pushes a patch of shrubbery aside and reveals a round black manhole cover made of metal with a ring pull attached.

The ring pull feels a little greasy. Somebody must have used it recently.

AN-94: A manhole cover? Why would there be a manhole cover in such a place? Ange, are you seeing this?

Angelia: Yes. Look around and show me your surroundings.

AN-94: The grass here looks like it's been stepped on.

AN-94: The ring pull has also been used.

Angelia: There shouldn't be a manhole in the mountains. Open the cover and see what's down there.

AN-94: Roger.

AN-94 lifts the metal cover with a single hand. A pungent odor of decay wafts through the opening. The hole looks pitch dark and bottomless.

AN-94: It's big, a meter in diameter.

Angelia: Shine your flashlight in there.

AN-94: Okay.

AN-94: Hm?!

All of a sudden, someone clamps a hand over AN-94's mouth and slashes her throat with a blade.

AN-94 loses her balance and tumbles into the dark manhole, then the manhole cover is put back in place and sealed tight.

AN-94 finds her bearing at the bottom of the pit. Her automatic self-diagnostics indicate that she has only suffered minor damage.

Angelia: What just happened, Antje?!

Angelia: Are you alright?!

AN-94: I'm...fine...

AN-94: I was attacked...

AN-94: I didn't sense anyone behind me at all...

Angelia: Glad to hear you're okay. Damage report.

AN-94: My assailant tried to slash my throat, but the cut wasn't deep and didn't damage any important components. I will close the wound temporarily with some sealing gel.

AN-94: They must have thought I was human, or they wouldn't have attacked me with this method.

Angelia: You're lucky you're a Doll.

Angelia: Stay where you are. Erwin and I are coming to get you.

AN-94: Acknowledged... But this doesn't seem like a nice place at all.

AN-94 turns on her flashlight. The illuminated scene confirms what her other senses have suggested.

The bottom of the manhole is covered by a layer of countless white bones. On the top of the pile are two little skeletons garbed in uniforms of the orphanage. Their hollow gaze seems to bore right into her.
Part 5: Rag Doll

...

Angelia: The girl that got led away... She seems a little unusual.

Morridow: Frau Krone told me that Lillian bears a very close resemblance to the housemother's own daughter.

Angelia: The housemother has a daughter?

Morridow: Had. I believe the child is deceased.

Angelia: I see... No wonder the housemother had a soft spot for her.

Morridow: It must be devastating for the girl to lose someone so close to her again.

Angelia: The only thing we can do is find the culprit.

Angelia: Come to think of it, you've been sticking to me like glue the whole time.

Angelia: That was quite a fright for you too, wasn't it? Why don't you find somewhere to sit down and take a break?

Morridow: The chairwoman has bade me to make myself useful! I can't fall apart at such a crucial moment!

Morridow: There might be something you need my help with!

Angelia: In that case, you could do me a favor.

Outside the music room, a few of the bigger children have Lillian surrounded.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Oh dear, Lillian, Crybaby Lillian. Without Housemother, who's going to indulge such a crybaby now?

Blue-eyed Boy: Crybaby Lillian, Tattletale Lillian. Let's see who'll come to your rescue this time.

Girl with a Ponytail: You're so mean. Stop bullying Lillian!

Girl with a Ponytail: Lillian, your "Singing Emma" is so hideous. Why don't you give it to me and I'll make the others leave you in peace? How about that?

Lillian: (Cries) No! I'm not letting you have Emma! Housemother—

Morridow: What are you playing, children? May I join you?

Girl with a Ponytail: Humph, the representatives running to Lillian's rescue.

Girl with Light Blond Hair: Gotta hand it to you. Somehow you always manage to summon help with your pathetic crying.

Blue-eyed Boy: We're not playing with you! You're taking Lillian's side!

Morridow: I know you're kids, but you've got to learn some respect. You. Must. Not. Bully. Your. Friend.

Morridow widens her eyes dramatically as she admonishes the children bullying Lillian. They pause for a moment in surprise before finally scattering.

With tear-streaked face, Lillian is led up to Ange. Clutching her doll tightly, she rubs at her eyes with a grimy hand and looks up at Ange.

Angelia: You can call me Ange.

Morridow: And I'm Morridow~

Lillian remains silent. Perceiving her timidness, Morridow fishes out a sweet and places it in the girl's hand.

Lillian accepts the sweet and carefully slips it into her pocket.

Lillian: Ange... Morridow... Have you caught the person who hurt Housemother?

Angelia: Not yet, but I think we'll find them very soon.

Angelia: There's something you wanted to tell me before you left the room, right?

Lillian: Huh...?

Angelia: I saw it in your eyes.

Lillian: Um... Frau Ange, you're one of the delegates, right?

Angelia: That's right.

Lillian: Then...are you a good person?

Morridow: Good person?

Lillian: Housemother said I mustn't let anyone other than the good person on the delegation know about what she told me.

Angelia: I'm not sure about the others, but I suppose I am a good person.

Morridow: Uh... I believe I also count as one?

Lillian peers at Morridow apprehensively and shakes her head.

Morridow: Wow... I'm a bit offended. I just gave you candy, you know.

Angelia: Feel free to tell me anything. Don't mind Morridow.

Lillian looks up at Ange and gives her a small nod. Ange leads the girl into a corner of the hall, out of Morridow's earshot.

Angelia: From what I've been told, you were the last person Housemother was with before she got attacked.

Angelia: Did she tell you anything? Can you describe what happened to me?

Lillian: Housemother said she wanted to mend my doll for me...so she asked Frau Krone to bring me to her office.

Lillian: Housemother scared me a little back then... She didn't say anything, just kept staring at me as she sewed up my doll.

Lillian: After a while, she started crying. I ran up to hug her and told her not to cry.

Angelia: She started crying?

Lillian: I don't know what made Housemother so sad...

Lillian: As I watched her cry, I...I also started crying... (Sobs)

Lillian: Housemother... (Sobs)

Lillian bursts into tears again as she recalls her final moments with the housemother.

Ange kneels quietly next to her, waiting for her to collect herself.

She keeps weeping and wiping away her tears with her hands.

Ange takes out a handkerchief and dries the girl's face.

After a while, she finally calms down. She looks up again at Ange, who nods at her encouragingly.

Lillian: Housemother saw that I was crying and wiped away my tears.

Lillian: She told me not to cry and started telling me stories.

Lillian: She would usually only tell me one story at a time, but back then she told me story after story, as if she was trying to tell me all the stories she had ever known...

Angelia: What happened next...?

Lillian: Then she said it was almost 8 and I should be going to bed, so she phoned Frau Krone to come and fetch me.

Lillian: She gave me back my mended doll and told me she had made up her mind.

Lillian: She said a delegation was coming, and a good person among them would be able to help us. She told me to give this doll to the person.

Lillian: Are you really a good person, Frau Ange?

Angelia: What do you think?

Lillian: I think...you remind me a lot of Housemother...

Lillian: So...

Lillian offers the doll in her arms to Ange. Ange takes it solemnly and looks it over.

On the back of the doll is a patchwork that obviously looks newly sewn on.

She applies some force to tear open the seam, revealing a folded piece of paper hidden inside the doll.

The paper is wrapped around a cross-shaped medal, which has the letter "W" etched on the back.

She unfolds the paper and scans its content before promptly shoving it into her pocket.

Lillian: What is that?

Angelia: It's a letter from Housemother, telling me that Lillian is a good girl.

Lillian: Housemother said I'm a good girl?

Ange turns and looks at Lillian with very gentle eyes.

Angelia: Lillian, you have done a brilliant job protecting Housemother.
Part 6: Sweet Dreams Box - End

    6chevron_right

At daybreak, word finally arrives that the police will be there soon. Ange's visit to Berle Orphanage also comes to an end.

Angelia: Hopps, could you please gather everyone here? I need to make an announcement.

Hopps: An announcement?

Hopps: What is it?

Angelia: Just do as I say.

Hopps: ...Okay, right away.

AK-12, RPK-16, AK-15, Krone, Morridow, Adam, and finally André file into the hall one after the other.

Ange glances at the exhausted Lillian, who has fallen asleep on the sofa, and orders AK-12 to carry her back to her bed.

Hopps: Frau Ange, that's everyone. The police will be here soon. I've already questioned all the suspects; I believe this was a robbery and murder perpetrated by refugees.

Hopps: The police can take over from here.

Angelia: What brings you to that conclusion?

Hopps: While the orphanage was in lockdown, I looked into all the suspects' alibis.

Hopps: Members of the delegation are obviously not suspects. André and Adam only arrived at the orphanage after the housemother's death.

Hopps: Krone was with the children the whole time.

Hopps: Nobody present has any motive for murdering the housemother. Who could it be if not an intruder?

Ange shakes her head.

Angelia: It's true that nobody present has a motive for murdering the housemother, but that doesn't mean the killer is an outsider.

Hopps: Then who murdered the housemother?

Ange sighs.

Angelia: Nobody murdered her. The housemother committed suicide.

The revelation triggers an immediate uproar. Krone cannot contain her shock.

Krone: Suicide? How could that be—

Angelia: The housemother took her own life to expose the truth, whereas the person who pushed her into making this decision destroyed the scene afterwards to undermine what she was trying to achieve.

Krone: Expose the truth?

Angelia: This case has been fraught with unexpected developments, but it was these developments that pointed me in the right direction.

Angelia: I've got to admit that this culprit was extremely clever to have come up with a plan to derail our investigation in such a short time.

Morridow: Derail our... What do you mean?

Angelia: They led us on a wild goose chase to look for the housemother's murderer when this murderer doesn't even exist.

Angelia: And while we were all distracted, the message that the housemother wanted to convey remained hidden.

Ange's gaze sweeps over everyone gathered in the hall, taking in their different expressions.

What she sees seems to have confirmed her suspicion. She clears her throat and continues.

Angelia: Let's start with their methods. They drew our attention using the crime scene.

Angelia: The broken chair leg, the messy footprints, the towel soaked with anesthetic...

Angelia: These were just decoys. The culprit destroyed the object that truly mattered.

Hopps: What object?

Angelia: The housemother's final confession.

Krone: Confession?

Angelia: Good thing I came across this medal she left behind.

Ange reveals the cross-shaped medal she found in Lillian's doll. It flashes black and crimson under the lights.

Angelia: This is an Iron Cross—a military decoration reintroduced by the former German Federation during the war and an insignia of the GIP.

Angelia: Many members of the organization are retired veterans, so those terrorists tend to identify themselves and each other using this medal.

Angelia: I believe it was no coincidence that the housemother was in possession of an Iron Cross. There is a GIP spy in this orphanage.

Krone: The GIP?!

Krone: You mean the terrorist organization?

Angelia: Exactly. There is a terrorist among you who has no business being in a philanthropic orphanage.

Angelia: Isn't that right, Mr. André?

André: !!!

Angelia: You may have destroyed the housemother's confession, but it's only a matter of time that we restore it after further investigation.

André: I don't know what you're talking about!

André: Are you accusing me of murder?

Angelia: No, as I said, the housemother wasn't murdered.

Angelia: But that doesn't mean you aren't a cold-blooded killer either.

André: I'm just an ordinary security guard...!

Angelia: Are you?

Angelia: You were no ordinary security guard when you went for my subordinate.

André: !!

Angelia: You managed to sneak up on her unnoticed—that's pretty impressive.

Angelia: You kept trying to blame this on refugees, but I gather you've already rounded up and killed all the refugees in the area.

Angelia: All those remains in the air-raid shelter must've been your handiwork, eh?

André: I honestly have no idea what this is all about! Can you even prove I had anything to do with what happened to your subordinate?

Angelia: She would've kicked the bucket if she were human.

Angelia: Unfortunately for you, she isn't, in fact, human, and you left your fingerprints all over her face.

Angelia: Make sure you know the difference between a human and a Doll next time you decide to attack one.

André: Tsk...!

Angelia: Got nothing else to say? Hands in the air—

André: —!

André suddenly draws a pistol and fires at Ange.

Much to everyone's surprise, Adam, who is standing closest to Ange, throws himself on her with unbelievable speed.

The bullet passes through where Ange was standing. Hopps immediately draws his own weapon and shoots André in the head, killing him instantly.

Angelia: So it really was you, J.

Angelia: I didn't know you were into playing dress-up.

J: Am I so handsome that no disguise can hide my charm?

Angelia: You prattled too much with Lucia. Thought no one would notice, did you?

J: I dropped the hint on purpose.

J: But you, big oaf! What the hell is wrong with you? I infiltrated this place and spent over a month undercover just to gain that GIP bastard's trust.

J: Do you have any idea how much effort it has taken the Stasi to uncover this lead?

Angelia: So you were working two jobs at the same time?

Hopps: Frau Ange's safety is my priority.

Angelia: Why, thank you.

Ange pushes J aside and scrambles to her feet.

She rummages through André's bloody clothes and pulls out another Iron Cross.

Angelia: He's been holding onto his.

Angelia: So it really was him. Sadly, he can't tell us anything now.

The police has the orphanage completely cordoned off.

Vehicles dispatched by the Stasi soon also arrive at the scene.

The other staff have been brought into the hall while Ange's company keep an eye on Krone and the frightened children on the second floor.

RPK-16: We've found Antje. She's fine.

RPK-16: But she did pick up a very interesting stench while she was in that hole. It probably won't come off even if she spends a whole night in the shower.

RPK-16: Bluffing him with his fingerprints when Antje was still trapped underground?

RPK-16: Very well played.

Angelia: Likewise.

Angelia: Run a full diagnostic on her. We have more to do tomorrow.

RPK-16: Always the slave driver.

RPK-16: But I'm afraid "Captain" Lucia won't let me do the honors.

Angelia: Just run the diagnostic and stand by. We'll be going soon.

There's a light knock on the door and J enters the room.

He has shed his disguise and returned to his usual appearance.

Angelia: Where's Hopps?

J: Being questioned by the police. You may be sent by PECMAR, but the proper procedures must still be observed.

Angelia: Proper procedures...?

Angelia: These cops with greasy palms had better not cover up the whole thing once we're gone.

J: Nonsense. The Stasi is involved in this case, you know.

Angelia: Since the Stasi is involved, why didn't you just bust this GIP den?

J: We're the Stasi, not your regular flatfoots.

J: There's no point in capturing a peon. Surely I don't need to explain that to you.

J: (Sighs) Why are you always so eager to ruin my cases?

Angelia: How long has the Stasi been preparing for this sting operation?

J: About half a year. We were hoping I could make my way into their mid-level cadre.

J: I've already told Frau Lucia all the inconsequential details of my story.

J: I've even got my hands on the delivery man and I would've soon got to the bottom of this.

J: But then you lot came charging in, and here we are, in the middle of this mess.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: Why did you enter the housemother's office at the risk of contaminating the scene?

J: I hid my voice recorder in that clock.

J: This orphanage may look pretty run-down, but the EM protection is top-tier.

J: All camera and bug signals are jammed. I'm guessing those in the GIP don't want any evidence to go on record.

J: While you were all busy fooling around, I saw André scurrying out of the trashed office.

J: After he left, I retrieved the recorder to see what really happened inside the office.

Angelia: Can I listen to the recording?

J: It's mostly the housemother telling Lillian stories in the first part, and I doubt you'd be interested in her shuffling about shortly before she died.

J: This is what you're after, isn't it?

André's Voice: Dammit, why now?!

André's Voice: I can't believe you'd betray us, but I won't let you get away with it!

It thunders just as the clock on the wall strikes the hour and starts chiming.

Angelia: The time checks out. This confirms my hypothesis.

Morridow: Now I'm confused... So did André kill the housemother?

Angelia: Weren't you listening? The housemother committed suicide.

Morridow: Then why did André suddenly try to shoot you...?

Angelia: Because he knew I saw through his ploy.

Morridow: What on earth does that even mean...?

Angelia: Read the housemother's letter.

Ange brings up a document on her tablet and shows it to Morridow.

Morridow: "Dear Frau Angelia, I am Isabelle, Housemother of Berle Orphanage.

Morridow: "I initially established this orphanage to make ends meet for myself, but as I got to know these children better, I became more and more determined to extend a helping hand to people who are not so fortunate.

Morridow: "Times are hard and keeping this institution running is extremely challenging. To safeguard the children's happiness, I have done something unforgivable to some of them.

Morridow: "I knew that Herr Powell is a member of the German Independence Party, but he made me an offer I simply could not refuse.

Morridow: "He told me that someone in high society would like to take custody of a few exceptional children. In return, they would make very generous donations that would keep the orphanage afloat.

Morridow: "Just as I thought I had secured all the children's happiness, I saw the corpses of the ones whom I had handpicked for adoption.

Morridow: "I realized that it was all a lie. If wealthy families wanted to adopt children, why would they be carried out in boxes?

Morridow: "I tried to report them to the authorities, but everyone, even the police, has been bought off. I am under constant surveillance as I helplessly watch the children disappear one after the other.

Morridow: "At this rate, the same fate will befall all the children here, and it will be my ignorance and stupidity that sends them to their deaths.

Morridow: "I am in a whirlpool that I cannot escape. My only option is to pay for my sins with my life. I hope my death will shed light on the wicked crimes that have been committed in this orphanage.

Morridow: "I beg you to protect the remaining children. It may be impertinent of me to ask this favor of you even though we have never met, please do forgive me."

Angelia: Do you understand now?

Morridow: So...the housemother only killed herself because we were coming?

Angelia: She said it in the letter. She had no other way of getting out of her predicament, so she pinned all her hopes on us.

Morridow: But didn't you say André had destroyed her confession? Then what is this...?

Angelia: The housemother was going to take her own life before we arrived, but it then occurred to her that someone might dispose of her letter, so she wrote another copy and sewed it into Lillian's doll. We only notified her shortly before our visit, which didn't give her much time to plan everything out carefully.

Angelia: But she must have been living in constant fear and anguish to have the resolve to give her life in exchange for the children's safety.

Angelia: Poor woman...

Morridow: So she left another copy of her letter...

Angelia: Yeah, good thing she took this precaution. Otherwise, the unexpected turn of events would have made it possible for the culprit to get away.

Morridow: Unexpected...turn of events?

Angelia: The fact that we showed up an hour late.

Angelia: The housemother was under surveillance 24/7; she had to time her suicide very carefully so that her plan wouldn't be discovered too soon by the people watching her.

Angelia: Lillian left her office at 8; the housemother was still alive then.

Angelia: She was planning to make her move shortly before our appointment to make sure no one could tamper with the scene.

Angelia: Unfortunately, we were delayed by an hour because of the storm and the traffic.

Angelia: According to J's recording, André found out that the housemother had killed herself at 9, but we were almost here already.

Angelia: To destroy all evidence before we arrived, he laid a few false trails at the scene.

Angelia: If it hadn't been for my DEFY Dolls, I wouldn't have figured out the truth so soon or identified the mole before the police got here.

Angelia: If the housemother was right and the police has been bought off by the GIP, then they will surely write this case off as a simple robbery.

Angelia: And once we're gone, the child trafficking operation will once again become obscured.

Angelia: The housemother will have died for nothing.

Morridow: I will report this to the chairwoman and she will put the police department from another region onto this case.

Morridow: But what's the deal with the remains in that underground air-raid shelter?

Angelia: The GIP hates refugees with a vengeance. I'm guessing André often busied himself with "cleaning up" the homeless refugees in the area.

Angelia: The small skeletons were probably children who suffocated in the boxes and their bodies just got dumped there.

Angelia: The housemother must've discovered them, and that's why she was so determined to expose the GIP.

Morridow: This is...outrageous...

Angelia: This place is too dangerous. The children cannot stay.

Angelia: I've got to hand it to the housemother. She must've known that with us at the scene, even these dirty cops can't do anything out of line.

Angelia: We can get the children out of here right under the GIP's nose.

Angelia: This was the best she could do as a show of defiance.

Morridow: I will get in touch with other orphanages and arrange for them to take in these children.

Morridow: Turning an orphanage into a child-trafficking den... Absolutely unforgivable.

Angelia: The world is rife with unforgivable sins.

Angelia: That's why people need to come forward and fight back, but that often comes at a heavy price. Sometimes at the cost of one's own life.

Hopps: Frauen, the police is done with us. We may return.

Angelia: Good, then let's go, Morridow.

Morridow: Oh, okay!

Ange suddenly stops when she gets to the door.

Morridow: What's the matter?

Angelia: Wait for me in the car. I need to talk to J about something.

Morridow: Uh...sure.

Morridow: Hopps, let's go.

Ange watches Hopps and Morridow leave the room and closes the door behind them. Then she turns around and faces J.

J looks expectantly at Ange, waiting for her questions.

Angelia: J, what can we learn from the information we have?

Angelia: Where were the missing children sent to?

J: We have been aware of what the housemother tried to expose for some time, but we haven't been able to get much out of Adam or the invoices.

J: Otherwise, I wouldn't have had to go undercover for so long.

Angelia: What if I give you this?

J: Is that...a bank account?

J: The real Adam's?

J: Understood. I'll get my people to look into it. We didn't find out about this account while investigating Adam.

J: Where did you find this?

Angelia: This is the actual, valuable lead that the housemother has left us in Lillian's doll.

J: Huh? Didn't you say she stuff her final letter inside the doll?

Angelia: Lucia recreated the letter by brushing over the writing imprint in the housemother's notebook with a pencil.

Angelia: There was never a second copy of the letter.

J: Then why did you...

Angelia: The housemother only wrote that letter as a decoy. What she really wanted us to find is this.

J: We should be able to learn a lot by cross-referencing the transaction records of this account with the invoices we found. I'll get on it.

Angelia: I'm counting on you.

Angelia: But I've got to remind you - the housemother went to such great lengths to maintain secrecy because she knew her enemy was close.

J: You mean...

Angelia: Like her, our common enemy could be right by our side. Some things are best kept on a need-to-know basis.

Angelia: I still don't trust you Stasi folks too much, but since you're in the same unit as K, I suppose that makes you more reliable than the rest of them.

Angelia: Once our target is confirmed, I want you with us.

J: Are you sure? I can request for more people from my superior.

Angelia: You know what my concern is. I need you to make sure there aren't any traitors in your ranks.

J: ...

J: I'll make the arrangements. Wait for my call.

Outside the refugee settlement.

J, who is dozing off against his car window, suddenly feels something ice cold pressed onto his face.

J: ...Who's that?!

Morridow: Pfft, you're sleeping just like that in the car? That's very careless~

J: M...Morridow?

J: How did you spot me?

Morridow: You stopped your car right on the roadside.

J: But it's disguised...

J: Uh, so you're also here with Ange? I thought...

Morridow: That we got left behind?

Morridow: No way we could let that happen. The chairwoman ordered us to keep Frau Ange safe, we can't possibly let her walk into danger on her own.

J: Somehow it feels more dangerous to have you along...

Morridow: Ha-ha, very funny. I'm a pro, you know?!

Morridow: Besides, Hopps is also with us. He'll make sure we're safe.

J: That big oaf... Are you sure he can handle this...?

Morridow: I mean, he used to be in the GSG 9. That sounds very reassuring.

Morridow: You, on the other hand, doesn't strike me as a special agent at all.

J: That's just a job. I don't want to turn into a boring stuffed-shirt with a poker face like that dude.

Morridow: You mean Herr Schwaben?

Morridow: I think he looks much more like a proper agent, don't you agree?

J: If an agent is instantly recognizable as an agent, he might as well be a dead man.

Morridow: Oooh~ Should I relay your friendly advice to a certain Herr Poker Face?

J: Ahem, forget about Herr Poker Face. Why don't we talk about something more interesting?

Morridow: More interesting?

J: I've come across a lot of girls in my work, but I've never seen anyone as cute as you.

J: Why don't we go out for dinner after this is all over, eh?

Morridow: Do your job and I might just think about it.

Morridow: Here, your iced coffee.

J: Thanks. Hm, not bad.

Morridow: Hope that woke you up. Alright, let's get to the rendezvous point.

J: Where are the others?

Morridow points toward the end of the road. Ange and Hopps are having a conversation on the sidewalk while Task Force DEFY are standing guard around them.

Situated ahead of the group is a wall that seems to extend endlessly over the horizon.

J gets out of his sedan and follows Morridow to join Ange's company.

J: ...Ahem, Guten Morgen~

Angelia: You were a good five minutes late.

Angelia: I thought you weren't coming after all.

J: Nonsense. The operation wouldn't go smoothly without me.

J: But if I remember correctly, didn't you say you were going at it alone this time?

Angelia: That was the plan, but the moment I left the building, these two have been stuck to my ass.

Hopps: Frau Angelia, please do not try to leave the safe house using unconventional methods.

Hopps: We are under Chairwoman Ulrich's strictest orders to ensure your personal safety. Do not make our job any more difficult than it already is.

Morridow: Ahaha...

Morridow: Hear, hear. The chairwoman would have my head if you'd managed to shake us off.

Morridow: Besides, my assistance is essential when it comes to coordinating multiple departments.

Angelia: Well, you heard them.

J: Fine, very convincing.

J: So are you guys fully prepared?

Angelia: It's just a simple capture mission. Are you certain this Powell is still inside the Bremen Refugee Settlement?

J: I accessed the security records here.

J: There was records of him entering the settlement yesterday but no records of him exiting. If nothing goes wrong, he should still be inside.

J: However, this man never uses a communicator and often changes the time and location for his meetings.

J: It'll not be easy to find him in such a huge settlement.

Angelia: As long as he is still within the wall, we'll definitely find him.

Angelia: All clues from both Paradeus and other sources point towards this man.

Angelia: But please tell me there's no chance he could leave the settlement through some kind of secret passage.

J: The concrete wall around the settlement goes five meters beneath the ground. The garrison would've noticed anyone who'd dig a tunnel that deep.

Angelia: I hope you're right.

Angelia: So how do we get in?

J: We've already contacted them and made all the necessary arrangements, including securing permits for the Doll ladies.

Morridow: Oh... Actually, I had a hunch that you would want to enter the settlement, so I've also made preparations.

Angelia: Are the permits so important?

Morridow: These are more than permits; they're also identifications.

Morridow: If you approach the restricted area outside the wall without one, those gun fixtures up there will take you for an outlaw and shoot you full of holes.

Angelia: You Germans are real friendly to refugees.

Morridow: Well...it's necessary for maintaining order.

Morridow: With these permits, the soldiers in there won't give us a hard time, and the refugees won't dare lift a hand against us either.

Morridow: It's a lot safer to carry them.

J: Speaking of safety...

J: Considering the location, this investigation will be considerably riskier than your previous ones.

J: Frau Morridow, I think it'd be better if you wait outside.

Morridow: Huh?

Morridow: That...that won't do!

Morridow: I told you - Chairwoman Ulrich wants me to accompany Frau Ange at all times!

Angelia: Actually, I agree with J.

Angelia: We've only been making visits so far. We've had accidents, but they were still relatively harmless.

Angelia: But it's going to be a capture mission this time, and the risk factors of operating in a refugee camp are very high to begin with.

Angelia: There's a high chance there will be a firefight. We can't take you unless you can at least defend yourself.

Angelia: Do you know how to fire a gun?

Morridow: N-Not really...

Morridow: But the refugee relief organization is funded by the government; I have a few contacts in there!

Morridow: We'll need information to locate this man called Powell.

Morridow: As a government official, it's a lot easier for me to talk to the refugees and get information from them.

Morridow: Otherwise, everyone would want to run the other way if they saw a bunch of scary-looking strangers.

Morridow: Besides, we have an agent from the Stasi with us this time, so there's no reason to worry about me, right, J?

J: Since you have such faith in me...

J: Always at your service, my lady~

Angelia: We won't be dealing with anyone from the refugee relief organization as we can't be sure there are no GIP spies among them.

Angelia: But if you know what you're getting yourself into, then be my guest.

Morridow: Okay, I'll make myself useful!

Ange waves her off and makes her way over to the DEFY Dolls.

Angelia: Girls, all prepped and ready to go?

AK-15: Yes.

RPK-16: Things never go according to plan, do they?

RPK-16: What do you think, Antje?

AN-94: I trust Lucia...

AK-12: Our plans always unravel because of the Dolls that are rolled out after us. Who's going to be the one that messes up, I wonder?

Angelia: Enough. I know you're itching to move.

AK-12: But are you sure this is a good idea?

AK-12: Waltzing into the refugee settlement without any backup?

AK-12: Such slipshod plans aren't your style at all.

Angelia: All our leads got cut off. If we don't start taking a more aggressive approach, we'll have come all this way for nothing but a long-distance vacation.

RPK-16: It's quite ingenious though, isn't it?

RPK-16: The most stupid prey can be lured by the most obvious bait.

RPK-16: It works all the time.

RPK-16: According to ancient philosophy in the Far East, some fish do willingly rise to a fisherman's hook even if there's no bait.

AK-12: Well, let's just hope this won't be the day when the trick doesn't work.

Angelia: We'll only worry about that when it really becomes a problem.

Angelia: Before that, we must get ourselves out of this impasse.

Ange returns to her German associates with Task Force DEFY in tow.

Angelia: Alright, everyone's here.

Angelia: Quick briefing.

Angelia: Our objective is to find the man in charge of delivering orphans in this refugee settlement. He goes by the name "Powell" here.

Angelia: Since he's active in three different zones, we have to intercept him before his next delivery.

Angelia: According to the evidence we have gathered so far, the GIP is currently trafficking children for Paradeus.

Angelia: This man is very likely a liaison and enforcer of the GIP-Paradeus partnership.

Angelia: I need information from him, so he must be captured alive.

J: Oh, there's something I'd like to add.

J: I have personally witnessed what you ladies are capable of, but it's very important to let sleeping dogs lie. Do not make a scene that will attract any attention.

J: It was undoubtedly the GIP that ultimately pushed the housemother to take her own life. If word gets out that we're going after their contact, they might decide to just go ahead and kill him.

J: Also, I followed Ange's instruction and didn't tell any of my colleagues about coming here today to prevent this operation from being leaked. I assume you haven't told anyone either?

Morridow: Frau Ange said only Hopps and I are allowed to come with her. I did guess that we're coming to the refugee settlement, but no, I didn't tell a single soul.

Morridow: Neither did you, Herr Hopps, right?

Hopps: I alone will suffice for the task of protecting Frau Angelia.

J: Then I suppose everyone gets the message.

J: If anything does go wrong, we're really on our own.

Angelia: We'll split up once we're in. Keep a low profile.

Hopps: I'm afraid I'll have to object.

Angelia: Why?

Hopps: If we are all scattered, I cannot guarantee your personal safety.

Hopps: I would never have agreed to this plan had I known you were planning to enter the refugee settlement.

Angelia: I don't need your permission.

Angelia: I doubt you could stop me now even if you want to.

Hopps: I know, that's why I will actively participate in your capture mission. However, I hope you won't take this operation lightly and let down your guard.

Hopps: The refugee settlement is isolated from the rest of the city with a wall and turrets because this place is teeming with criminals of the most nefarious kind.

Hopps: The garrison can only prevent the refugees from stepping foot outside, but maintaining order within the settlement is completely beyond their capability.

Angelia: You seem awfully prejudiced against these refugees.

Hopps: I'm just preparing for the worst.

Hopps: If we end up in a large-scale conflict, it's questionable whether our corpses will ever be found.

Angelia: Is that so? In that case, please keep an eye on Miss Morridow over there once we're inside.

Angelia: She's shaking like a leaf.

Morridow: I...I...I'm not...

Angelia: Still, your warning is duly noted. I will only have my Dolls work separately.

Angelia: But everyone else must obey my command. If you can't do that, now is the time to turn back.

Hopps: ...

Hopps: I will obey.

Angelia: No more questions? Then let's go.
Part 2: Spiderweb

2

Hint: For the sake of continuity, please read this excerpt after you have completed "Delta Attack - Beginning".

...

After a brief conversation with Morridow, the military officer at the checkpoint heads inside the sentry box to make a phone call, all the while observing Ange and co.

The mechanical gate of the refugee settlement soon starts rising slowly.

When the gate is fully open, the speakers inside the wall, which have been silent for a long time, start playing music.

Broadcast: Welcome to the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen! We wish you a pleasant journey!

Angelia: Do they expect us to visit the refugee settlement as tourists?

J: I don't think the PA system has made a peep ever since the wall was built.

Morridow: This is the main gate that leads directly to the city. It's practically impossible for refugees to be granted passage, so this gate has pretty much never been opened.

Morridow: There are very strong objections to integrating refugees into our population. It will take a lot of lengthy discussions for the Volkskammer to reach a consensus, and the issue won't be solved until then.

Hopps: It isn't our issue to solve.

Angelia: So this is why the settlement has degenerated into lawlessness.

Angelia: Lucia.

AK-12: Yes, Ange.

Angelia: Take your team and scout this area quickly. I'm going to make some human friends and see what we're dealing with here.

AK-12: Understood.

The streets look clean enough, but they are lined with dilapidated brick apartment blocks and wooden houses, most of which predate WWIII.

Angelia: It looks pretty bleak.

Morridow: Not many venture out during the day.

Morridow: Most of the residents are unemployed, and there aren't any shops or other entertainment facilities for them to go to.

Morridow: Regular refugees only tend to head outside to collect rations distributed by the government.

Angelia: That makes for a very convenient place for crooks and hustlers to get around.

Angelia: Powell has picked a great place for his business.

Morridow: PECMAR has organized fundraising events and contributed a lot to the reconstruction of the settlement.

Morridow: At least it is now reasonably habitable.

Morridow: This used to be a wasteland with nothing apart from ruins, dirt, and weeds.

Angelia: Really...?

Angelia: That's all well and good, but the way I see it, this is essentially no different than a ghetto.

Morridow: Well, it's a long and gradual process...

Angelia: Long and gradual, eh?

Angelia: You see those people who are avoiding our eyes? Their complexion suggests that they're infected with ELID.

Morridow: Hm...

Ange picks a hand-rolled cigarette butt off the ground and gives it a sniff.

Angelia: Also, they're on drugs.

Morridow: Drugs?

J: Painkillers, psychedelics - drugs that cannot cure their sickness but give them a false sense of comfort.

Ange lowers the cigarette butt and looks around.

A few gaunt and emaciated refugees are glaring at them with malice.

Ange returns their gaze squarely. The group mutter under their breath and retreat deeper into an alley.

Hopps: Why are we stopping?

Angelia: This settlement seems even more dangerous than I expected.

Angelia: Ange flicks the cigarette butt away and cleans her fingers with her handkerchief.

Hopps: Humph, it's just drugs.

Hopps: Hardly surprising in a piss-hole like this.

J: ...Hopps, you sound like a conservative?

Hopps: ...I'm not particularly political.

Hopps: What, you can't put me under investigation just because I'm telling the truth.

J: I wasn't questioning you. The Stasi also takes the refugee issue very seriously. It's natural for people who have lost hope of salvation to turn to other things.

Angelia: I suppose no one's offering any treatment for these people?

Morridow: The Bremen government is very eager to establish a comprehensive healthcare system and provide the required facility and equipment for the refugees.

Morridow: Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to obtain medical resources outside the White Zone. There is only limited healthcare services even for German citizens.

Morridow: Not to mention the shortage of medical staff.

Morridow: That's why the only thing the government can do for the settlement is to support the efforts of the local refugee relief organizations and give them what little medical supplies we can spare.

Hopps: Even so, the government shouldn't be wasting our tax revenue on places like this.

Angelia: Is that why your superiors have decided to leave these people here to die?

Morridow: It can't be helped...

Morridow: PECMAR has been trying to push a bill to solve the refugee issue, but nobody wants to invest the necessary resources.

Morridow: Before we can secure healthcare and basic welfare for the refugees, a strict quarantine is the best measure we can take at the moment.

Morridow: We can't let the ELID epidemic spread into the city...

Morridow: Even uninfected refugees would require sufficient education and training to integrate into society.

Morridow: In our current situation, we simply do not have the funding or the human resources for that.

Angelia: This settlement is pretty much a microcosm of what's happening in the world.

AN-94: Ange, we're onto something.

Angelia: Go on.

AN-94: We've scanned the relevant areas and detected a target that appears to be Powell.

AN-94: Our analysis on his facial features and gait gives us reason to believe that this is the high-value target we are looking for.

AN-94: The HVT is currently heading towards the Refugee Support Center, which is his rendezvous point according to our intel.

Angelia: Understood. We're coming your way. Tail him from a safe distance. Don't get spotted.

AK-12: We are fairly far away from the HVT.

AK-12: But the refugees nearby are starting to congregate and they don't look too friendly.

Angelia: Stay low... This is just a refugee settlement, but the GIP must have people in here. I'm sure they've already heard of what happened yesterday.

AK-12: You mean they're waiting for us to come?

Angelia: That's exactly what I want.

Angelia: Give me visuals on the target. I need to confirm it.

AN-94: Hold on... You are now synced to my vision.

—Connection established.

An overweight man peers left and right before entering a small alley. He knocks on a door, which opens to let him in, and he disappears from sight.

Farther down the alley, a group of young refugees are beating up a middle-aged man. A ration can rolls out of the paper bag that he is desperately trying to protect. He reaches for the can but one of his attackers pins a foot firmly on his hand.

AN-94: We've lost sight of the HVT, but that man over there...

Angelia: We're not here to do the police's job.

AK-12: We know better than to get sidetracked. It just doesn't sit right with Antje.

AK-12: Renate, can you see the target from your location?

AK-12: He's in our blind spot.

RPK-16: We have our eyes firmly on him.

RPK-16: Ah, it's absolutely delightful to see him so flustered.

AK-12: Enjoy the view.

AK-12: Antje, we're switching locations.

AN-94: Roger.

Angelia: Lucia and the others have spotted Powell. He is on his way to the Refugee Support Center.

J: That was quick!

J: Our recon people could really take a page out of the Doll ladies' book.

Hopps: Ready your weapons. The GIP may show themselves.

Hopps: They will not be giving us a warm welcome.

Angelia: No, they're already here.

Following Ange's gaze, her associates notice a group of people heading their way. They appear as physically unkempt as the other refugees, but they hold themselves in a completely different way.

Angelia: These people mean business.

Hopps: Unfriendly business.

Angelia: Keep moving and maintain a safe distance.

Morridow: Huh?!

Morridow: Who are they?

Morridow: What do they want?

J: They don't look like local gangsters. Their tailing method reminds me more of plainclothes.

J: In any case, they're definitely not here to welcome us, though I certainly didn't expect an attack so soon.

Angelia: Aren't they your friends?

J: My friends?

J: I have no such friends. The Stasi and the Polizei don't really see eye to eye.

J: But one thing's for sure⁠—I'm the only one the Stasi sent.

Hopps: There are many who have a stake in the refugee settlement. We are being watched by multiple factions.

Hopps: Someone might have decided to intervene to protect their own interests.

Angelia: Humph... Interests...

Angelia: Lucia, we're being stalked. Track them down.

AK-12: Piece of cake. Their disguise is pretty flimsy.

AK-12: What should we do with them? Do we engage?

Angelia: I don't want to cause a commotion if I can help it, but I don't think they really care.

AK-12: Judging by the way they're moving, they're definitely armed.

Angelia: We can't afford to be bogged down here.

Angelia: Renate, keep pursuing the HVT. Antje, get to a rooftop and watch the surroundings.

Angelia: Lucia, go and help out that poor fellow.

AK-12: Ha... Another good deed of the day?

Angelia: Yep, we are the good guys, after all.

By the time Ange gets off the comms, their pursuers have already closed the distance between them.

Both J and Hopps move their hands toward their concealed weapons and look at Ange for instructions.

J: What's the plan?

Angelia: We split up at the alley up ahead to scatter them. DEFY will then pick them off.

Angelia: Morridow, we're going this way.

Morridow: Huh? Do we really have to split up?

J: What a shame. Guess I'll team up with the big burly man then.

Hopps: ...

Ange puts her arm around Morridow and guides her down a small path while J and Hopps turn the other way and enter a different alley.

The "refugees" follow suit. They stop at the junction uncertainly. After a brief discussion, they also break into two teams.

Ange glances in J and Hopp's direction. As she expected, some of their pursuers have splintered off to follow them.

Only three are still on Ange and Morridow's trail; they probably think the women would be easy pickings.

AK-12: I'm in position.

Angelia: Make it clean.

AK-12: There are only three of them. Don't insult me.

With Morridow in tow, Ange suddenly darts into the alley. She picks up a piece of brick from the ground when she's temporarily out of the enemies' sight.

At the end of the alley, the group of young refugees have already seized the middle-aged man's paper bag. Ange watches as they take pleasure in tormenting their victim, who is curled up on the ground.

Angelia: Ten seconds.

AK-12: Copy that.

Morridow: What...what are you planning to do?

Angelia: ...Hush.

Angelia: Stay close.

With brick in hand, Ange starts walking towards the group of thugs.

Completely engrossed in pulverizing their victim, the young men remain oblivious to Ange's advance. She raises the piece of brick and bashes it hard into one of the thugs' skull.

The thug lets out a cry and collapses. The others immediately straighten up and turn around to confront the attacker.

Meanwhile, Ange has already dragged Morridow out of their sight. All they see are the "refugees" who have come running this way upon hearing that yelp of pain.

These "refugees" have no idea what has transpired mere seconds ago, but when the young men come charging at them with knives unsheathed, they realize they're in danger and immediately draw their pistols.

The thugs freeze at the sight of the firearms, while the "refugees" also hesitate bemusedly at the sudden turn of events.

Before the "refugees" can figure out the situation, AK-12 suddenly leaps down from the rooftop and lands behind the last man in the file. Using her momentum, she jabs him in the back of the neck.

The man crumples to the ground in a heap. His two associates realize immediately that this is a trap, but just as they are about to turn around, AK-12 punches one of them squarely in the jaw.

The other tries to take aim at her, so she grabs the man with the recently-broken jaw by the arm and flings him into the one still with the pistol. As he loses his balance, AK-12 strikes him in the wrist. His grip loosens out of pain and the pistol falls onto the ground with a clatter.

Finally, she gives him a shove, giving her the space to execute a roundhouse kick, which sends the last "refugee" and his friends all hurtling into the back alley bins, rendering them unconscious.

AK-12: Voilà.

Morridow: That was insanely fast!

Angelia: Check their stuff.

AK-12 nods and starts rummaging through their pockets.

Ange picks up their weapons and removes the magazines, then she dismantles the pistols and tosses the parts into the bins.

She shoves the loaded magazines into Morridow's bag, while the latter is still in a daze.

Everything happened too quickly. The thugs, knives still in hand, are still trying to wrap their heads around what just happened.

AK-12 simply shoots them a glance. They immediately give a start and scramble away in fright.

The middle-aged man huddling on the ground once again hears footsteps approaching. He looks up and sees a woman dressed in a black suit place a ration can that has rolled off right in front of him.

Without any word of gratitude, the shell-shocked man grabs the can and takes off running.

...

...Residence of Chairwoman Ulrich, Bremen.

Ulrich: I'm afraid I don't understand, Herr Bürgermeister. Are you saying I'm to undergo individual interrogation?

Mayor of Bremen: It's not as serious as it sounds, Frau Ulrich.

Mayor of Bremen: It's just a standard procedure. After all, everyone is watching the "Good Samaritan" of Bremen with keen interest, and it was you who facilitated her entry into the city.

Mayor of Bremen: I'm sure that many others are wondering where your loyalties lie.

Ulrich: What exactly is that supposed to mean? I am absolutely loyal to my country, my party, as well as my people.

Ulrich: Those words didn't come from you. Who is it that's questioning my loyalties? The city of Bremen? The Volkskammer? The Socialist Unity Party? Or is it someone in Pankow?

Ulrich: If the party suspects treachery on my part, I demand that they immediately remove me from office and hand me over to the Ministry for State Security for investigation.

Ulrich: Herr Erich Meyer, Vice-Chief of the Stasi, happens to be the one who put me on this case to begin with. You could ask him to take me away.

Mayor of Bremen: No, no, that's not what I mean.

Mayor of Bremen: There is no need to trouble Herr Meyer over such a trivial matter. It really is not as serious as you think.

Ulrich: Then please explain yourself.

Mayor of Bremen: The Pan-European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Reconstruction has been extremely generous in your aid of our government, we know that.

Mayor of Bremen: However, when running a city, it is essential to adhere to its actual jurisdictional administration. It isn't wise to overstep one's authority.

Ulrich: Of course. I will make sure my subordinate exercises restraint in her actions.

Mayor of Bremen: Will you?

Mayor of Bremen: But from what I know, the "Good Samaritan" has already made her way into the refugee settlement, isn't that right?

Ulrich: And? Does that inconvenience you in any way?

Mayor of Bremen: Hm, it is not my intention to bypass you or the Stasi to interfere with your friend's business.

Mayor of Bremen: To be honest, a number of long-standing problems have been solved beautifully with her help.

Mayor of Bremen: However, unlike the few storms she's kicked up before, meddling with the refugee settlement is a lot more problematic.

Ulrich: I do not understand. Does the Bremen government have some kind of secret in there?

Mayor of Bremen: I'll give it to you straight.

Mayor of Bremen: Nobody wants to have anything to do with that place, but nobody wants something bad to happen there either.

Mayor of Bremen: I know you are Rossartrists, but you can't be so idealistic about everything.

Mayor of Bremen: That settlement is like a pustule, Frau Ulrich. I hope you will refrain from popping it and splashing dirty pus everywhere.

Mayor of Bremen: Especially when we all desperately need to keep up appearances.

Ulrich: A pustule? That's a bit of an understatement from what I know...

Mayor of Bremen: No, you have no idea what you're dealing with. It's a lot worse than any of us can imagine.

Mayor of Bremen: No matter how many resources PECMAR pours into the settlement, that place is a bottomless pit that can never be filled.

Mayor of Bremen: You will never understand the difficulties faced by those who are doing the actual work. We are responsible for a lot more people than the refugees in there. Everything costs money these days.

Mayor of Bremen: It's simply impossible to achieve the results you desire with finite resources.

Mayor of Bremen: It's hard enough to preserve the status quo within the settlement.

Mayor of Bremen: It takes a certain amount of self-governance to keep that place from falling apart, and there just so happens to be someone who's providing said "governance", in a manner of speaking.

Mayor of Bremen: I know their methods are underhanded, and the government certainly wishes someone of less dubious nature could do the job, but they're a necessary evil.

Ulrich: So you're asking that the Soviets refrain from crossing a certain line and causing all hell to break loose in the settlement?

Mayor of Bremen: We are both civilized people. We both know how certain things need to be handled.

Mayor of Bremen: I deeply appreciate the contributions your friends have made to the development of Bremen. I'm sure their presence will drive the city to a better future.

Mayor of Bremen: But I've also heard some rumors that if something comes to pass, the pledge that Bremen has made to Berlin will be undermined.

Mayor of Bremen: This concerns the unity of our nation and could threaten to shatter the hard-earned trust in the post-war era.

Mayor of Bremen: As you've said yourself, people in Pankow would be greatly displeased.

Ulrich: ...

Ulrich: You're absolutely right, we need to trust each other now more than ever in the aftermath of the war. I completely understand your concern.

Ulrich: Protecting our country's interests is our common goal, so I will do whatever I can for this noble cause.

Mayor of Bremen: Thank you for everything you have done for Bremen and for our country.

...

Morridow: The mayor actually said that?

Ulrich: Morridow, what's the situation over there?

Morridow: We just entered the refugee camp. Things have been going well so far...

Ulrich: Hm, I trust Ange will have no problem keeping things under control.

Ulrich: Your presence should also help stabilize the situation, but right now, we can't be certain of anything.

Ulrich: If the settlement erupts into chaos, make your safety the priority.

Morridow: ...Understood, Frau Ulrich.

Morridow: Frau Ange is a real pro. She's been neutralizing all kinds of threats very skillfully throughout her investigations.

Morridow: However, she is hellbent on capturing the child trafficker in the settlement. No matter how cautious we try to be, I'm afraid a commotion is inevitable.

Ulrich: You've been working by my side for too long. We only ever see the good side of things—the deceptive façade—because we have little to no real-world experience.

Ulrich: I didn't tell you about the conversation I had with the mayor to put a stop to your operation. I just want you to know that the path to even the slightest bit of progress is always long and winding, and sometimes, the price for progress is far beyond what you can imagine.

Ulrich: Our goal is to build a world of peace. Before we have peace, we must experience the cruelty of war.

Morridow: Yes, Frau Ulrich, I will do my utmost best.

Ulrich: Whatever the outcome of this capture operation, tell Ange to get in touch with me once you leave the settlement.

Ulrich: There are certain matters that we can attend to only after this is over.

...

Angelia: How are things on your end?

Hopps: We're done.

Hopps: These folks weren't half bad. They've had formal training.

J: Pretty much on the same level as professional soldiers. Nothing we can't handle though.

Angelia: We have no time to waste on these people. We must hurry and find Powell.

AK-12: Ange, take a look at this.

Lucia hands Ange an ID she has found while searching the "refugees". It bears the insignia of the Mobile Einsatzkommando.

Morridow: Police from the MEK?

Morridow: So it wasn't the GIP?

Morridow: Then why were they following us?

Angelia: IDs can be falsified, but this insignia is the real deal.

Angelia: Also, just because they're police doesn't mean they don't work for the GIP.

Angelia: Looks like corruption runs a lot deeper in the local public service than we first imagined.

J: Save me your schadenfreude. This is exactly why we're needed for the job.

AN-94: Ange, enemy reinforcements are heading this way.

Angelia: Got it. We're getting out of here.

A group of people rush toward the alley. Ange pulls Morridow further down the passageway.

AK-12 turns into another alley and disappears.

Their new pursuers stop to examine the unconscious MEK officers and report their findings through the comms while cautiously keeping an eye on their surroundings.

In the end, probably intimidated by their enemies' strength, they decide to give up the chase and withdraw with their unconscious colleagues.

AK-12: The cops have left the alley.

Angelia: They gave up then. Smart choice.

Angelia: Alright. Renate, sit rep.

RPK-16: The HVT has entered the Refugee Support Center indicated on our map. It looks like a church.

RPK-16: I'm detecting multiple human bio signs on the second floor. He's not alone.

Angelia: Seal off the back door. Don't let them escape.

Angelia: J, Hopps, do you copy?

J: What do you need?

Angelia: The HVT's location has been confirmed. He's in the Refugee Support Center. You two approach from the southeast and I'll enter the church from the northwest. DEFY will cut them off.

Angelia: Don't give yourselves away. We need this guy alive.

J: I can handle that, but make sure you don't beat him to death, big oaf.

Hopps: I will capture this man myself.

Angelia: Lucia, watch the front entrance. Don't let anyone out.

AK-12: Are you sure about this?

AK-12: The capture will likely go better if you leave that to us.

Angelia: You need to secure the perimeter of the church. Compared to Powell, I'm more worried about the cops of questionable allegiance.

AK-12: Understood.

AK-12: We've lost our stalkers, but the refugees nearby have started gathering this way. This doesn't look entirely natural.

Angelia: Aide summoned by the HVT?

AK-12: I'm not sure. They aren't displaying any hostile behavior, but they could be tipping others off about our location.

AK-12: We will try our best to avoid getting spotted as we relocate to a new observation point.

Angelia: Copy that.

Ange drags Morridow along as they dart through alleys and passageways. She can clearly tell that there are more refugees out and about than before.

These people eye the two women quizzically and expectantly.

Angelia: Why are there more and more of them...?

Morridow: It's almost noon. The Refugee Support Center usually gives out food around this time, so the refugees are coming this way.

Angelia: What?

Angelia: Why didn't you tell me something so important?

Morridow: Huh? Is it important?

Morridow: ...You didn't ask.

Angelia: It's not a good idea to snatch someone in broad daylight...

Hopps: Ange, we're to the southeast of the church. Where are you?

Angelia: We're almost in position as well. Stand by where you are.

Ange and Morridow exit the alley and the church that's being used as the Refugee Support Center comes into view.

There aren't that many wandering refugees here, but the two women stick out too much because of their appearance.

Ange was going to leave Morridow outside, but she changes her mind and decides to bring her along.

Angelia: Are you familiar with this building?

Morridow: I...I've been here a few times.

Angelia: Describe its interior.

Morridow: It's a regular lobby on the first floor, converted from the chapel.

Morridow: All the pews have been taken apart for firewood.

Morridow: There are two staircases that lead to the second floor. The office is in the back.

Angelia: Are there any other exits?

Morridow: I think there's a ladder that leads to the cellar, but I don't know where it is...

Angelia: Good. All this information will make the capture much easier.

Morridow: Why are you putting your own life at risk to do this?

Morridow: You have your Doll bodyguards... Isn't it better to let them handle this?

Angelia: They have an even more important job. A good commander should never shove all the dangerous work onto Dolls.

Angelia: Also...don't you trust me?

Morridow: Oh... That's not what I mean.

Angelia: In that case, leave this to me.

Angelia: Don't make a peep and just stay close to me, okay?

Morridow nods uncertainly.

Ange pulls out her pistol and vaults through the window quietly into the building with Morridow.

Angelia: We're in. There are two staircases with access to the second floor. You two take over the one on the other side.

Angelia: I will capture the HVT when the timing is right.

Hopps: None of us knows what's waiting for us in there.

Hopps: Frau Ulrich reminded me once again after learning what happened before that we mustn't let you put yourself in too much danger.

Hopps: Let me take the lead.

Angelia: No, I want to catch that bastard myself.

Angelia: Take control of the staircase on the other end. That's an order.

Hopps: ...Roger.

Ange creeps toward the bottom of the stairs. She gestures for Morridow to remain where she is and starts ascending cautiously.

The thick floorboards creak softy under her slow footsteps. As she gets closer to the second floor, she can clearly overhear someone having a conversation.

...

Male Voice: ...Is my contact still not here?

Male Voice: I'm already being followed!

Male Voice: This isn't what we agreed on!

Ange quietly leans against the wall. Peeking around the corner, she can see the fat man talking on the phone. Four men armed with submachine guns are guarding him.

The high-value target is right in front of Ange, but she patiently waits for the armed guards to turn their backs.

Powell: You lot, watch this place! We're on our own!

Powell: I'm going to find a few genuine friends that can help us!

The men turn towards Powell—here comes her chance!

Just then—

Male Voice: Who's there?!!

All of a sudden, a shout comes from the other end of the corridor, followed by the sound of submachine guns and pistols exchanging fire.

Powell: They...they're here!!

Angelia: Dammit!

The men in the room come charging out. Ange takes out the one in the lead with a clean shot before diving around the corner back to the stairs.

A bullet whizzes past where she was standing a second ago.

The enemies fire continuously at the corner until Ange hears the telltale clicks.

These men have clearly not undergone professional training. They kept strafing aimlessly and emptied their magazines in an instant.

While they are busy fumbling with their new magazines, trying to reload, Ange ducks around the corner and guns down two of them.

Meanwhile, a shot is also fired on the other end, and the last armed enemy is taken out by the man who just made it onto the second floor.

Angelia: Hold your fire! It's me!

Hopps: Where's Powell?

Angelia: He escaped through the cellar. What happened downstairs?!

J: Someone suddenly came up from behind us. He had a gun.

J: We had no choice but to strike first...

Hopps: ...Sorry.

Angelia: Behind you? What rotten luck.

Angelia: J, check the whole room. Make it quick.

J: It's empty. Do we go down the ladder and maintain pursuit?

Angelia: No, unless you want to die.

J: Fine, forget I asked.

AK-12: Watch out, Ange. The refugees outside heard the gunshots and are gathering outside the church.

AK-12: They have the building completely surrounded. I suggest you stay put inside.

Angelia: Crap...

Angelia: Hopps, get Morridow up here.

Angelia: Then lock all the doors and windows.

Hopps: On it.

Hopps: Some refugees tried to break into the lobby. I scared them off with my gun.

Angelia: Make sure no one gets in.

Angelia: If they charge in as a group, we can't hold them off with our armament.

Hopps: I'll do my best.

AK-12: Do you have the HVT?

Angelia: No, the capture failed. The target escaped through the cellar.

Angelia: Renate, can you spot the HVT?

RPK-16: Ange messed up. How unusual.

Angelia: Answer me!

RPK-16: I'll try to find him, but the refugees around us are getting uncomfortably close.

RPK-16: Permission to intimidate them with our weapons?

Angelia: Permission granted, but don't fire unless you absolutely have to.

RPK-16: We will respond in an appropriately friendly manner.

RPK-16: Still, the refugees around the church are getting rowdy. They seem very angry about the lack of rations today.

RPK-16: If they get their hands on you, they'll probably make a delicious lunch out of you.

Angelia: Thanks for the warning. Capture the HVT and bring him to the church.

Angelia: I will hunker down here with these bumbling dunces. This will also be our extraction point.

Angelia: Take Erwin with you. Lucia and Antje, keep the situation outside under control.

AK-12: Copy that.

RPK-16: Didn't you just give a grand speech about not exploiting Dolls? Now you're leaving the nastiest job to us.

Angelia: Oh please, I know you enjoy it.

RPK-16: By the way, Powell just has to be alive when I bring him to you, right?

Angelia: I have no complaints as long as he can speak. Otherwise, do as you please.

RPK-16: Hahaha... I was hoping you'd say that.

Angelia: J, what have you found?

J: Powell's ledger, contact list, and memo pad.

J: I'm sure these will help us dig up a bunch of people.

J: Hard to believe he has all this important evidence just lying around in the room.

Angelia: He probably didn't expect anyone to take down his meat shields and gatecrash his den.

J: True, bulldozers like you aren't too common...

J: You really are made of sterner stuff to have made it out alive of that submarine base.

J: Don't look at me like that, the entire Stasi knows about your daring escapade with K.

RPK-16: Ange, we've once again located the HVT.

RPK-16: He has emerged in the residential area and is moving south.

RPK-16: He is taking cover among a group of refugees, and the ones around us are getting restless.

RPK-16: I don't think they want us to be snooping around.

RPK-16: Erwin, give them a glimpse of your combat knife.

RPK-16: ...

RPK-16: Okay, they now have no problem with our snooping around.

RPK-16: But we'd better be on our way. Lucia, do you have visuals on the HVT's location?

AK-12: One moment, establishing visual link.

AK-12: Right, that's him. We'll keep observing the HVT. You now have his real-time coordinates.

AK-12: You'd better hurry. I have a feeling that things are going to get worse the longer this drags on.

RPK-16: Understood. Finally, we can take credit for a capture.

RPK-16: It was always you who got all the glory. Erwin isn't too pleased about that.

AK-12: You mean YOU are not too pleased about that. As if Erwin would care about this kind of thing.

Hopps: Ange, can your Doll squad come and give us some support?

Angelia: I've left two nearby outside the church; the other pair are pursuing Powell.

Angelia: He's heading south and the refugees are covering his escape.

J: I thought Powell was an undesirable figure here, but the opposite seems to be true?

Hopps: He must be pretty influential among the locals to be able to buy off the police.

Hopps: If the refugees are also doing his bidding, it's too dangerous to move here.

Hopps: We'd better get some reinforcements.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: Agreed.

Angelia: J, we need a helicopter.

Angelia: Once DEFY has the HVT, they'll retreat to this location. Then we'll take our cargo up to the roof and get out of here.

J: Now? I'll have to run this past my superior.

Angelia: You can't even authorize a chopper lift?

Morridow: Let me contact the chairwoman!

Morridow: PECMAR's aircrafts have airspace clearance. They are ready to fly anytime!

J: My rank and authority aren't the issue here. Unlike you Soviets, our state security department doesn't have its own military force.

J: It's difficult to arrange for such things without prior preparation.

Angelia: Tsk... I'm starting to miss the pal who can randomly send me a helicopter with 25 T-Dolls.

J: We are in the heart of a well-populated city. Please don't turn this place into a second Belgrade... K said he'll bring backup ASAP.

Angelia: Fine. Let's hope he'll be on time for once. We must hold this church until DEFY completes the capture.

Angelia: If the refugees manage to get through, none of us will live to see the sun rise tomorrow.
Part 4: Animal Chess

Hint: For the sake of continuity, please read this excerpt after you have completed "Delta Attack - Beginning".

...

RPK-16: That was really interesting, wasn't it?

...Zone A, Refugee Settlement.

AK-15: What?

RPK-16: The broadcast. And the refugees here. Neither is making us feel very welcome.

The refugees are openly hostile to well-dressed people who obviously don't belong here.

Ever since RPK-16 and AK-15 have entered the residential area, the people here have been giving them dirty looks. Some even spat at them belligerently.

AK-15: They are not armed.

AK-15: Simple acts of provocation driven by extreme animosity are no threat to us.

RPK-16: Humans have a tendency of dividing themselves into different classes and they love finding ways to feel superior.

RPK-16: From a Doll's point of view, this kind of self-deception is quite amusing.

RPK-16: I wonder how they would react if we demonstrate the fact that they are actually inferior?

AK-15: That is not part of the mission.

RPK-16 snatches up a few items of clothing that some refugees have left out to dry as she walks down the street. She hands AK-15 a coat.

RPK-16: We can add to our itinerary, like, right now.

RPK-16: I believe at least two wannabe-hunters want to experience what it feels to be hunted.

AK-15: Are we being followed already?

RPK-16: Yes, but they're not particularly skilled, just like the ones that latched onto Ange when we first arrived.

RPK-16: I was hoping someone would show a bit more finesse, but so far I've only been disappointed.

RPK-16: Isn't that kind of demotivating?

AK-15: You're right, I see them. I've tapped into their comms link. Sharing audio with you.

RPK-16: Looks like there's more than two of them.

RPK-16: Well, it's only polite to bag them all.

AK-15: Ange told us to avoid firing our weapons.

RPK-16: My dear, firing our weapons isn't the only way to eliminate our enemies.

RPK-16: "Elimination" is just the result. What matters is how we define the process.

AK-15: What are you planning to do?

RPK-16 reveals a few black cubes.

RPK-16: Camouflage yourself.

RPK-16: Then let's have some fun "fishing".

...

Armed Agent A: Targets spotted again. They're exiting a house.

Armed Agent A: Squad A is tailing them.

Plainclothes Commander: Copy that. Squad B is right behind you, ready to outflank the two Dolls.

Plainclothes Commander: Note that these are not your run-of-the-mill Tactical Dolls. They've already taken out two of our teams. Exercise extreme caution.

Plainclothes Commander: They have disguised themselves with clothing of local refugees. Observe their physique and don't lose them.

Armed Agent A: Understood. Squad A has stun guns at the ready. We can attack as soon as we come into contact with the targets.

Armed Agent B: Are you sure about using non-lethal weapons?

Armed Agent B: They are a lot more dangerous than we first expected.

Plainclothes Commander: Whoever gets tased by a stun gun is knocked right out, be them human or Doll.

Plainclothes Commander: Besides, these Dolls participated in the operation at that submarine base. The intel in their neural clouds is worth much more than your heads.

Armed Agent A: Don't worry.

Armed Agent A: We've pinpointed their signals. We have the initiative.

Armed Agent B: Alright, we'll pick up the pace and get to the next junction. Then we can launch a pincer attack with Squad A.

Armed Agent B: Humph, they're still pursuing Powell doggedly. They have no idea that the guy is just bait.

Armed Agent A: The targets are moving steadily towards their objective. They haven't caught sight of us.

Armed Agent A: We are now hidden in the crowd. Squad A is 15 meters away from the Dolls.

Armed Agent B: It's only two Dolls.

Armed Agent B: Maintain your current speed. We can proceed once everyone is in position.

Plainclothes Commander: Attention Squad A, the targets have split up.

Plainclothes Commander: They are now moving in opposite directions.

Armed Agent A: Using the same trick again?

Armed Agent A: We're not falling for it this time.

Plainclothes Commander: Something's wrong. One of them is heading towards you!

Armed Agent A: That's perfect. We can do them in ahead of schedule.

Disguised as a refugee, the plainclothes agent hide his stun gun in his coat and watches as a figure wearing a hat saunters toward them, completely oblivious to the hidden threat.

He confirms the signal—it is his target.

The armed agent jabs the stun gun at the person with the hat, who collapses after giving a spasm.

The other two plainclothes agents drags the unconscious victim into the space between two buildings.

Armed Agent A: That was easy. Get the hat off.

Armed Agent A: Even with all those layers on, our stun gun still—

The hat is taken off...only to reveal a middle-aged man who is foaming at the mouth.

Armed Agent A: What...?

RPK-16: Bullying innocent civilians isn't a good habit, Mr. Cop~

Armed Agent A: ...!!

The plainclothes tries to attack RPK-16 with his stun gun, but she grabs him by the wrist and twists his arm around, causing him to stun himself instead. He convulses and hits the ground. His colleagues pauses for a moment, trying to comprehend what just happened, then they all charge at RPK-16.

...

A few plainclothes officers are flung out into the street. RPK-16 pokes her head out and peers left and right before dragging them back into the narrow alley.

Plainclothes Commander: Squad A!

Plainclothes Commander: Squad A, respond!

Armed Agent B: This is Squad B!

Armed Agent B: Something's not right. Our targets just multiplied! There are now four of them!

Armed Agent B: No, eight!

Plainclothes Commander: Scheiße! They've deployed signal decoys!

Plainclothes Commander: They must've slipped signal emitters into the refugees' pockets to throw us off!

Plainclothes Commander: Ignore the signals! Can you spot the Dolls by sight?!

Armed Agent B: Y...Yes, sir!

Armed Agent B: Hold on, they're coming from behind... Draw weapons...!

Armed Agent B: Argh!!

Plainclothes Commander: Squad B? Squad B?!

Plainclothes Commander: ...We've lost contact with two squads in a matter of seconds... Are we actually the ones being hunted?

Plainclothes Commander: If...if that's the case, then they must be monitoring our comms...

The plainclothes commander wipes away the sweat on his forehead. He throws his radio onto the ground and crushes it with a foot.

He is just about to turn and run when someone seizes him by the collar from behind.

RPK-16: As the commander, you're just going to turn tail and leave your subordinates for dead? Isn't that a bit dishonorable?

Beads of sweat start dripping down the man's forehead again. He suddenly draws his pistol and turns around, trying to shoot RPK-16.

Unsurprisingly, RPK-16 grabs his arm and with a nimble twist, the man finds himself flung across the air before crashing heavily onto the ground.

AK-15: I'm done over here. Have you captured their commander?

RPK-16: Snatched him just as he was about to leg it.

Plainclothes Commander: Blasted Doll! Do you know who I am?!

Plainclothes Commander: You mechanical low-lives! What gives you the right to do this?!

RPK-16: Oh dear, quite the bigot, aren't you?

RPK-16: Thankfully, unlike humans, we Dolls are very open-minded and tolerant.

RPK-16: If you tell me who's pulling the strings and what they're planning, I'm happy to pretend I didn't hear what you just said.

Plainclothes Commander: You've got to be joking!

Plainclothes Commander: We're the police! If you dare raise a hand against law enforcers, you won't be leaving Bremen at all!

RPK-16: Hm, it seems our conscientious public servant doesn't quite understand the situation.

RPK-16: Erwin, I'll leave it to you to persuade Fritz over here.

AK-15: This way, please.

AK-15 drags the man by the collar into an abandoned house.

The sound of punches landing on flesh can soon be heard.

The man howls in pain and struggles to break free. He tries to scramble outside, but AK-15 simply seizes him again and hauls him back into the house.

RPK-16: Why do people only want to talk after being subjected to unnecessary pain?

RPK-16: Why can't we just come to an understanding with words alone?

RPK-16: Don't you agree, Fritz?

RPK-16 expresses her dismay theatrically as she strolls in through the door.

Blood is flowing from the man's nose, smearing half of his face. He can barely open his eyes.

Plainclothes Commander: My...my name...isn't Fritz...

RPK-16: Doesn't matter. I don't really care what you're called.

RPK-16: So, can you finally tell us what we want to know?

Plainclothes Commander: I...I...

RPK-16: Still not talking?

RPK-16: Your willpower is truly commendable. Erwin, give him another round.

Plainclothes Police: A-Alright! I'll tell you everything!

Plainclothes Police: Don't beat me anymore!

A few minutes later...

RPK-16: Fascinating. I didn't expect humans to come up with such an interesting plan.

AK-15: Should we inform Ange?

RPK-16: Of course. I also want to tell her about my new idea.

AK-15: Are you sure about that?

AK-15: We will be walking right into their trap.

RPK-16: Imagine if someone thinks they're about to go to Heaven but they suddenly find themselves in Hell—it's going to be so much fun!

RPK-16: As long as we capture the HVT in the end, Ange won't have a problem no matter what we do, right?

RPK-16: In that case, you can't blame me for having some harmless fun while doing a boring task.

AK-15: ...Fine. Do whatever you want.

...Zone A, Refugee Settlement.

In a certain control room, a group of people are working in front of multiple surveillance workstations.

There is a steady stream of electronic pings and keyboard clicks. New documents are constantly being printed, held up against the monitors for comparison and calculations.

With a fresh cup of coffee in hand, the chief inquires about the latest status of the mission.

Station Chief: What happened?

Operator A: They've obscured their signals after attacking our agents. We're trying to locate them.

Station Chief: Can't believe those Soviet scrap metal robots are capable of that... Anything on the surveillance system?

Operator B: We're looking, but the CCTV cameras around the residential area are experiencing signal failures.

Station Chief: Get them back online as fast as you can! They're going to make use of this opportunity to act and we can't afford to be blind!

Station Chief: If we still don't have the Soviet bitch and her toys before Powell gets taken away, it'll be on all our heads!

Operator B: Yes sir...

Operator B: Wait, I think we have them over here!

The triumphant shout has attracted everyone's attention.

The monitor shows two female Dolls on the move, one with short hair and the other of imposing stature.

The smart suits they are wearing make them extremely out of place in the derelict streets and regularly draw the eyes of passing refugees.

Powell went inside this building just minutes ago.

The Dolls in pursuit arrive outside the office of the Refugee Aid Association and look around briefly before also slipping into the building.

Operator B: Their appearance matches the description. These are the Dolls sent by our target from Zone A.

Station Chief: Hahaha, and they think nobody knows what they're up to.

Operator B: We've already notified our people nearby to stand by for orders.

Station Chief: Good. Give them the green light!

...

On the monitor, the armed agents are all in position around the building. At the chief's command, they storm into the office.

Meanwhile, in the control room, everyone is observing the situation through the armed agents' camera feed.

Armed Agent A: First floor clear. No sign of any animate objects.

...

Armed Agent A: We're outside the last room. Preparing to break in...

Boom!

Armed Agent B: Clear.

Armed Agent C: Clear!

Armed Agent A: ...Sir, we haven't found any Dolls or detected any threats. Awaiting further directives. Over.

Station Chief: What?!

Station Chief: Check again! Did they escape through a different exit?

Operator B: I'm not seeing them on any of the security feed around the building... This...this makes no sense at all.

Station Chief: ...

Armed Agent A: This may be a trap. Right now...should...their...

The comms link is breaking up.

Station Chief: Repeat? Hey!

Station Chief: Verdammt... What the hell is going on?!

Operator A: Our comms are being jammed... No, someone else is forcing their way into our channel!

Station Chief: Someone else...?

???: That's right, sorry to intrude~

Station Chief: ...?!

Upon hearing the slightly sarcastic female voice, the chief gestures for everyone to keep quiet and puts the call on speaker. Then he bids his subordinates to start tracing the signal origin.

???: This is our first time touring the refugee settlement, so we don't really know our way around.

???: You guys have been such a great help. You've made things so much easier for us~

Station Chief: I don't know what you're talking about.

???: Huh? I thought you knew about our objective here.

???: How about this? Why don't we swap some information?

Station Chief: Swap information?

???: Tell me whose side you're on and who leaked our plans to you.

???: In return, I'll tell you our next objective.

Station Chief: Do you think I'm stupid?

???: No deal? Such a pity~

Station Chief: (How much longer do you need?)

Operator B: (Another 20 seconds!)

Station Chief: Alright... I'll think about it, but I expect some gesture of goodwill.

???: Goodwill? Sure.

???: How about we have this conversation face-to-face, in an open and friendly manner?

Station Chief: Wha...?

Before he can respond, the closed window is suddenly shattered and the statuesque Doll that was on the CCTV footage comes flying into the control room. The operators who are quick to react immediately draw their weapons and fire at her.

But their attacks seem to have no effect on their target whatsoever, and the operators are soon knocked out cleanly one after the other.

The chief, who is several paces away from the intruder, raises his own weapon to shoot the Doll, but a slender hand suddenly grips his wrist and dislodges the gun with ease.

Station Chief: Ow! How is this possible...?!

RPK-16: Nothing is impossible. It's just a simple matter of planting some fake CCTV footage and working our way to this place.

RPK-16: It's all because you have too much faith in your "machines", don't you think?

The chief tries to break free, but a heavy blow to the back of his skull puts him out like a light and he slumps onto the floor.

RPK-16: Oh dear, I barely used any force, but he passed out just like that?

AK-15: Aren't we supposed to interrogate him?

RPK-16: We're in a hurry.

RPK-16: Their equipment will tell us what we need to know.

RPK-16: Right, since I've decided to take pity on these bastards, get them all out of here.

AK-15 gets to work right away. RPK-16 sits down at one of the stations, plugs herself into the server, and starts scanning.

...A few minutes later.

RPK-16: ...

RPK-16: I see.

AK-15: What did you find?

RPK-16: All the communications logs and records are on Level II. Their firewall might as well be non-existent.

RPK-16: These Fritzes have grown complacent in peacetime and gotten out of practice when it comes to being terrorists.

RPK-16: If they are willing to pay, I'd gladly teach them how to do this properly.

AK-15: Any important intelligence?

RPK-16: Eh, it's all really boring stuff. We'll let Ange sort through this herself.

RPK-16: I've downloaded the entire database.

RPK-16: That's it, time to go.

AK-15: They're quite slow to react.

RPK-16: They're a bunch of amateurs.

RPK-16: Like I said, if they have the cash, I don't mind making an entire course out of this.

A massive explosion echoes throughout the settlement. The building where RPK-16 and AK-15 are in is instantly engulfed in flames.

A figure observes the burning rubble with binoculars from a distance.

Hint: For the sake of continuity, please read this excerpt after you have completed "Delta Attack - Beginning".

...

...

On the rooftop of a building in the refugee settlement, a rat is sniffing around for food in a piece of faded packaging.

The loud noise of the main gate opening sends the rat scurrying. It scuttles along a piece of thick cable into the building.

The cable is connected to a surveillance display, which is currently showing the opened main gate.

...In a house at a hidden location.

The wall is filled with different CCTV live feeds. Ange's group is captured by the camera angled towards the settlement entrance.

Operator A: Our target is here!

Station Chief: Right on time. Our intel is accurate.

Operator B: Those four around her are Dolls, right?

Station Chief: Our informant has confirmed that. They are the main impediment that hinders Pigeon's operation.

Station Chief: Still, we'll just follow the plan and lure them into our trap, step by step.

Operator A: I didn't expect we'd be officially authorized to deploy the local police.

Station Chief: Our comrades are everywhere!

Station Chief: Victory will be ours! Once this is settled, it will be just a matter of time.

Operator A: The target is heading towards the predicted location.

Station Chief: Slowly does it...

Station Chief: Send the agents to test the waters. Let the game of cat-and-mouse begin.

...

Somewhere in the refugee settlement.

A man is putting on a coat with the help of an attendant. When that's done, he starts adjusting his lapel.

The sun shines through the filthy glass window onto his large and fleshy figure.

Attendant: Herr Powell, should we check in with "them"?

Powell: We aren't on such good terms that they would share information with us voluntarily. I'm just a tool that has some use to them for now—I know that very well.

Powell: Besides, the "rats" are here, aren't they? That's all we need to know.

Attendant: Right...

Powell: Have we got everyone?

Attendant: Yes.

Attendant: As per your instructions, they are all trustworthy candidates that we've cultivated.

Attendant: With their numbers, they should be able to contend with the enemies for a short while.

Attendant: But will you be able to convince them?

Powell: What i'm about to tell them is what they're intimately familiar with; what they want to hear the most.

Powell: (Sighs) None of this should have come to pass. I once had so much faith in Germany.

Powell: I was certain that they would let me continue my operations in the refugee settlement as a philanthropist.

Powell: But now everything has changed and no one would stand up for me...

Powell: Now, we're on our own.

Powell clears his throat and walks through the door.

He is now in a spacious indoor space where a large number of refugees have congregated.

These people used to be police officers or firefighters in the neighboring regions. Some are even veterans who were quickly forgotten after the war.

But no matter their identity, they all bear signs of severe silification. Their faces are all contorted with pain and malnourishment, giving them a ghastly appearance.

At the sight of Powell, all conversations cease and the room becomes eerily silent.

Powell: ...

Powell: My friends, they are extending their corrupt grasp into our home.

Powell: They have already built this looming wall to suppress our freedom, and everything has taken a turn for the worse.

Powell: This isn't how the world used to be. Our home is being exploited, ravaged, razed to the ground, and reduced to rubble.

Powell: But we did nothing to deserve this! What crime have the sick and infirmed committed? What about the children who had the misfortune of being born in a fetid garbage dump?

Powell: And yet, here they come, laying siege on us in our direst moment of need, trying to snuff out our last bit of hope.

Powell: Do we bow our heads and pliantly accept the torment that they are inflicting?!

Refugees: NO! NEVER!

Refugees: THIS IS OUR HOME!

Powell: That's right. This is the only home we have left.

Powell: I visited Hannah on North Street this morning and brought her something to eat.

Powell: She was so weak and frail, but with her dying breath, she was still calling out to her child, who was shot dead by the turrets on the wall.

Powell: We all know who is really responsible for murdering this child and his poor mother.

Refugees: DAMN BREMEN!

Refugees: THEY'VE NEVER TREATED US AS HUMANS!

Refugees: BLOOD FOR BLOOD!

Powell: Exactly! Blood for blood!

Powell: They have finally shown their true colors. They are forcing our hand by taking away our most basic right to live.

Powell: We are not to blame; they have brought this upon themselves. Since they don't treat us like people, they should not be surprised if they find themselves dealing with vengeful beasts instead.

Powell: We will no longer submit to their oppression. It is time we let them know that we intend to fight for our lives.

Powell: Smash their hubris and retake our dignity!

The refugees pump their fists and cheer. Their cries resound throughout the chapel in the church, almost breaking through the ceiling and reaching the heavens.

Morridow: What an idiot...

Morridow mutters under her breath as she stares out the window.

Hopps: Pardon?

Morridow: Oh, sorry. I was just kicking myself for what I said on the phone.

Hopps: You mean your call with Chairwoman Ulrich?

Morridow: ...Yes.

Morridow: Maybe I'm being naïve, but is it always impossible to salvage a situation?

Hopps: Your question is very naïve in and of itself.

Morridow: Really?

Morridow: What are your thoughts on the matter?

Hopps: The way I see it, there are three ways of perceiving the world.

Morridow: What do you mean?

Hopps: The first way is through others' description. If people say the world is a good place, we believe that.

Hopps: The second way is through our own personal experience. We discover that there is darkness in the world, darkness that can taint people's souls.

Hopps: The third way...is through things that are inflicted upon us. Pain that we are forced to suffer even if we try to avoid it.

Hopps: Most people adopt the second way. They still believe that the world will change even if they encounter hardships.

Hopps: But the real world never changes. It may present itself differently to you, but it is essentially always the same world.

Morridow: ...I disagree.

Hopps: As Chairwoman Ulrich's personal secretary, your naïvety will only cause you regret.

Morridow: I believe that's just the conclusion you've drawn from your experience in the war. Everyone thinks differently.

Angelia: Having a little chat?

Angelia: Morridow, what's the situation?

Morridow: Oh, right!

Morridow: The chairwoman has already dispatched a helicopter. It'll be here in about half an hour.

Angelia: That can't be the only thing she said.

Angelia: It doesn't take that long to talk about sending a helicopter.

Morridow: Uh...

Morridow: Frau Ulrich also mentioned that someone would like to remind us not to go overboard as this could jeopardize...

Angelia: A lot of people's interests, yeah?

Angelia: There's no end to all this politicking no matter which country I'm in.

Angelia: In times like this, only those with an iron will and stalwart strength can find their way out of plight.

Angelia: Does your Madam Chairwoman possess these qualities?

Morridow: I don't know...

Morridow: Perhaps you should ask her yourself. Frau Ulrich asked to speak with you in person again after this.

Angelia: That's assuming I survive.

Angelia: And stay away from the windows. J and I have found some information that Ulrich will find useful.

Angelia: Document them digitally and send her a copy.

Morridow: Okay!

Gazing at Ange's back, Morridow gives her handbag a thoughtful pat. The loaded magazines are still lying quietly in there.

Hopps: You heard her?

Morridow: Humph. Will you abandon Ange in an emergency?

Morridow: If perceiving the world using the third way is what makes a person worldly, what will you do?

Hopps: ...

Hopps: I will make sure nothing threatens the pain that I inflict.
Part 6: Delta Attack - End

    6chevron_right

...Zone B, Refugee Settlement.

Morridow: (Inhales and gags)

Morridow: Oof, this room stinks. I thought this organization was as "cheery" as it advertised itself, but...

J: I didn't take you for the type who'd fall for marketing ploys.

Morridow: I know it's all about marketing, but the least they could do is keep up a certain level of appearances. I didn't expect such a large difference.

Angelia: There are two sides to everything. This is also true about people.

Hopps: ...

J: The HR records here are intriguing. What do you make of this?

J: Some refugees have found employment in the White Zone—all floriculturists. There are about 1,400 of them, and all of them are working for that botanical institute you investigated.

Morridow: Huh? Surely the Flora Institute doesn't have that many vacancies?!

Angelia: This is confirmed in the ledger, and coincidentally, Powell is also the one who signed these receipts.

Angelia: This place has ties with both the orphanage and the botanical research institute.

J: So the GIP is really working with Paradeus?

Angelia: Most definitely, but we need more incontestable evidence.

Angelia: It wouldn't mean a thing to those bastards even if Ulrich threw what we've found at their faces.

Angelia: Lucia, how are things out there?

AK-12: There are more and more refugees surrounding the church.

AK-12: There are also people who don't look like refugees hidden in the crowd.

Angelia: We can't stay here for long.

Angelia: Renate, report.

Angelia: ...

Angelia: Renate?

Ange attempts to establish contact with RPK-16, but before the call can connect, a thunderous explosion erupts in Zone A.

Hopps immediately moves Ange behind him, but Ange steps around him and stares outside the window in silence.

More refugees have taken to the disordered streets due to the noise and tremor of the explosion.

Morridow: What was that?!

Hopps: The enemy must be on the move.

AN-94: Ange, there was an explosion of unknown origin in Zone A. The refugees are getting agitated. This is bad.

Angelia: That must've been a signal. Someone is about to get serious.

AN-94: We can't get in touch with Renate or AK-15.

AN-94: Ange, their comms are offline.

AK-12: Is it because of the explosion?

Just then, the "silence" is shattered by the klaxons that are blaring throughout the settlement.

J: Good God, what is it this time?!

(Beep)

Hopps: Speaking. What? Then what should we do?

Hopps: ...Understood. We'll think of something.

Angelia: What's wrong?

Hopps: The garrison guarding the gates are sustaining casualties...

Hopps: Someone has activated the turrets along the wall. Those things are now firing indiscriminately.

Morridow: What?! Then...what about the refugees?!

Hopps: ...They will prevent anything from passing through the gates alive—us, the refugees, or even just a rat...

Angelia: Looks like someone is trying to start a riot. It's easier for them to act when everyone is distracted by the chaos.

Angelia: Yeah, even our escape route is no-go.

Angelia: Our only hope of getting out of here is that helicopter.

J: Isn't this supposed to be a disastrous situation?

J: Somehow you said that in the same tone as how someone would say, "oh drat, there's only bread for breakfast today."

Angelia: It's kinda like that, actually.

Angelia: Lucia, can you join us?

AK-12: I can jump in through the roof.

AK-12 leans out of the window but AN-94, sensing something wrong in the distance, immediately pulls her back inside.

Bullets smash the window to bits. The two Dolls switch positions and try to locate the shooter.

AK-12: Ange, someone's firing at us!

AK-12: Can you see them from where you are?

Angelia: I heard it. Holy crap, what the heck are those?

A row of automatons are advancing on the church with riot shields and submachine guns, muzzles flashing menacingly.

The surrounding refugees scatter in panic but a lot of them are shot.

Hopps: The garrison's anti-riot automatons. Have they also been hacked?

Angelia: Not necessarily.

J: Our pistols won't even leave a dent on them.

J: They're closing in fast!

Angelia: Lucia, can you hack them?

AK-12: I've tried, but they can't be accessed remotely at all.

AK-12: All their ports are closed.

Angelia: They know us and they came prepared.

Angelia: You have permission to use your weapons. Link up with us once you destroy those automatons.

Angelia: We'll be leaving soon.

AK-12: Acknowledged.

AK-12: Antje, get out our rifles and prepare to move.

AN-94: Right.

AN-94: We don't have much ammo with us so we need to make every shot count.

AK-12 takes a second to observe the situation. Under such intense enemy fire, it's impossible to reach the church by jumping across rooftops.

She and AN-94 promptly return to ground level. A few of the anti-riot automatons are charging straight toward the church. The two Dolls take out the closest ones from around the corner.

With the most imminent threats neutralized, AK-12 reloads and makes for the church while keeping her body close to the ground.

The automatons start shifting their attention to AN-94, who proceeds to switch positions and lay down suppressive fire. Meanwhile, AK-12 dives next to a refugee's corpse, using it as a meat shield while returning fire at the enemies.

AK-12: They're pretty slow. This won't be too difficult.

AN-94: Lucia, watch out!

The anti-riot automaton that got shot down in front of AK-12 suddenly blows up.

Understanding the dreadful implication, she scrambles quickly to her feet and dashes towards the church.

94 also makes a run for it under the cover of the billowing smoke. They both reach the perimeter of the church with lightning speed.

AK-12: Ange, get out of there!

AK-12: The automatons are rigged with explosives! This church can't withstand the impact!

Angelia: Shit! They must be insane. Everyone out the windows!! NOW!!

More exploding anti-riot automatons are trying to break into the church. AK-12 stops their approach with accurate shots.

But the explosions are getting dangerously close to this eighth-century church. The weathered stones and bricks are starting to shake.

Ange smashes one of the mosaic glass windows on the second floor and jumps out. The others promptly follow suit.

J: Where did they get this amount of explosives?!

J: What the hell are they trying to do?

Hopps: We can't stay here any longer! We should retreat to the wall!

Angelia: And get shot full of holes by those turrets?

Angelia: Follow me!

Angelia: Morridow, can you run?

Morridow: I...I suppose...

Angelia: When I give the word, run with all your might and do not stop!

Angelia: J, if she can't keep up, carry her.

J: Alright!

AK-12: Ange, go!

AK-12: We're almost out of ammo!

Angelia: We're leaving our backs to you!

Ange's group start running towards the residential area while the two Dolls cover their escape.

AN-94: ...We've got to go too.

AK-12: No, we need to stay just a little longer.

AN-94: But we're running dangerously low on ammo and those automatons are getting close.

AK-12: Trust me, trust Ange, and trust our stupid teammates.

AK-12: We have to make our stand here.

AN-94: ...

AN-94: Understood. I trust you.

AN-94: Enemy reinforcements incoming!

Anti-riot automatons are making a beeline for the church, but the DEFY Dolls shoot them down accurately one after the other.

AK-12: Tsk, I'm out of ammo.

AN-94: Lucia, straight ahead!

With only one Doll firing, one of the anti-riot automatons has made it to the entrance of the church. AN-94's final round hits it on a weak spot. It topples and slides along the muddy ground, stopping right next to a building.

The next second, the automaton erupts in a dazzling ball of fire. The impact causes the rickety building to collapse instantaneously.

When the smoke and dust finally settle, there is already no sign of AK-12 and AN-94.

...

In an abandoned house about 100 meters away, a person puts down their binoculars.

Unknown Personnel: Sir, two of the target's Tactical Dolls are confirmed to be KIA.

Distorted Voice: Acknowledged. The target's unit is down to four people, and we will encounter no further T-Doll intervention.

Unknown Personnel: Only four? What about the other two Dolls?

Distorted Voice: Unknown. Nobody has been in touch since the explosion in Zone A 15 minutes ago. We haven't heard from our recon unit or task force either.

Unknown Personnel: Did the Dolls wipe them out?

Unknown Personnel: But how is that possible? There are only two of them, and they're not armed with explosives. Don't tell me...

Unknown Personnel: Oh crap, it must be them. Those bastards are making their move.

Unknown Personnel: Is the ground unit ready to deploy?

Distorted Voice: Yes, all ready.

Unknown Personnel: Then tell them to get the fire burning. We've got work to do, brothers.

Distorted Voice: Understood. Do you have any instructions for Pigeon?

Unknown Personnel: No, Pigeon is free to use their discretion.

Meanwhile, in a room on the second floor of a building in Zone B that was formerly the Kunsthalle Bremen, a unit of masked and well-armed personnel are listening to this conversation.

Armed Operative: Your heard the man. Let's get to work.

Officer in Command: Finally, the foreplay is over. It's time we made our entrance.

Officer in Command: Since we're all showing our hand, don't blame me for not pulling my punches.

Officer in Command: These voodoo fanatics think they'll be bagging all the chips, but little do they know we still have an ace up our sleeve.

Officer in Command: Alright, listen up. I don't want any of them to leave the refugee settlement alive. Send them all to meet their beloved maker.

Armed Force: Yes, sir!

Ange's group move rapidly down the street while keeping their eyes on their surroundings.

Ange watches as wafts of black smoke billow into the sky. She knows what's producing them. Garbage and tires being burned. An omen of imminent pandemonium.

After looking left and right, Ange kicks open the door to a tall building and leads the others inside.

From the window upstairs, she can see that a massive crowd has been gathering. Dreadful howls fill the air.

Another explosion erupts in the distance. Morridow stares at Ange hesitantly.

There are questions she is burning to ask, but somehow she can't bring herself to voice them as she studies Ange's calm features.

J: The refugees are already on the verge of a riot in a matter of minutes.

J: The GIP aren't the only ones that have infiltrated the settlement. It looks like even Powell himself has been stirring the pot here. He must be far more influential than we thought.

Hopps: They rile up the refugees and start a riot; we conveniently "go missing" in the midst of this chaos and won't cause any more trouble.

Hopps: Did you expect this to happen, Frau Ange?

Angelia: Their plan isn't all that surprising. Actually, it's so logical it's almost unnerving.

Angelia: It's true that I didn't expect them to go to such great lengths just to eliminate us, but it's not over for us yet.

Angelia: We may still be able to capture Powell.

Hopps: Are you out of your mind?!

Hopps: How are we supposed to catch that bastard when all hell has broken loose out there?!

Hopps: We should find a safe location and wait for the helicopter to extract us!

Angelia: My Dolls have sent me Powell's last-known coordinates.

Angelia: I'm not leaving until I have him. If you're scared of the mess outside, stay here and keep Morridow safe.

Morridow: Huh?! Do we have to stay here?

Morridow: I'd rather go with Ange!

Hopps: Are you all insane?!

Hopps: I can't keep all of you safe out there without any extra help!

J: Don't worry, I will also guard the ladies with my life~

Angelia: With K being the only exception, do all German guys talk like idiots?

Angelia: Still, even though you're cringy as hell, I do appreciate the support.

Angelia: Well, Hopps? You can stay here by yourself if that's what you want.

Hopps: Tsk...!

Hopps: Fine, but we'd better hurry!

Hopps: Do you know where to find Powell?

Angelia: I'll manage.

Angelia: But hold on a sec. Something doesn't look right down there.

Morridow: The weird howling is getting closer...

Morridow: It sounds really scary...

Ange looks out of the window again.

Amid the rising black smoke and surging crowds, she catches sight of creatures that don't exactly look human.

Angelia: I knew you'd be here.

Angelia: It's time I dragged you out of your hidey hole...William.

Inside the Griffin base, the Café has finally returned to its usual hustle and bustle as more and more Dolls are revived.

The commotion-loving Dolls are gathered here, toasting each other happily to celebrate their rebirth.

Now that the last of the Sangvis plant investigation missions are over, the Dolls have dragged me to this crowded place.

After fooling around with them for a while, the Dolls finally lose interest in messing with me, and I can free myself to get a drink.

I look around at the venue and finally spot Kalina in a dimly-lit corner.

She looks completely exhausted. Clearly she must have spent many sleepless nights to get the Dolls back into normal working order.

I hesitate briefly, then head over to her, drink in hand.

I stand beside her and tilt my head, questioning. She looks up at me, then lowers her head once more.

Fortunately, she hasn't fled this time, so I take it as implicit permission to sit at the same table.

Commander: Still angry?

Kalina: Not really...

Commander: Then why aren't you having fun with the others?

Kalina: I'm scared that I won't be able to see something like this again, so I want to sit aside and just watch quietly.

Commander: ...For some reason, gloomy things like that sound strange coming from you.

Kalina: Hey, even I can feel down at times, you know!

Commander: So you're still mad, huh...

I take another look at Kalina, and I suddenly realize that in spite of all the battles she has experienced, she's still just a girl in her twenties.

I've always taken her strength and reliability as a given, and my taking her for granted, combined with my presumptuousness, must have been very hurtful.

Kalina is still rather huffy. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but changes her mind after a hesitant pause.

After some thought, I've come to the conclusion that since she got angry because of me, I should be the one to offer an olive branch.

Commander: It's been nearly a week. Have you decided what you're going to do yet?

Kalina's eyes darken at the question. She takes a sip out of her drink and redirects the question to me in a nonchalant tone.

Kalina: Have YOU decided what you're going to do, Commander?

Commander: Hm... Well, since the Dolls are all repaired...

Commander: Naturally, we ought to put them through a standard 24-day course of combat simulations.

Commander: We need to get our Dolls back into shape. I'm guessing you may need to spend a bit more time fine-tuning them.

Kalina: Oh... Wait, what?? So...you're not going to leave us?

Commander: I never ever said I would leave...

Kalina: R...Really?

Kalina: So you're really not going to quit your post?

Commander: I told you, didn't I? I threw that Green Zone ID pass into the trash on the first day. It's probably in pieces in the garbage disposal now.

Kalina: Yeah, I know that.

Kalina: But you never gave me a definite answer, and you told me to go off by myself...

Commander: I was kidding, of course. I'd have a really hard time if you actually left.

Commander: After all, I don't want to take all that logistics work onto myself.

Kalina: Really?

Kalina: You're not lying to me again, are you?

Commander: But I never lied to you in the first place...

Commander: If you don't believe me, you can search my body and see if that ID pass is still there.

Commander: And if that doesn't work for you, you can search my room too.

Commander: But right now, I'm not going anywhere.

Kalina: Com...Commander, you...you big jerk! I was so worried!

Kalina: Do you know what I've been going through this whole week?

Kalina: Not a day went by when I wasn't thinking about what I'd do if you suddenly decided to leave us!

Kalina: I was...worried sick...every day... (Sobs)

Commander: I...I'm sorry... At first I was just messing with you.

Commander: But I didn't expect you to give me the cold shoulder after that...

Kalina: That's because I WAS mad!

Kalina: I was thinking, "If you're going to suddenly vanish someday, then I should just keep my distance from you!"

Commander: I...I see... But then why...

Kalina: But I...I just couldn't do it!

Kalina: I was going to avoid you altogether, but I found myself in the Command Room each day before I realized it!

Commander: I...I'm so sorry...

Commander: How about this... Wait, let me think... Ah, I've got it! As an apology, why don't we swap jobs?

Kalina: What?!

Commander: That is to say, you get to be the Commander and give me orders, and I'll be your adjutant. I mean, we don't have any missions pending, so we can probably do it for a day...

Kalina: Commander... Are you serious about that?

Commander: Yep.

Commander: I'll do anything you want. You can take your anger out on me anytime.

Commander: How...how's that?

Kalina: Pffft...

Kalina: Pff...hahahaha!

Kalina: Well, that's our Commander for you, you always come up with stuff that normal people could never even conceive of. That's so dumb!

Kalina: If you were our logistics officer, I doubt any of our Dolls would have working weapons if they went out on a mission.

Kalina: In the end, I'd get yelled at anyway.

Commander: So what can I do to make it up to you?

Kalina: Hmm... Let me think...

Kalina: You're not allowed to lie to me for the rest of your life.

Kalina: How about that, Commander? Do you think you can keep that promise?

Commander: Is that all?

Kalina: Yeah, that's all.

Commander: Then I promise you, I won't lie to you ever again.

Kalina: Hehehe, you'd better keep your word, okay?

Ten years later, as I look out through the train windows at the quarantine wall under the setting sun in the distance, I think back to this scene.

The orange-yellow light of dusk spreads over the quarantine wall and limns it in a golden glow, like syrup on a pancake.

As I recall all the things that have gone by, it suddenly occurs to me just how much that brief period of respite in my life has meant to me.

At that time, I did not realize how lucky and happy I was.

As everything changed with the passage of time, the faces of the past had blurred into unreachability with each day that went by.

I recall the words I couldn't say when I bade her farewell just now. I know that even if I had said them, they would have been pointless anyway.

Even if I am still my old self, she is no longer the same woman.

However, I do not resent her for changing, because in the end, I have not been able to keep the promise I made her ten years ago.

...

Kalina: (Yawns)... I'm so sleepy all of a sudden.

Kalina: Now that I'm not worried anymore, the fatigue from the past few days has caught up with me all at once...

Commander: Go back to the dorm and get some rest. There's no telling how long the Dolls are going to keep this up.

Commander: We'll worry about the cleanup tomorrow.

Kalina: O...Okay...

Kalina: Then I'll see you tomorrow, Commander...

Kalina: (Yawns) So sleepy...

Kalina drags her exhausted body out of the Café.

Hopefully she'll be back to normal tomorrow. Having a grim-faced adjutant standing behind me was sending chills down my spine.

Dandelion: Is this seat taken, Commander?

Commander: ...What are you doing here?

Commander: Didn't I tell you not to show up in front of the others?

Dandelion: Well, the only other human who can see me besides yourself has already gone to bed, so coming out for a stroll shouldn't be a problem.

Commander: ...Have you been spying on us again?

Dandelion: I'm just curious about the relationship you have with your adjutant.

Dandelion: But I didn't expect her to be so tractable.

Dandelion: It's almost as if the two of you were trying to beat each other in being the biggest pushover.

Commander: Ahem, did you come all the way just to make fun of me?

Dandelion: I've obtained some information, but it's not particularly urgent.

Dandelion: After all, such moments of respite are precious and fleeting.

Dandelion: There's no harm in letting it wait.

I follow her gaze to the center of the Café, and the raucous atmosphere washes over me like a wave.

Anna: Quit struggling and let me pinch you!

Gr G11: Ugh... Let go... My face...

Gr G11: Help me... Ughh...

UMP9: Hahahaha, Gr G11's face looks so dorky!

AUG Para: It looks fun, I want to pinch her too!

VHS: Pipe down. The head maid's going to come over and scold us.

Gr G36: Alright, you girls, don't make trouble in the Café. Go back to the dorms if you want to fool around.

Anna: Uwah! Run for it!

Gr G36: Don't run around in the Café! It's dangerous—you'll hit someone!

Springfield: Let them off this once, Gr G36. It's good that the place is so lively after so long.

Gr G36: (Sighs) From tolerance all sin is born.

Gr G36: These Dolls make trouble in the Café because you're always so lenient.

I exhale and look away from them.

This normal, everyday life with no surprises is what I'm trying to protect with every fiber of my being.

Commander: So, what is this information you were talking about?

Dandelion: Ooh, eager, aren't we. Are you in such a hurry to go on a mission again?

Commander: I don't want to end up regretting my present laziness in the future.

Dandelion: In that case, come with me.

Dandelion rises and leaves the Café.

I give Springfield a nod, then put on my coat and follow her out.

...

It's not fall yet, but there's a chill in the air outdoors.

Commander: Huh, so you're all here.

As I expected, the AR Team is gathered in a clearing outside the base.

Dandelion: I've brought the Commander along, as I promised.

RO635: Thank you, you've done us a favor.

Commander: Did you send Dandelion to find me?

Commander: Why didn't you come over in person?

RO635: The idea of going in there somehow makes me a bit uncomfortable...

ST AR-15: After all, it's best for us to keep a distance from the other Dolls, since we're members of the AR Team and all.

M4 SOPMOD II: I knew the Commander would come, now the Commander is allllll ours!

Commander: That sounds a little frightening, coming from you...

RO635: Ahem... Actually, we asked you out here today because we have an imposition to make.

RO635: I know it might cause you trouble but please hear us out.

RO635: Dandelion, please show the Commander.

Dandelion: Here, Commander, look at this.

Commander: This house is...?

Dandelion: There's no doubt about it. This is the house which keeps appearing in Lunasia's neural cloud.

Dandelion: It is her "home", stored in the depths of her memories.

ST AR-15: I once saw this place on the base layer of her neural cloud.

Dandelion: Havier's intelligence network seems to have news about Ange's work in Germany. Their Stasi over there seems to have found an identical house to this one.

Commander: You hacked into Havier's computer?!

Dandelion: I just left a little, tiny backdoor. He won't notice it.

Dandelion: It was Ange's activities in Germany which led to the Stasi discovering this place by accident.

Commander: Looks like Ange's gone through a lot over there...

Commander: So what do you have in mind?

RO635: Commander, the AR Team has decided. We won't give up on looking for M4 or M16 no matter what.

RO635: No matter how big the world is, I believe that as long as we continue existing within it, we will meet again someday.

RO635: Therefore, we're hoping that we can find a way to get to that place and see if we can obtain a lead about M4.

RO635: Of course, I know this might make things rather difficult for you, but please let us leave you for a while. I'm sure we'll bring back good news.

Commander: I refuse.

RO635: Huh?

Commander: If we're looking for our lost Dolls, I cannot let just the few of you go off by yourselves.

ST AR-15: Commander, what do you mean?

Commander: While I can't make any guarantees right now, I'll try to verify the information about that house.

Commander: If it warrants a proper investigation, I won't just send the AR Team by yourselves and expose you to danger.

Commander: Don't worry. As a Commander of Griffin, I won't leave any Dolls behind.

M4 SOPMOD II: Awesome, the Commander has the same idea!

Commander: Yeah, I won't leave anyone behind.

Commander: But you need to promise me that you'll obey orders once the mission begins and you won't run off on your own.

Commander: We are a team; every person and every Doll here is your friend and your comrade, and our fates are bound together.

Commander: Can you promise me that?

The three Dolls exchange glances and nod in unison.

I nod back in acknowledgement.

Commander: I will give thorough consideration to the entire plan. Also, Persica will be arriving tomorrow. You should let her give you all a checkup.

Commander: Now, since that's still a few hours away, why don't you head over to the Café and have some fun?

RO635: Thanks, but no thanks, Commander.

RO635: We'll be off then. You should get some rest too.

Commander: Right. Good night.

The Dolls take their leave, talking and laughing.

I look at RO's receding back and realize that she's become a lot more mature than before.

I stick my hands into my pockets. For some reason, I feel much more at ease now.

Dandelion: You promised the moon so casually, Commander.

Commander: Did I make the wrong choice?

Commander: You want to find M4 too, don't you?

Dandelion: Indeed, that is what I want. I also know we will have to pay a price to achieve that.

Commander: So you're saying I shouldn't have made that promise?

Dandelion: I simply think you might not be ready yet.

Commander: But we've won all this time, haven't we?

Commander: If we stand still, then all our efforts will be wasted.

Commander: I simply want to do something for those girls. After all, their previous sacrifices deserve to be repaid.

Dandelion: You have a point.

Dandelion: And you WOULD think like this now. I do wish you will never change.

Commander: Spoken like you know my future.

Dandelion: You could say that.

Commander: Huh?

Dandelion: But the future is not set in stone, so remember our promises.

Dandelion: Before you step into the grave, tell me what you think of this world.

Dandelion: Until then, never stop striving, never stop struggling. That's the most interesting thing about humans, after all.
Part 2: Bridge of Eternity

    2chevron_right

The Germans' tiltrotor military aircraft takes off smoothly. Ange helps the injured secretary settle into her seat and sits down herself.

Under the engines' continuous thrum, the two women suddenly feel the full force of their fatigue. They both let out a heavy sigh before looking at each other.

Angelia: Does your leg still hurt?

Morridow: It's just a graze... I feel like my trauma is more mental than physical...

Angelia: Really?

Angelia: You look pretty perky to me.

Morridow: It's all just an act!

Morridow: I was scared out of my mind!

Angelia: I told you before we entered the settlement. I thought you were prepared.

Morridow: I was prepared...

Morridow: But I never thought Hopps would be a GIP spy.

Morridow: No wonder Chairwoman Ulrich was always a bit distant around him. She must've known something wasn't right.

Angelia: If Ulrich noticed, so should her secretary, right?

Morridow: Actually, both Hopps and I have started working for Frau Ulrich only fairly recently. To be honest, I didn't know him all that well.

Morridow: He was transferred from the municipal office. We weren't too close in private, but since there hasn't been any problem with security, nobody raised any objections.

Angelia: We didn't make any headway in our investigation at all.

Angelia: (Sighs) What a disappointing trip.

Ange recalls the incidents in the last few days and flicks her hand impatiently.

Seeing her in such deep chagrin, Morridow smiles and tries to console her.

Morridow: Don't give up, Frau Ange.

Morridow: You haven't been here for long. I'm sure things will go better.

Morridow: Just rest up for now.

Angelia: You're right.

Ange rests her chin on a hand and stares thoughtfully at Morridow.

Morridow: What are you thinking about?

Angelia: I'm thinking about what happened in the refugee settlement. There are still a lot of mysteries that haven't been explained.

Morridow: Mysteries?

Morridow: But haven't we already exposed the traitor Hopps?

Angelia: The only reason why I have Ulrich's and K's cooperation is that we have a common enemy.

Angelia: As for why the GIP didn't succeed in capturing us, that's because said enemy doesn't want me to end up in their hands.

Morridow: I thought the GIP plainclothes failed because they and Powell were tripping each other up.

Angelia: The ELID mutation was triggered by the strange powder, which caused something quite similar to what we experienced at the botanical institute.

Angelia: I doubt Powell had the influence to acquire that kind of stuff.

Morridow: You mean it's the same enemy behind the Flora Institute and the refugee settlement?

Angelia: I believe so.

Morridow: So...someone else other than the GIP have their eyes on us.

Morridow: Please help me report this to Chairwoman Ulrich later.

Morridow: We must take all necessary precautions.

Angelia: That's certainly a good idea.

Angelia: But for now, I have a few other questions.

Morridow: Oh, what questions?

Angelia: Our enemy has always been one step ahead of us throughout our investigation.

Angelia: I suspect I might be missing something important.

Angelia: Which is why I would like to ask you some questions, Miss Morridow. I hope you don't mind.

Ange strokes her chin contemplatively as she probes the secretary.

Confronted with Ange's tactful query, Morridow offers a polite answer in return.

Morridow: Please go ahead, Frau Ange. I will tell you everything I know.

Angelia: If I remember correctly, while we were at the Flora Institute, the hallucinogen also rendered you unconscious, correct?

Morridow: Of course. You saw it yourself.

Angelia: Indeed, you were knocked out for some time like the rest of us.

Angelia: But I've noticed that the substance tend to trigger some kind of allergic reaction in people. Hopps and I had nosebleeds.

Angelia: It also happened to J at the refugee camp after he came into contact with the hallucinogen floating in the air.

Angelia: However, you did not seem to have experienced such allergic reaction yourself.

Morridow: Allergic reaction? This kind of thing varies with each individual. I didn't have something as obvious as a nosebleed.

Morridow: Maybe my body simply has more resistance.

Angelia: Perhaps.

Angelia: Then there's another matter concerning the orphanage.

Angelia: Renate told me that while she was searching the different rooms, she saw a girl asking you for candy, but you said you didn't have any.

Morridow: Oh, I really didn't have any candy on me. What's the problem with that?

Angelia: What's strange isn't the fact that you didn't have any candy, but the fact that the children at the orphanage asked you for candy when they saw you.

Angelia: Have you been to the orphanage before?

Angelia: Why would the children know you?

Morridow: Oh...

Morridow: Actually, we've visited this orphanage in the past as it is on PECMAR's list of prospective beneficiaries.

Morridow: That's also why we could arrange your visit with the housemother at such short notice.

Angelia: I see.

Morridow: Speaking of candy.

Morridow: Do you want some?

Morridow: I think it's important to replenish your sugar levels when you're in a bad mood.

Angelia: You have a point.

Morridow fetches a pack of candy from her handbag. Ange extends a hand to accept it.

Angelia: I'm sorry. I'm just trying to sort through the events and figure out what really happened.

Angelia: I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable. Please don't take this personally.

Morridow: No problem at all. I know you have your duties, and I'm happy to answer your questions.

Morridow: They don't have to be about work either. Feel free to ask me anything at all.

Angelia: I do find something very strange. Something not exactly related to work.

Morridow: Strange?

Morridow: What do you mean?

Angelia: This, for instance.

The hand Ange has been holding out suddenly snakes around to Morridow's back.

She removes the pistol that's been hidden on Morridow's belt in an instant.

She then immediately disengages the safety and points the pistol directly at Morridow, while keeping two paces away from her.

Angelia: I remember you said you didn't know how to use firearms before we entered the settlement.

Angelia: But you were about to draw your weapon when Hopps was holding you at gunpoint, weren't you?

Angelia: Why did you lie?

Morridow: Oh... Uh...

Morridow: I...I'm so sorry... Actually, the chairwoman asked me to bring along a weapon before I left.

Morridow: I've had some training, but I'm not good at it at all...

Morridow: Back then it looked like I was done for, so I thought I might as well give it a shot...

Angelia: Oh?

Angelia: Is that so?

Morridow: It's true!

Morridow: Please stop pointing the gun at me! You're scaring me...!

Angelia: Your explanation is flawless, but that's some really terrible acting.

Angelia: That's not a look someone with absolutely zero combat experience would give me.

Morridow: Frau Ange, please stop pulling my leg.

Morridow: Or I might really get crossed.

Angelia: Before you do that, why don't you have a piece of your candy?

Angelia: I suppose it contains some kind of chemical that stabilizes your emotion?

Morridow: It's just some normal candy!

Morridow: Enough with the slander, Frau Ange.

Morridow: The aircraft will soon reach the location where we'll be meeting Frau Ulrich, and you can tell her all about your suspicions!

Morridow: You can investigate me all you like, but in the end, I will prove to be innocent!

Angelia: Will you? Then I look forward to—

Before Ange can finish, the bearing of the secretary, who has been pleading with her beseechingly with tears in her eyes, shifts dramatically.

She swipes at the gun pointed at her with her left hand without warning, disrupting Ange's aim.

The unexpected strike causes Ange to pull the trigger out of reflex before the pistol gets knocked out of her hand.

The fired bullet misses its target and hits the wall of the aircraft behind the secretary instead.

Angelia: Hm?!

Taken aback by Morridow's CQC skills, Ange quickly collects herself. She draws her own sidearm and fires another shot directly at Morridow's chest.

However, Morridow's movements once again take her completely by surprise. She reacts almost instantaneously as the shot is fired—faster than what a normal human is capable of.

She ducks out of the bullet's trajectory so quickly it only brushes past her shoulder.

When she straightens up again, the secretary's characteristic genteel smile has vanished, replaced by cold, deadly features contorted into an uncanny grin.

Angelia: ?!

Morridow: Shooting a friend straight in the heart? My, you're stone cold.

Angelia: Haha... I was just bluffing you. Didn't expect you to drop the act just like that.

Angelia: And your reaction speed... Are you a Doll?

Angelia: No, that can't be right. Erwin didn't notice anything strange about you. A new model of Nyto, maybe?

Morridow: Both of those guesses are kind of insulting.

Angelia: While I was dragging you along in the refugee settlement, no matter how much danger we were in, your pulse was very steady the whole time.

Angelia: You're the one behind the appearance of those mutants, I suppose?

Angelia: Since those stupid GIP members wouldn't leave me alone, you just got rid of them.

Morridow: Hopps, the GIP... Those idiots are all just disposable pawns.

Morridow: You're exactly right. My objective has only ever been you, Angelia.

Morridow: But I'm surprised. I thought you would've completely let down your guard around me after we went through fire and water together.

Angelia: Went through fire and water.

Angelia: What a joke.

Angelia: I have absolutely no interest in being such good friends with some Paradeus cultist.

Morridow: Sure, run your mouth. You only have a few more minutes anyway.

Angelia: Humph... So the plane is as shady as you.

Morridow: Too late. We will arrive at our destination very soon.

Morridow: We'll continue our earnest conversation once we reach the base.

Morridow: I'm sure we can talk all day...until you spill everything Father wants to know.

Angelia: Humph, then I'll have to kill you before it comes to that.

The air grows tense in the enclosed space. Ange takes the initiative and breaks the stillness of their confrontation.

Now that she knows her opponent is a Paradeus member with superhuman reflexes, there is no need to hold back anymore. This time, Ange fires directly at her head.

Morridow ducks and charges at Ange immediately.

Without pausing, Ange draws upon her training and fires another two shots at her chest.

Morridow blocks the bullets with her right arm and flings her handbag at Ange.

The pain causes Ange to flinch for a second. Exploiting this momentary weakness, Morridow closes the distance and disarms Ange with a precise kick.

Angelia: She's fast!

Having drawn close to Ange, Morridow gives her no time to react.

She brings down her suspended left leg on Ange's neck and grabs Ange by the dominant arm, then she grapples Ange to the floor, immobilizing the upper half of her body.

With her left arm held in a death grip, Ange tries to break free, but more she struggles, the more force Morridow applies.

Her shoulder joint is screaming in agony.

Morridow: It's time you recognized the truth, Angelia! Join us!

Morridow: Instead of serving those corrupt and obsolete people in the upper crust, follow Paradeus and lead mankind into the future we deserve!

Angelia: You mean a future where everyone gets turned into irradiated zombies?

Morridow: Necessary sacrifices!

Believing that she has the upper hand, Morridow lets down her guard slightly.

Ange seizes this opportunity and draws a combat knife from her belt with her right hand. She then raises the knife and smashes the hilt into her left arm. Her mechanical limb falls off with a clatter.

With her leverage suddenly gone, Morridow sees a flash of white light and rolls aside immediately.

However, the blood seeping through her clothes on one side of her torso shows that Ange's attack has done the trick.

Morridow: Tsk, don't get cocky.

Angelia: So you're not covered in alloy, Miss Nyto.

Angelia: I was wondering which part of you is human.

Morridow: I'm not a Nyto. I'm 100% human.

Morridow: I'm just superior to you.

Angelia: Sounds familiar. That's exactly something a new type of Nyto would say.

Angelia: Those GIP nationalists can't hold a candle to you.

Ange gets to her feet and slowly backs away with her knife pointed at Morridow.

Morridow: Are you trying to anger me? What good would that do?

Morridow: No matter what I am, there will always be an unbridgeable gap between you and me.

Morridow: We are thousands of feet in the air; where can you hide?

Morridow charges in once more. Ange can barely fend off her attack with just a right arm.

Angelia: An unbridgeable gap, huh... You're right, Morridow, we are separated by an unbridgeable gap.

Angelia: But not in terms of our physical strength. You will never understand.

Morridow: Prove it to me, Angelia.

Morridow: Prove me wrong. What can you do?

Angelia: Humph...

Angelia: Lucia!

Ange bellows, and a familiar figure slowly strolls through the cabin door with a wicked smile.

Morridow's face slackens in shock. She is having trouble comprehending this unexpected turn of events.

AK-12: Oh wow, it's been a while since I last saw you get your hands beautifully dirty in a fight, Ange.

AK-12: I thought you didn't need any help and was going to let you take all the credit this time.

Morridow: Why are you... When did you...

Morridow: ...Angelia, you tricked me?

Angelia: You got careless just because you thought you had it in the bag.

Angelia: I suggest you take a look out the window, Morridow.

Morridow: ...!

Morridow turns abruptly to peer outside through the window of the cabin.

Instead of flying south out of the city as she had planned, the freighter is heading towards Magdeburg, where the Soviet Army's External Group of Forces is stationed.

Morridow: How long have you been spinning this web around me?

AK-12: Ange was worried that you wouldn't fall for the ploy, so she asked us to make it look like we got taken out.

AK-12: I've been following you the whole time and I slipped aboard the freighter the moment it landed.

AK-12: Then I had a long chat with your pilot, who happily agreed to catch a nap while I fly the plane.

Morridow: Tsk... I shouldn't have expected so much from the GIP trash.

Angelia: That's right. Neither Powell nor the GIP managed to kill anyone on Task Force DEFY.

Angelia: I was using myself as bait and waiting for big fish like you to bite the hook, but you didn't even suspect it; you just leaped right out of the water—both you and Hopps.

Angelia: You lost it all from the moment you followed me into the refugee settlement, Morridow.

Morridow: Lost? I don't think so, Angelia.

Morridow: Your Wolf Pack may be pretty strong, but it makes no difference to me.

AK-12 aims her weapon straight at the exposed Paradeus agent, her wide-open violet eyes glinting dangerously.

AK-12: I wouldn't try anything funny if I were you.

AK-12: You may have faster reflexes than Ange, but this military-grade Tactical Doll and her automatic rifle would be more than happy to entertain you—with 5.45x39mm full metal jacket AP rounds.

AK-12: Unlike Ange, I don't have a "gone through fire and water together" kind of bond with you. It'd be terrible if my finger slips and I shoot you into Swiss cheese.

Morridow: Oh gee, I'm so scared.

Morridow: If you randomly open fire in this pressurized cabin, we'll all die.

Morridow: You don't want your master to go splat, do you?

AK-12: First of all, Ange isn't my master, just my commander.

AK-12: Secondly, we've prepared parachutes beforehand.

AK-12: Though supply is obviously limited.

Morridow: ...

While they are sparring with words, Morridow slowly inches back.

Just as AK-12 takes notice of her minute movement, Morridow spins around and delivers a side kick.

AK-12 pulls the trigger immediately.

The bullet goes straight through Morridow's leg just before the kick connects.

Blood spurts out of the wounds, causing Morridow to pause in shock.

Bang.

Another gunshot rings out.

This time, the bullet burrows straight into Morridow's unprotected shoulder.

She collapses onto the floor due to the crippling pain.

More blood gushes out, steeping her clothes in crimson wetness. She clasps her shoulder in pain and props herself up against the cabin wall.

Ange stares at her coldly, pistol in hand.

Angelia: Stop trying. It won't work.

Angelia: Since you're oh-so-superior, surely you can tell you don't stand a chance at all.

Morridow: ...So 5.45mm AP rounds can still inflict damage on me at this distance.

Morridow: Hahaha, that's some important data.

Morridow cranes her head up and flashes them a goading smile.

In response to the Paradeus agent's taunt, Ange raises her pistol and aims at her head.

Angelia: None of your tricks.

Angelia: We need you alive so that you can tell us all about William when we get back to Chairwoman Ulrich.

Morridow: Don't count on it.

With that...

Morridow grabs one of the seats in the cabin. Then comes the sound of metal and cables rupturing.

Snap!

Angelia & AK-12: What?!

Morridow throws the torn-off chair at Ange and AK-12. Ange immediately opens fire but her shot is blocked by the chair.

After a bang, air comes tearing and howling in through the cabin door. They realize right away that Morridow has flung open the emergency exit.

Angelia: Dammit! Hold on tight!

It's too late to stop her. Ange grabs a handrail out of reflex, which saves her life.

Meanwhile, also gripping a handrail, Morridow tears out another seat and throws it into the aircraft's nacelle. As the rotor lets out a horrific screech, the entire tiltrotor aircraft starts rocking violently.

With one of the rotors down, the damaged plane spins out of control, knocking everyone onboard off balance.

Angelia: Lucia, get into the cockpit!

Angelia: Try to land this damn thing!

AK-12: On it!

Angelia: You freaking lunatic! Trying to make us join you in hell, huh?

Angelia: Not in a million years!

Morridow: And you think I'll just go quietly with you? "Not in a million years!"

Morridow: There, I'm saying it right back at you, Angelia.

Morridow: Perhaps you'll miss me and come to treasure the time we've spent together.

Morridow: But don't worry, we'll meet again very soon~

Then Morridow throws herself out of the emergency exit and off the freighter.

The aircraft is still continuing its treacherous descent. Ange peers through the window while hanging on for dear life.

However, all she sees is a splash on the surface of the Elbe.

Angelia: So Nytos can already be fully merged with humans...?

Angelia: How many more places have these Paradeus spies infiltrated?

Angelia: Is activating the Relic William's sole objective?

Angelia: The situation here is even more complex than our own country, but no matter how he tries to hide, his twitchy tail has finally given him away.

Angelia: He is right here in Germany. Now it's my turn to go on the offensive.

Angelia: Just you wait, Morridow, William.

Angelia: It won't be long now.

...

【Dual Randomness - END】

(Missing mission ID, can't load credits! Go yell at the site owner!)

After sending off the ambulance that will transport J to the hospital, K climbs into the van with Hopps in the prisoner compartment and prepares to drive off.

Only when the van is safely on the road does he glance at the Doll sitting right behind him.

K: ...

AN-94: ...

K: Hm...

K: Ange really doesn't trust me, huh?

AN-94: I am here under Ange's order to help you. Please don't read too much into it.

K: ...

AN-94: ...

K: ...Cigarette?

AN-94: I don't smoke...

K: Say... No matter how you look at it, J looks more like a spy than I do, don't you think?

AN-94: ...

K: ...

K: Nevermind. You guys don't let anything slip by. That's what makes you perfect for this job.

AN-94: ...

K: Wanna go out for a drink later?

AN-94: No, thanks.

The van drives on in oppressive silence.

K stares at the glowing tip of his cigarette without taking a single drag.

K: Hey, right now, don't you think we look like we're...

AN-94: Not at all.

Bremen, Germany. Lower reaches of the Weser river.

This area is a considerable distance away from any human settlements.

The spaces within 50 meters on both sides of the river have been blocked off by black vans and cordoned with tape.

With a helicopter rumbling overhead, a young man treks along the moss-covered path by the river with a briefcase in hand.

???: ...

He can hear the conversation over the radio through the foliage.

Stasi Agent A: Zone D1 search complete. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Stasi Agent B: Zone A2 search complete. Nothing out of the ordinary.

K: Copy that. Keep searching and extend the perimeter by 1km.

K: Attention—"Rabbit" has escaped. Keep your eyes peeled and don't even miss a single tuft of her fur.

Stasi Agents A & B: Roger.

The Stasi search agents have been working around the clock on the riverbanks for over 24 hours.

It has already been five days since Angelia crossed the German border.

There is a faint rustle of a coat brushing over shrubbery. Detecting the approaching presence, K turns around.

As he makes out who it is, his rising unease disappears.

???: Sir.

K: Come.

???: Yes, sir.

The young man walks over to K.

His sharp gaze shifts to the river, where boats are still busy searching.

K: Time is short so I'll keep it brief.

K: Let's get straight to the point. You know why I've summoned you, Light?

Light: Yes, I understand it is about Frau Angelia.

K: Have you read the report?

Light: Yes, I am well aware of everything leading up to the confrontation between Frauen Angelia and Morridow.

Light: It is J who has been following the case, isn't it?

K: He's currently out of action, so you'll have to take over.

K: Now's your moment—have you chosen a letter for yourself?

Light: Please stop making fun of me.

Light: J is an exceptional agent—I still have much to learn from him.

K: Aw, where's your sense of humor?

Light: I thought you said time was short.

K: You little... Nevermind.

K turns and directs his attention back to the boats in the river.

K: Do you think Morridow died in there?

Light: Difficult to say. None of the witnesses on the aircraft saw the moment of impact.

Light: Even a well-trained agent could easily die when falling from that height.

Light: Such a plunge could be fatal for ordinary civilians.

K: But our little secretary is no ordinary civilian.

Light: That's true, and that's the problem.

Light: According to Frau Angelia, Morridow is a new type of augmented human under the major criminal organization Paradeus.

Light: Apparently, her strength is on par with AK-12 of the Wolf Pack.

K: All information concerning Paradeus is still top secret.

K: We're making an exception here by filling you in, you understand?

Light: Yes.

K: The aircraft bound for Chairwoman Ulrich's office building deviated from its original flight path yesterday.

K: The witnesses' accounts corroborate the fact that the confrontation took place as the aircraft was passing over the Wedersee.

Light: Are the witnesses the pilot and Frau Angelia herself?

K: Indeed.

K: The scuffle lasted about six minutes, and when they reached the river, the suspect—Morridow—concluded that her plan had failed and decided to escape by jumping off the plane.

K: Once I caught word of the incident, I immediately sealed off the area within 5km of the scene. It was done in a rush, but I do not doubt the effectiveness of the blockade.

Light: But there is still no sign of her?

K shrugs.

K: We can only assume that she has already left the scene before we got here.

K: Otherwise, I'll have to chalk it up to her being soluble in water.

Light: ...

K: But it's not all doom and despair.

K: We have found some clues.

K taps his foot, indicating the stretch of the riverbank that they are standing on.

K: An hour ago, we found the torn-off cabin door here.

K: There were bloodstains on it—this is still confidential information.

Light: Bloodstains? ...Frau Angelia did mention that Morridow was injured.

K: I've had the surrounding area searched, but we haven't been able to locate her.

Light: Can we extrapolate her path of escape?

K: No, there is too little blood for that.

K: Besides, the river itself makes that impossible.

Light: What if we narrow it down based on the time she jumped?

Light: If we calculate her trajectory and draw a radius...

K: I like your quick thinking.

K: This is the first task I have for you. Here's the investigation report.

Light: Right.

Light: Forgive me for being blunt, but this is no different than looking for a needle in a haystack.

Light: Also, if our manpower is stretched too thin, even if we locate the suspect, it will be difficult to capture her.

Light: Isn't she some sort of monster that can fight toe-to-toe against an elite T-Doll?

K: That's right, which is why no one will blame you if you conduct the search...in a leisurely manner.

Light: ...

Light: ...So the second task is what actually matters?

K: Yes...that is correct.

K: I just received new orders.

K: Once the investigation here is complete, you are to head straight to Berlin.

K: Isn't that exciting? You'll get to work with your dearest Frau Angelia.

Light: ...No, please don't say that.

K: Oh, come off it. I'm not interested in the business of some teenage kid still wet behind his ears.

K: Now if you understand what you need to do, then scram. Can't you see I have guests?

Light: Oh...

Light looks back and finds that Chairwoman Ulrich and her two bodyguards have been standing there silently for what appears to be a long time.

At the sight of the poised woman, he bows lightly in the way of acknowledgement.

Ulrich gives him a nod to indicate that she doesn't mind the wait.

Light: In that case, I'll take my leave.

K: Good.

Light gives K a salute and takes off with the investigation report in hand.

He brushes past Ulrich but does not even bother to shoot her another glance.

Ulrich: ...So he is Uhrig's son?

K: And a rising star.

K: This is probably hard to believe, but he is J's protégé.

Ulrich waves her hand to send her bodyguards away.

The two security officers eye the rumpled-looking Stasi agent warily but still nod and back away.

When they are a safe distance away, Ulrich strolls up to K and stares out at the boats still toiling away in the river.

K: You came straight from an interview?

Ulrich: A politician fights her own battles, Schwaben.

K: The news from the last two days will keep the TV stations talking for the entire year.

K: Must've been tough cleaning up the whole mess.

Ulrich: Watch your tone, K.

Ulrich: We are still out in the open.

K: Apologies, I spoke out of turn.

Ulrich: ...But you're right, it hasn't been easy.

Ulrich: I had a lapse of judgment.

Ulrich sighs heavily.

Ulrich: It was obvious that Hopps was a member of the German Independence Party, but I didn't expect Morridow to have an even more complicated background... I thought they were sent by the same people.

Ulrich: It was largely my fault that the situation has taken a turn for the worse.

K: There's a saying in our world of the secret service, Madam Chairwoman.

K: Never regret your decisions after you've made them. One doesn't even get the chance to regret a decision if it is truly regrettable.

Ulrich: Are you lecturing me, Schwaben?

K: ...Sorry, I forgot my place.

K: What I mean to point out is that even though you never voiced your suspicions regarding those two beforehand, Angelia still figured it out.

Ulrich: I know.

Ulrich unclasps her hands and rubs them gently against each other.

Ulrich: When Angelia uprooted the Flora Institute, I could defend her.

Ulrich: It was Leone who forced her hand to begin with.

Ulrich: When she overstepped her authority at the orphanage, I could also quash the voices of objection.

Ulrich: Even the filthiest politicans I know understand that child-trafficking is a line that must not be crossed.

Ulrich: But what she did in the refugee settlement was completely out of line, K.

Ulrich: Those people in Berlin are like starving wolves eyeing a piece of juicy meat, and Angelia practically bared her own neck to their fangs.

Ulrich: This isn't an issue of whether I warned her beforehand or not, K.

Ulrich: Ange's actions would inevitably have consequences.

Ulrich: That's just who she is.

K: So...what are you worried about?

Ulrich: The people in Berlin have taken her, K.

Ulrich: And there's nothing I can do. I am out of my depth here.

K: You're right, they won't let go of Ange so easily.

K: I know their methods. They will shake her till she gives up the information they're after.

K: They won't stop until she succumbs.

Ulrich: From now on, she is on her own.

K: You say that, but you've still transferred J and Light to Berlin. You're still doing whatever you can to help her.

Ulrich: ...

K: ...What?

Ulrich looks up at K. Her face is largely unreadable, but the faint traces of apprehension does not escape K's experienced eyes.

Which is both surprising and puzzling to K—such a large reaction is a rather uncharacteristic display of weakness for someone like Ulrich.

Ulrich: ...K.

K: Yes?

Ulrich: I did not arrange any transfers.

K: Huh?

K is clearly not as good as masking his own emotions. His obvious shock has even drawn the attention of the two bodyguards, who have been watching them.

K: Then who was it?

K: They certainly aren't being dispatched on some ordinary mission... And the fact that they've chosen to send us means their aim is to help Ange.

Ulrich: That's right, this could be a good thing for Ange...so don't worry, K.

K: I'm not worried. Ange and I aren't THAT close.

K: I'm just a bit shocked that someone could bypass your authority and issue commands to high-ranking Stasi agents operating in Bremen—who could it be?

Ulrich: I have no idea.

Ulrich gazes down towards the river, where the tireless searchers are still looking for signs of a young woman in the icy water.

Ulrich: The stage has shifted, Schwaben.

Ulrich: ...I just hope we haven't fallen too far behind.

...

...

...

???: ...

A pungent metallic scent permeates the air in the confined space. Beads of sweat slide off a young woman's forehead and drip into the pool of blood on the floor, echoing briefly.

???: ...Are you alright?

Morridow: I'm fine.

???: I have never seen you punished so harshly... Father is furious.

Morridow: Failure deserves to be punished. This is our rule.

???: If you count as a failure, what does that make us...

Morridow: Only one person gets to decide who is a failure, Narciss.

Morridow: Watch your tongue.

Narciss: I understand...

Narciss: So who are we supposed to kill this time?

Morridow: ...

Morridow gets to her feet laboriously.

Morridow: It won't be so simple, Narciss.

Morridow: This time, we may have to make some sacrifices.

Narciss: ...Really?

Morridow: If Father orders you to kill me, Narciss...

Morridow: Will you hesitate?

Narciss: No, I will do it gladly.

Morridow: Very good... I know I can count on you.

Morridow tucks a wet strand of hair behind her ear and gazes at the girl leaning in. She strokes her gently on the cheek.

Morridow: Make it clean.

Narciss: ...Okay.

...
Part 2: An Arrow in Flight I

2

"Here, you must rid yourself of any hesitation. Fear gets you nowhere."

Ange: ...12?

Ange: ...Where am I?

Her head is so sluggish it feels like it had cement poured in.

Even reaching for a thought sends jabs of sharp pain through her head, as if her very brain is being shredded.

Angelia calls out to her second-in-command out of reflex in the dark, but naturally, she receives no response.

Ange: Ugh...!

A sudden noise pierces her ear drums like a sharp needle.

The ceaseless ringing in her ears transports her back to that fateful day buried deep in her memory.

She no longer remembers.

How many times she has recalled the events of that day.

Voice of a Child: Mama!!

Voice of a Child: (Sobs) I want Papa...

Bang!

Ange: ...

...

...She remembers now.

This isn't the Neo-Soviet Union.

Smack!

Splash!

Ange: (Pants)

Splash!

(Gurgling)

Ange's violent writhing sends water splashing out of the bucket, flooding the floor of the interrogation room.

Her two arms are tied to separate posts—her bionic arm restrained by a steel chain, her other arm by a rough piece of rope, which scrapes against the skin on her wrist every time she struggles.

The flax-colored rope is soaked in crimson, and when the blood dries, it turns black.

Ange: Pah!

Ange: (Pants)

...Did she just lose consciousness briefly?

Not only did she pass out, she even recalled past events.

How humiliating.

Interrogator A: I'm asking you again, Angelia!

The coarse man pulls Ange's head out of the bucket of water by the hair for the fourth time and bellows into her ear.

Interrogator A: Why have you come to Germany?!

Ange: Fuck you...

Ange spits viciously.

Interrogator A: You bitch!

(Gurgles)

Ange's face is shoved once again into the water.

Interrogator B: Enough.

Ange: (Gasps)

The other interrogator interjects, giving Ange a brief moment of respite.

But even so, it still feels to Ange that her bones are on the verge of falling apart.

A lean man walks up to her and squats down. In his hands are a small knife and a sharpening steel, which he rubs against each other rhythmically as he approaches. The sound of scraping metal sends chills down Ange's spine.

Her fringe is soaking wet and sticking to her forehead, but it does not obscure her vision.

Interrogator B: Are you still with us? What's your name?

Ange: Elizaveta Schwarzkopf.

Interrogator B: ...Why have you come to Germany?

Ange: To travel. And to climb the Reichstag Building—that's one of the top three things all Soviets want to do, don't you know?

Interrogator A: Angelia!

Clang!

A hard rod knocks Ange in the back of her neck. Her vision darkens for a second. She almost passed out again.

Interrogator B: Caffrey! I'm asking her questions!

Interrogator A: But...

The burly man looks a bit disgruntled, but he still puts away his rod reluctantly.

Ange: (Pants)

Interrogator B: Look, Frau Ange.

Interrogator B: I know you are very well-trained, but your lack of cooperation does neither of us any good.

The man leans in close until his savage face is mere inches away from Ange.

His voice is more coarse and gravelly than before.

Ange glances at the scars on his face and the knife in his hand.

Ange: Is this how the Stasi treat their guests?

Interrogator B: We always show great hospitality to our guests, but we also show no mercy to our enemies.

He rests the blade against Ange's cheek and leans in even closer.

Interrogator B: You started a large-scale riot on German territory.

Interrogator B: And you ruthlessly murdered a public servant working for the German government.

Ange: For the last time... Morridow is a Paradeus spy.

Interrogator B: Nobody can verify that, Angelia.

Interrogator B: From our point of view, after a government worker boarded a plane with you...

Interrogator B: She was thrown out of the aircraft with no protective measures. Her fate is still unknown.

Interrogator B: This is murder, Angelia.

Interrogator B: You murdered Morridow.

Ange: ...Bullshit.

Ange: You're making up this load of crap just so you can hold me captive?

Ange: You really need to sort out your priorities, you know?

Seemingly unaware of the blade pressed against her pale, emaciated face, Ange's eyes are still sharp like a hawk's.

Ange: You don't actually give a damn about one stupid secretary. You're just looking for an excuse to detain me, and now you finally have it.

Interrogator B: ...

The man taps the knife against Ange's face and gestures to the burly man behind her.

Interrogator A: No one asked your opinion!

Smack!

Another excruciating blow lands on Ange's back.

Ange: (Wheezes)

The blow catches Ange by surprise and she starts coughing violently. Thick globs of blood drip from her lips into the bucket, infusing the dirty water.

...Was the water this dirty to begin with or did the filth actually come from her?

She can't remember. She has even lost track of how long she's been here.

Interrogator B: You're one to speak your mind, and so am I.

The man narrows his eyes.

Interrogator B: Tell me, Angelia.

Interrogator B: What did you see on the lower levels of the submarine base?

Interrogator B: Tell me...and I'll guarantee your safety.

Ange: Ha...haha...hahahaha.

Now that the man has finally asked the million-dollar question, Ange lowers her head and starts snickering.

Interrogator A: What's so funny, bitch?!

Ange: (Coughs) Hahaha.

Ange: This. I had to watch Morridow slip out of my fingers for this.

Ange: For your filthy and pointless power struggle!

Ange: Go to hell, fuckers!

Ptooey!

Ange spits a mouthful of blood on the man's face.

Interrogator B: ...

The man's face instantly contorts with rage. He tosses the sharpening steel into the bucket.

Interrogator B: You'd better pray this won't leave any scars.

Ange: I. Have. A. Whole. Collection.

Slam!

Voice of a Woman: Stop right there. That's quite enough.

The heavy metal door opens a crack, letting in slivers of light into this dark room.

The man stops immediately. The tip of the blade pierces the skin on Ange's left cheek, a drop of blood seeps through and rolls down.

Interrogator B: ...

The woman who came in abruptly waves wordlessly at the interrogators.

The two men, who were boiling with rage just seconds ago, collect themselves right away, give her a curt nod, and stand aside.

Two men in suits walk up from behind the woman and untie Ange's restraints. They hoist her up like ragdoll and drag her roughly towards the door.

Ange: ...What do you want with me?

Nobody answers her. She has no choice but to let the two men take her out of the room.

Before she can get a good look at her surroundings, a sack goes over her head.

...

Thud!

Ange is shoved brusquely from behind and she crashes onto the floor like a sandbag. A door closes behind her.

They moved her somewhere else?

She can't see a thing. Her recently untied hands are now cuffed again. She struggles to roll onto her back and finally manages to sit up. She tries to remove the sack over her head.

???: Ange?

While Ange is still writhing around, a hand stretches out and pulls the sack off her head.

An anxious AN-94 comes into view.

Ange: ...94?

AN-94: Ange, you are very badly injured.

AN-94 picks up Ange with practiced ease and puts her down gently on the sofa.

Only then does Ange notice she has been moved into an ordinary room. It is clean and even furnished—at least it certainly doesn't look like an interrogation chamber.

Ange: I'm fine... Where are the others?

AN-94: I don't know. We've been locked up separately the whole time. I only got brought here minutes ago.

Ange: (Hisses)

Before they can say more, the door opens again.

AK-12: Have you considered getting a pair of bionic limbs yourself?

AN-94: 12!

AK-12: 94? ...Ange!

AK-12 smirk vanishes the moment she sees Ange.

AK-12: What the hell have you done to her...you bastards?!

She spins around, ready to unleash her wrath on whoever brought her here, only to find that the door is shut once again.

Ange: 12!

Ange: ...Calm down.

Ange raises her voice to stop AK-12 but the effort ends up tearing a wound open. She collapses into another coughing bout.

AK-12: Take it easy, Ange. You look like hell.

AN-94: We have to get out of here. Ange needs medical treatment.

AK-12: You're right, but I have a feeling this isn't over yet. There must be a reason why they're suddenly putting us back together.

The door opens a third time, revealing a hulking figure.

Security Guard: ...G-Get in!

AK-15: ...

AK-15 enters the room in silence, followed by the wily RPK-16.

RPK-16: Oh wow, the whole gang is here. Are we taking one last family photo before facing the firing squad?

AN-94: Firing squad?

Ange: ...You think we're about to be executed in secret?

RPK-16: Why else would they suddenly bring us all together?

AK-12: Well, they can suck it. 15, did you pass by any armories on your way here?

AK-15: ...No, but I saw a few armed guards on patrol.

AK-12: Good enough. We'll each get ourselves a gun and shoot our way out of here.

AK-12: You're in charge of carrying Ange. It's not like you can be of much use anyway.

RPK-16: Ouch, how mean.

Ange: Enough.

Ange sits up on the sofa.

Ange: ...I haven't told them anything. Even if they're going to execute us, it won't be any time soon.

Ange: Not to mention how their attitude changed so abruptly.

Ange: I'm guessing there's been some unexpected development.

AK-12: Unexpected development?

Before Ange can answer, the door opens again.

Female Official: ...

The woman that brought Ange out of the interrogation chamber appears before her once again.

Ange: What now?

Female Official: You may leave. We have arranged temporary accommodation for you.

Female Official: From now on, Angelia, you may not leave Berlin.

Female Official: You must stay at your designated accommodation and observe curfew rules.

Female Official: Effective until our investigation concludes.

Ange: So I'm being placed under house arrest.

Ange: Is that really necessary?

Female Official: You may go.

Female Official: Now. This instant.

Not bothering to answer even a single question, the female official seems extremely impatient. It's almost as if she can't wait to be rid of them.

Ange exchanges puzzled looks with her Dolls, but before she can say anything, they are all escorted out of the room by a few gruff security guards.

...
Part 3: An Arrow in Flight II

3

Ministry for State Security, Berlin.

After exiting the building, Ange looks up at the blue sky that she so sorely missed.

Ange: And here I thought nowhere is as cold as the Soviet Union's administrative complex.

Ange: I envy those who complain about blinding sunshine.

AK-12: What's the meaning of this?

AK-12 is still seething about their treatment.

AK-12: A 48-hour interrogation experience?

AK-12: Not even an extra minute?

AK-12: Can I extend my session?

Even their weapons have been returned. Ange caresses her pistol and fights the sudden urge to charge back inside and shoot everyone.

AN-94: But isn't it good that we're released?

Ange: Of course it's good, but I can't help but wonder—why?

Ange looks up at the long flight of stairs before her thoughtfully.

RPK-16 and AK-15, who were the first to leave the building, are now sitting at the bottom of the staircase.

RPK-16 is tapping away at the laptop computer she is balancing on her knees. A cable joins the two Dolls by the neck.

Ange: Were you all locked up in separate cells?

Ange shuffles down the stairs slowly and sits down next to her subordinates.

AK-15: ...

RPK-16: Neural cloud...okay.

RPK-16: Fire-control core...okay.

RPK-16: Sorry, what was that again?

AN-94: Yes, I was held inside an electronically-sealed room.

AN-94: But they didn't do anything to me.

AK-12: Apparently, they were worried that the four of us would be violent in our resistance.

AK-12: Which is ridiculous—if we had wanted to raise hell, it would make no difference whether we were locked together or separately.

Ange: How long was I in there? Two days?

RPK-16: It's been more than two days since we got off the plane.

RPK-16: While we were held captive, they wouldn't let us see anyone, nor were we allowed visitors.

RPK-16: All our equipment and weapons were also confiscated.

RPK-16: I honestly thought we would only walk out of there to have our neural clouds fried.

AK-12: What do you make of this, Ange?

Ange: The detention was uncharacteristically short. It should've lasted at least another week.

Ange: They obviously have no qualms about torture, but they ended up releasing me before they could beat the information out of me. That's very odd.

AK-12: True, we shouldn't count on the Germans suddenly developing a conscience.

Ange: Someone pulled some strings behind the scenes.

Ange: Our release definitely wasn't a coincidence.

AN-94: Could it be Chairwoman Ulrich?

Ange: If Ulrich had that much power, we wouldn't have ended up in this sticky situation in the very first place.

Ange: ...48 hours is more than enough for Morridow to make it across the border into the Soviet Union.

AK-15: I heard that Mr. K has taken over the investigation.

AK-15 suddenly opens her eyes and joins the conversation. RPK-16 deftly unplugs the cable from her neck.

RPK-16: Take a seat, Captain.

AK-12: No thanks, I can run a diagnostic on my own.

RPK-16: We've been held for two whole days. If they messed around with our hardware or software, you'd want to find out now, so stop being a sulky child.

RPK-16: You do realize that as things stand, there's no way we can find even cheap replacements for our bodies, right?

AK-12: ...

AK-12 sits down grumpily at the spot previously occupied by AK-15.

Ange: K took over... I have nothing against him.

Ange: But they might as well have lined the streets and given Morridow a warm send-off across the border.

AK-15: We wouldn't catch her in time even if we set off now.

Ange: I know. Not to mention that these Krauts are restricting my movements.

Ange rests her hands on her knees and slowly scans the empty streets around her.

Who knows how many hidden pairs of eyes are currently observing the group having a conversation on the stairs.

Ange: They had to keep a low profile even though they're on their home turf...

Ange: Looks like whoever helped us is of considerable status and authority.

RPK-16: All this speculation does us no good. Even without all these obstacles, we still need time to rest.

RPK-16: Willpower is all that's keeping Miss Ange on her feet in her present condition.

RPK-16: You're in no state to continue our investigation, are you?

RPK-16 leans towards Ange affectionately and takes a long, deliberate look at her quivering legs.

AK-12 forcefully yanks the cable connecting her to RPK-16 and jerks her back.

AK-12: I'm with her on this one, Ange.

AK-12: You can play tough all you want in front of others, but you sound like you want to get back to work in your current state.

AK-12: Not only is that reckless, it's downright stupid.

Ange: ...We've already wasted too much time.

Ange glares at her knees and growls defiantly.

AK-12: Then what difference does a few more hours make?

AK-12: You said it yourself—you thought they were going to keep you for at least a week.

AK-12: But it's only been 48 hours—plus a few more hours of sleep.

AK-12: We're actually ahead of schedule.

Ange: ...Fine.

Ange: But before I rest...

Ange: Nobody objects to some light workout, hm?

Ange gives her thighs a smack and slowly stands up.

RPK-16 unplugs the cable and gestures to AK-12 that the diagnostic is complete. She jokes jovially as she packs away her equipment.

RPK-16: My, so Ange likes toying with young men.

She looks around thoughtfully and makes a face in the direction that Ange was squinting at.

Ange: Don't put it so weirdly.

AK-15: ...Two on the left, three on the right.

AK-15: About eight in the building behind us.

AK-15: What should we do with them?

Ange: Let's give them a lesson and teach them to show some respect to veterans.

Ange: Give these Krauts hell.

AK-12: Yes, ma'am.
Part 4: Torricelli's Trumpet I

4

The next day, in an apartment.

The warm sunshine of late summer seeps through the window and shines upon the wooden floorboards, filling the entire room with gentle light.

It only takes half a second for Ange to shake off her drowsiness and reach for the pistol she has hidden underneath her pillow.

She distinctly remembers closing the curtains before going to sleep.

Ange: ...

AK-12: Good morning, Ange.

When she opens her eyes, she sees AK-12 sitting on a wooden chair brought in from some other room, casually sipping a cup of coffee.

Ange: ...Get me a cup as well.

Ange puts down her gun and slowly sits up.

Expecting to heal overnight is a bit unrealistic...but getting some sleep is enough for her.

AK-12: It's on your bedside table. I also got you some blueberry cookies.

AK-12: You look like you could use some carbs and vitamins.

Ange scratches her head and looks toward the bedside table.

The coffee and cookies are sitting there waiting for her... Surprisingly, she didn't notice the aroma until now.

The warm beverage with its bitter sweetness washes away the last trace of grogginess in her head.

This girl isn't a good cook in any sense, but she always knows exactly what she needs.

Ange: ...The temperature is just right.

AK-12: Thanks.

Ange: I told you not to run bio-scans on me.

AK-12: I just gave you a quick checkup. You needed medical treatment.

AK-12: If I hadn't scanned you, how would I know when you would wake up?

Ange: ...Tsk.

The blueberry cookies have just the right amount of tanginess.

AK-12: How do you feel?

Ange: Didn't you just scan me?

AK-12: I'm asking about how you're feeling.

Ange: It hurts where it should.

Ange: But that's a good sign—it means I'm getting better.

AK-12: The scan result says as much.

AK-12: If it were anybody else, I'd recommend staying in bed for another week, but I'm guessing you're already raring to go.

Ange: What's the situation out there?

AK-12: What can I say? It's exactly what you'd expect in the very heart of Germany.

AK-12: This apartment is much better equipped than the one we were given in Bremen—in terms of both living condition and surveillance.

AK-12: RPK alone has discovered enough bugs and hidden cameras to open a store.

Ange gets out of bed and walks around AK-12 to the window. She peers outside and studies the view.

They are on the eighth floor. The Stasi have put them somewhere high up, probably so that they can keep a better eye on them.

AK-12: While you were resting, RPK and I have gathered some information on what happened while we were detained.

Ange: How are things over in Bremen?

AK-12: As you expected, K let Morridow escape.

Ange: ...Tsk.

Ange: Nevermind. It would be very difficult to capture her under such circumstances.

Ange: Even I underestimated her combat capability.

Their apartment block is the tallest building in the area, but Ange can still spot the flashing specks of light from the building across the street.

Ange: Is that the Stasi or someone else?

AK-12: Hard to say, but most of the Stasi agents would be in this building.

AK-12: It may well be someone else if they're monitoring us from across the street.

Ange shakes her head and closes the curtains.

AK-12: Oh, and it's not all bad news.

AK-12: They found this when they searched Morridow's apartment.

AK-12 produces a document.

The document does not contain much information, and there is just a single photograph.

Ange turns around and looks at the photo on the table. A photo of a large mansion.

Ange: ...I know this house.

AK-12: Looks familiar, doesn't it?

Ange: You got the location?

AK-12: Not yet, RPK is on it.

AK-12: But even if we find it, these Germans won't let you wander around.

Ange: How many people are watching us right now?

AK-12: Are you sure you want to know? Don't say I didn't warn you, but it's even worse than in Bremen.

AK-12: Also, these people aren't friendly at all. I doubt we'd be getting any burger deliveries from them.

Ange: Is there any way we can lose them?

Ange: I don't have time to waste on them.

AK-12: Easier said than done. We don't have Stasi agents giving us a hand this time. Quite the contrary, they are mobilizing en masse just to monitor our movements.

AK-12: This is their home turf, it will be challenging to slip away from right under their nose, to say the least.

Ange: ...Tsk.

Ange rubs her temples.

Ange: Since they're going to such great lengths to keep tabs on me, I'll just stay here.

Ange: Any idea who it was that set us free?

AK-12: I was just about to get to that.

AK-12: RPK and I spent the whole night trying to figure that out, but we haven't got much to work with.

AK-12: The Germans aren't happy at all that we've been let out and are watching our every move.

Ange: Humph...

Ange: So basically, you haven't learned anything?

AK-12: That's not entirely true. At the very least, we learned more about the current situation.

AK-12: By the looks of it, Berlin already has its hands full with its own problems.

Ange: What do you mean?

AK-12: Look at this.

AK-12 picks up the remote control and turns on the television in the room.

The morning news happens to be on at the moment, and a fierce-looking woman appears in front of the camera.

???: Good morning, Shadowless reporting here on the frontlines.

???: We are currently on the eastern riverfront, where the mass demonstration is escalating.

???: Please take a look.

The scene shows a rambunctious group of people shouting and displaying banners written in German. They all have the same symbol painted on their faces.

The armed anti-riot police force hovers some distance away hesitantly. Finding strength in numbers, the protesters block off the roads and do not back down even in the face of public authority.

Shadowless: The protesters are getting louder and louder. Their representative claims that this is a rightful protest against the government's inaction.

Shadowless: According to certain sources, this could be related to the obstructions encountered by the Idunn Formulation Type-III, an ELID serum developed by Galatea Corporation...

Ange takes a sip of coffee before putting down her cup and picking up the document from the table.

Apart from the photo of the mansion, it mentions some of Morridow's personal information. Ange did not expect any of it to be particularly useful, so she isn't disappointed.

Ange: What's the deal with these people?

AK-12: There have been a large number of incidents in Berlin in the past three months.

AK-12: They've had multiple riots, bombings and other kinds of insurgence. Due to the difficulty in investigating and the sheer number of cases, the Berlin police is gradually losing control over the situation.

AK-12: And in the last month, these disturbances have started to affect the daily life of ordinary citizens.

AK-12: It probably triggered some deep-seated malcontent in the people, and large-scale demonstrations broke out in the city.

Ange: Demonstrations? They're happening right now?

AK-12: That's right—they're taking place this very moment. The government district is still able to maintain the illusion that all is well, but it's utter chaos in the Old Town district.

AK-12: As you can see on TV.

Ange watches the real-time footage on the television with a frown. It's obvious that these people didn't take to the streets on a whim. Their anger must have built up over a long period of time.

For some reason, she feels a surge of unease, but she can't quite put a finger on what is bothering her.

Still mulling over this, Ange stretches out her arm to put the document back onto the table.

Clatter.

The file falls onto the floor, making a loud noise.

AK-12: Ange?!

Ange: ...

Ange stares dubiously at her left hand. She gingerly curls her fingers into a fist.

AK-12's eyes widen.

Ange: It's been a while since I last had it serviced.

Ange: Probably just some malfunctioning parts.

AK-12: ...Should I run a more detailed scan on it?

Ange: Don't bother. There are neither doctors nor suitable parts.

Ange: If I let the Stasi touch it, god knows what kind of malware they'd plant in there.

AK-12: Right... Then let's just hope you won't suddenly drop your gun when facing off some bad guy.

Ange: I shoot with my right hand, 12.

Knock knock.

Ange: Come in.

RPK-16: Good morning, Ange. Did you sleep well?

RPK-16 opens the door and enters jauntily. She immediately zeros in on AK-12, who's sitting in front of the window.

RPK-16: You look quite well-rested?

Ange: Cut the crap. What is it?

RPK-16: It's about the good samaritan who helped us.

RPK-16: AK-12 and I spent the whole night trying to identify them in vain, but things seem to have changed.

Ange: Oh?

RPK-16: I just received a message via my intranet.

RPK-16: The message completely bypassed my firewalls. I only noticed it when it came through.

RPK-16: I've tried, but I couldn't trace it.

AK-12: Not even you?

RPK-16: Not even me.

Ange: What does it say?

RPK-16: The subject is a Bible verse number.

RPK-16: "John 8.12".

Ange: "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."

Ange: John, Chapter 8 Verse 12.

Ange: ...How pretentious.

AK-12: And revolting. It's probably a stupid question, but does this remind you of anyone in particular?

Ange: Do I look like I know someone so obnoxious?

RPK-16: The message itself reads...

RPK-16: "Dear Ms. Anna Viktorovna Tsoi,

RPK-16: "I hope you will forgive me for meddling, but I deeply regret what happened in Bremen and the bad decisions the Stasi has made due to internal strife.

RPK-16: "There are things I wish to discuss with you concerning Paradeus, please meet me after lunch.

RPK-16: P.S. I hope you find the apartment satisfactory." ...Then there's an address. It looks like a bar in the Old Town.

RPK-16: A bar called "Athena's Owl".

AK-12: I'm getting a mop.

Ange: A mop? For what?

AK-12: For cleaning up my puke.

RPK-16: Will you go to the meeting?

Ange: To be honest, I don't want to—not one bit.

Ange: Do you know the three types of people that I hate the most?

RPK-16: People like AK-12 and people like me?

Ange: People with no conviction, pretentious pricks...

RPK-16: And what's the last type?

Ange: William.

Ange downs the rest of her coffee, pops a cookie into her mouth, and throws on her coat.

Ange: But right now, I don't really have a choice. At the end of the day, they did save me.

Ange: I should at least hear them out.

RPK-16: Alrighty~ Let me get 94 and 15.

Ange: But before that...

...

Stasi Agent A: ...The targets have left the building.

Stasi Agent A: They're heading northeast.

Stasi Agent B: Copy that.

Stasi Agent B: Five targets confirmed.

Stasi Agent B: It's Angelia and her Dolls.

???: Those are members of the Wolf Pack, top-of-the-line Tactical Dolls developed by Soviet Statesec.

???: Squad B, bring along your precise visual gear and stow away your weapons.

Stasi Agent B: Roger.

???: Frau Angelia is highly experienced. Do not lock horns with her.

???: If you have difficulty keeping up with her, report her final coordinates before you lose her.

???: Another squad will take over from there.

Stasi Agent A: Understood.

???: ...As locals, we know the terrain and the traffic. This is our greatest advantage.

???: Eat her alive. It's time to show what the Stasi are made of.

Stasi Agents A & B: Yes, sir!

...
Part 5: Torricelli's Trumpet II

5

...

This isn't the first time Ange has visited Berlin. The last time she was here, the now abandoned quarantine wall was still functional.

The river runs through the city, separating the city center and the Old Town district. Soon after Ange goes through the Brandenburg Gate, she arrives at Alt-Berlin.

It's already past noon, but the demonstration is not over yet. In fact, it has even more momentum than shown on TV.

Ange: Looks like people face the same problems no matter which country they live in.

AK-12: I've always thought Germans are stoic.

AK-12: Turns out they are still very vocal about their dissatisfaction when they are pushed too far.

Ange: That stereotype should've been deconstructed the moment you met J.

AN-94: Why are they protesting?

Ange: Because of the economy, the environment, their livelihood... It's always the same reasons.

Ange: If society doesn't make any fundamental changes, these problems will never go away.

RPK-16: I just picked up an interesting buzzword.

RPK-16: Have you heard about the anti-Collapse serum?

Ange: Anti-Collapse serum?

RPK-16: A product of Galatea and apparently the cure to ELID.

Ange: Never heard of it. But a bunch of vaccines that claim to be the answer to ELID are introduced to the market every year.

Ange: Then the pharma companies flounder and drown under financial difficulties... No, if the environmental problems are not addressed, humankind will always be plagued by ELID.

RPK-16: You're absolutely right. So long as people are still getting infected, you will never produce enough drugs to cure them all.

RPK-16: Humans really do have a knack for doing pointless things.

Ange: That's none of your concern. Right now, we have more pressing issues.

Standing on the riverbank, Ange gazes at the bridge that the police has sealed off.

On the other side of the river, countless protesters have gathered, waving their banners and chanting their slogans. To passers-by who have no intention of joining in, their presence is merely an inconvenience that's causing a traffic jam.

Ange: How are our tag-alongs?

AK-12: Still very much with us. These people are not on the same league as those from yesterday.

AK-12: The person in command here isn't to be taken lightly.

AK-15: This is very tricky.

Since the moment they left the apartment, Ange has been trying to shake off the agents that are following them.

But even now, she can still feel their eyes boring holes into her back. She was expecting it, but she is nonetheless rather surprised by the level of their skills.

Ange: We're almost there.

Ange: I can't lead them straight to the meeting place. You know what I mean?

AK-12: It'd be a shame if you miss your booking and lose your table at the bar.

Ange: I phoned to book a table as an answer to their invitation.

Ange: If I show up late because I get tied down, it'll be difficult to gain the upper hand in the negotiations.

AK-12 takes off her sunglasses.

AK-12: In that case, let's make use of these rowdy folks.

AK-12: We'll teach our creepy stalkers to fear us Soviet agents.

Part 6: Torricelli's Trumpet III

6

Protesters: The government must address our demands immediately!

Protesters: Bureaucrats who don't give a damn about the people's lives are fascists!

Protesters: Listen to the people!

...

Stasi Agent A: Angelia is crossing the bridge.

???: I knew it. Thank you, your job here is done.

???: Squads C and D, prepare to take over.

Stasi Agent C: Understood.

Stasi Agent D: Understood.

???: Frau Angelia is very skilled at making use of crowds and traffic in reverse-tracking. Pay attention to your lines of sight and blind spots when working with other squads.

???: Also, watch out for their attacks. Even Frau Angelia herself is an exceptional fighter.

???: Not to mention the Dolls.

Stasi Agent C: Angelia has crossed the street. She is now turning into Beckestraße.

???: What about the crowd's movements?

Stasi Agent D: The procession is heading towards Weirlanke in the east.

???: Squads E and F, disperse the crowd.

???: Do not let the target distract you.

Stasi Agent B: Copy that.

Stasi Agent B: The Berlin Police is in the area. Should we notify them?

???: Untrained personnel will only make things more difficult for us. Leave them out of this.

???: It'll be a tough battle once they blend into the demonstrating procession.

???: I will keep an eye on things from a high vantage point. Don't get yourselves killed.

Stasi Agent C&D&E&F: Yes, sir!

???: ...

On top of a tall building, the youth, who is observing the milling crowd from above, turns off his communicator and frowns.

Why is there a large-scale demonstration today of all days?

What is Angelia doing here?

Light: Something just doesn't feel right...

Light: Am I just imagining things?

BOOM!

Light: !

While Light is muttering to himself...

An explosion occurs at the very front of the procession.

...

After pushing her way through the crowd that has gathered at the bridge, Ange soon realizes that there is another rallying crowd in the district.

In order to spread their message far and wide and gain more influence, the protesters keep moving tirelessly.

For Ange, this is naturally a great opportunity—the crowd obstructs her enemies' view; she can dart through the stream of people, circle back and take out her enemies in one fell swoop.

Ange is usually an expert in shaking off her pursuers.

But today, things are not that simple.

Ange: Tsk!

No matter where she goes, these people stick to her like glue, as though she has a GPS tracker on her.

Even when she wants to make a move, she can never completely escape her enemies' line-of-sight—not even for a second.

In such a tightly-packed crowd, she has neither the time nor the space to have a boxing match with them.

What's even worse...

Ange: 12! 94!

AK-12: Ange! Ange, where are you?!

Ange: I'm... Dammit!

How can she tell where she is?

For some reason, a commotion seems to have broken out at the front of the procession, and the demonstration comes to a halt at this block.

The people in the front and the back cannot communicate with each other. The ones in the back try to push forward while the ones in the front are stuck, and chaos ensues.

Under these conditions, even powerful T-Dolls are utterly helpless.

Ange has been separated from DEFY for over five minutes. The Dolls can locate each other by their signals, but it has already occurred to Ange that that isn't the problem.

New protesters keep pouring in from all directions. Even AK-15 cannot make her way through all that people to Ange.

She must think of something fast.

Protester A: Hey, this guy is a cop!

Stasi Agent E: ...!!

Protester B: Scheiße! We have a traitor in our midst!

Stasi Agent : H...Hold on! I'm...!

The sudden accusation causes the already riled crowd to erupt. The protesters direct all their anger towards their target—it doesn't even matter if he is actually a traitor or not.

Ange: ...!

Meanwhile, Ange gets dragged along by someone in a different direction.

Ange: Don't touch me!

Male Voice: Ow!

The man lets out a yelp of pain as his shoulder gets dislocated, but she is still being dragged away. Ange immediately realizes what's going on.

It's isn't just one or two people—everyone around her is deliberately trying to move her in a specific direction.

Ange: You've got to be kidding me...!

Her poorly maintained bionic arm breaks down at this critical moment. Ange struggles in vain and can only let herself drift along helplessly like a lily pad on a pond.

Ange: Get off me! ...Oof.

Whoosh.

One last shove ejects Ange from the crowd. She stumbles a few steps and almost trips over the raised sidewalk.

None of the people who pushed her come after her. The protesters are still bellowing in anger without a glance towards her.

Standing on the sidewalk and steadying herself, Ange finally moves her finger away from the trigger of her pistol... She was this close to going on a killing spree.

It is an immense relief to finally be free of the crowd. She swears never to resort to this method ever again.

Ange: ...

Those people led her here on purpose.

They even got rid of her pursuers for her.

Ange puts her pistol back into its holster and takes a look around, but she sees nothing unusual.

Just she is about to turn away, her heart skips a beat.

Ange: ...I'm here?

"Athena's Owl".

The bar stated in the address is right in front of her.

Its entrance awaits quietly next to the bustling crowd, its neon sign flashing even during the day.

With emotions still running high, nobody is looking this way or paying any attention to Ange or what she is about to do.

By the bar entrance, a raggedy beggar is sitting on the stairs.

Her indifferent eyes follow Ange closely below her hood.

Ange has also noticed her. She wonders if she drew the her attention when she was putting away her gun.

Beggar: ...

Beggar: ...Angelia?

Ange: !

The beggar calls out Ange's name softly. Upon seeing her reaction, she nods.

Beggar: Salvation lies within.

The beggar lifts her walking stick and taps the door of the bar with it.

Then she closes her eyes and leans back against the door frame, seemingly fast asleep again.

Ange: ...Inside the bar?

Ange: Is this some sort of dystopian metaphor?

Should I wait for DEFY or go in on my own?

Ange: ...

After a short moment of hesitation, Ange decides to head inside.

Ange: I think I know who you are.

She knocks on the door softly. After another glance at the slumbering beggar, she takes a deep breath and pushes the door open.

Ring.

A bell jingles brightly to announce Ange's arrival.

Customer A: Barkeep, another Screwdriver!

Customer B: Hey! Did you just hide the menu?

The heavy wooden door has been keeping all the noise in the bar from spilling into the streets. Only when Ange pushes open the door does she notice how boisterous it is in this small space.

The piano playing is drowned out by conversations. She stops in front of the door and scans the interior of the establishment... Such a lawless, chaotic place does make for the perfect meetup place.

Ange: ...

Perhaps because the bar is so isolated from the outside world, nobody seems to have noticed Ange's entrance.

Like other such establishments in the Old Town district, this place is filled with people from the lower stratas of Berlin's society—and the sound of their hollering and clinking wine glasses.

No one but Ange herself hears her footsteps. It's only natural in such a noisy environment.

She strolls unobtrusively on the old floorboards and keeps herself ready to draw her firearm within half a second.

Flippant Man/Speaker>||AVG_20Winter_Whistle

At the counter, a nefarious-looking scoundrel whistles at a bar girl next to Ange.

He doesn't seem to have seen Ange at all. He laughs, flashing his mouthful of yellow teeth, and drains the beer in his stein in one go.

Ange takes a glance at him and quickly retracts her gaze.

She does not want to get into any trouble before the meeting.

The man seems to have the same idea. Still ignoring Ange as if he hadn't seen her, he lifts his stein and beckons for the bar girl to refill it.

He never even glances at Ange the whole time.

Not just him.

Everyone in the bar acts as if she was invisible.

Nobody greets her or asks if she'd like to order something. People don't even look at her.

If someone happens to look in her direction, their gaze just glides over her as though she was nothing but air.

Ange: This is it...

Angelia is a special agent so she can sniff out danger from miles away.

However, despite how bizarre this phenomenon is, oddly enough, she doesn't feel unnerved at all.

She collects herself for a moment before venturing deeper into the building.

Everything feels very natural around her—this is just your run-of-the-mill bar with tobacco, beer, poker cards... The atmosphere is fantastic. Ange would love to have a drink here on a day-off.

Ange: ...Tsk.

...In such an ordinary place, Ange's presence is the only anomaly.

Which is why she knows instantly that she has found her target when she notices another "anomaly".

Most bars put out more tables and seats on the dance floor during daytime to accommodate more customers, and this place is no exception.

But right now, the dance floor filled with tables and chairs is completely deserted...

Except for the only occupied table right in the center.

A round table with two chairs.

A man is seated in one of them. He has his back to Ange, and the only bit of skin exposed is his hand on the arm rest.

Next to him, Ange can see a few bottles of very expensive wine on the table.

Just like with Ange, nobody is acknowledging this man's presence.

The space he's occupying might as well be a separate dimension that Ange alone can see.

???: Please have a seat, Angelia.

???: After the commotion outside, you must be tired.

A low and sonorous voice speaks from the chair all of a sudden. Even though Ange hasn't made a sound, he knows she's there—as if he had eyes on the back of his head.

Ange walks around him wordlessly and pulls out the other chair opposite him.

Ange: I've been playing out this scene in my head many times before I walk through the door.

Ange: I had a lot of guesses, but this isn't what I expected at all.

Ange: ...I don't believe I know you.

???: Not even all of my friends know me.

The middle-aged man with white sideburns sitting in the armchair cleans the lenses of his spectacles as he speaks.

His voice is deep and mellow, which matches the air he gives off.

Even if he hadn't spoken, Ange could have guessed he's a Brit.

He has all the qualities of a typical Englishman—resolute, gentlemanly, proud, distant...and pretentious as hell.

Ange studies him and remains silent.

The man takes his time pushing his glasses up his tall nose. A sharp glint flashes in his pale gray eyes as they focus on Ange.

Ange feels like a prey animal that's been spotted by a predator.

Ange: I suppose special agents should get used to speaking to people who don't reveal their name.

???: You've seen Berlin for yourself while you're on the way here.

???: I hope the discourteous welcome you received hasn't caused you to be prejudiced against this beautiful city.

Brushing off Ange's gibe, the man sitting straight as a ramrod places his interlaced fingers on his lap and smiles at her.

???: But Berlin must have made a much different impression compared to Bremen.

Ange: ...Indeed.

Ange purses her lips to hide her impatience. She puts an elbow on the table.

Ange: Bremen was bad enough.

???: Berlin is worse.

The man remarks offhandedly and directs his gaze towards the pianist performing a relaxing piece.

Ange: Is this why you've brought me here? For small talk?

???: You think this conversation is a waste of time; I beg to differ.

???: Angelia... We are constantly deluding ourselves into thinking that the world is getting back on track.

???: But the truth is staring us right in the face—there is still too much hidden darkness.

???: And where there is darkness, there is tragedy like what happened in Beslan.

???: If all things were bright and beautiful in the world...why would your parents suffer such a terrible fate?

Whoosh.

Ange leaps up from her chair.

Hush...

The moment she jumps to her feet, the bustling pub is engulfed in dead silence.

Ange is now certain that everyone around them—the people who have been deliberately ignoring them, is ready to take her down any second.

There isn't a single real customer in this pub.

???: ...

The man meets Ange's defiant gaze with his own sharp eyes.

He taps an empty glass in front of him with a spoon. The clear sound seems to have restarted the clock, and time once again starts flowing in the pub.

The "customers" go back to clinking glasses and sloshing beer. Everything returns to the same state as when Ange first came in.

The murderous intent that was directed at her vanishes without a trace.

Ange: Are you threatening me?

???: Please forgive me. You are a professionally trained agent while I'm just a defenseless old man.

???: They're simply concerned about my safety if it comes to an altercation.

Ange: That's not what your eyes suggest.

Ange: If I had wanted to do anything, you wouldn't have needed them to intervene.

???: Just sit down, Angelia.

???: Our conversation isn't over yet.

???: Don't forget... If I hadn't helped you, would you have left the Stasi's interrogation chamber?

Without answering Ange's question, the man fishes out a gold coin from his pocket. He gives his thumb a flick and the coin lands heavily in front of Ange.

Ange: ...

Ange watches the spinning coin as it gradually slows down and falls on its side. She looks up at the man again.

Ange: So it's you.

???: We are not enemies, Angelia.

???: On the contrary... We are the closest comrades-in-arms.

Ange: You and me? Ha... I doubt that.

Ange: Someone whose hands are even bloodier than mine is preaching to me about "all things bright and beautiful"? Bah.

???: We share a common goal, Ange.

???: I know you can't argue with that... Our methods may be different.

???: But our aspiration is the same—everything we do is for the sake of Rossartrism.

Ange: "Common destiny"... I've grown tired of this kind of rhetoric.

Ange: You may be able to fool the sheep in your country with that, but don't bother using it on me.

???: Have you never wondered why Zelinsky and Mikhail let you come to Germany?

Ange: ...

???: You are an outstanding agent, I'm sure you can discern the situation.

???: Think about it, Ange. Perhaps you were destined to work with me from the start, just as you were destined to walk into this pub.

???: You are cornered... Right now, you do not have a choice.

???: If you still refuse to trust me or your intuition...

???: You may pretend to have never met me and just walk out of here.

Ange: ...My intuition is telling me to pour a glass of whisky over your head.

Ange eyes the man before her, but he is still smiling benignly despite her provocation.

???: Sit down.

Ange keeps staring at him.

He shakes his head and pushes a glass towards her.

???: If you must, I recommend you do it with this glass.

Ange: ...

Ange takes a deep breath and finally sits back down.

???: This is what I like about you, Angelia.

???: You always read the situation.

Ange: Just cut to the chase. What leads do you have?

???: Let's return to the subject of Berlin... I believe you have seen what's happening out there.

Ange: The demonstration, you mean?

???: Berlin was nowhere this bad just a while ago. It has always been one of the most developed cities in the decontamination zone that has recovered quite well.

???: It is by no means a utopia, but you could rarely find such seeds of discord and instability here.

Ange: That's not what it looks like to me.

???: Seeds can ride the wind. They can also be carried in by beasts.

Ange: You want me to look into this?

???: Yes.

Ange: I have no time for such distractions.

Ange: You know why I've come to Germany.

???: Believe me, Angelia.

???: You will realize that our agendas are surprisingly similar.

Ange: ...This has something to do with William?

???: From what I know, this matter involves a conspiracy.

???: Following the incident in Bremen, Paradeus is planning to stage an even more elaborate terrorist attack in Berlin.

Ange: ...A terrorist attack?

Ange suddenly finds it difficult to breathe.

???: The White Faction's touch is evident in everything that has transpired in the last few months.

???: They have been inciting the people and sowing civil unrest.

???: I believe that when the time is right, they will make use of this unrest to cripple Berlin...

???: In the hope of preventing an outcome that they do not desire.

Ange: An outcome that they don't desire...?

Ange: This has something to do with you?

???: There will be an important meeting.

The man picks up his glass. He seems to have no intention of elaborating.

Ange: What's the source of this information?

???: The information is supplied by a private source with very high credibility.

???: However, that's the best I can do. The specific time, location, personnel, and other details of the attack...

???: ...are for you to investigate.

Ange: Is this all the help you're giving me?

???: I will also provide you with other forms of aid to the best of my ability.

???: Actually, I've already done it.

Ange: You persuaded the government to support me.

That is a statement, not a question.

Ange: So where should I begin?

???: To launch a terrorist attack in Berlin, explosives won't work.

???: It has to be with some kind of new weapon that cannot be detected.

???: A weapon...that we are both familiar with.

Ange: A familiar weapon... Pollen dirty bombs?

Ange: You want me to investigate Leone?

???: Just two days ago, she was escorted to Berlin in secret.

???: She is most definitely connected to this matter.

Ange: ...

Ange: ...I have a question.

???: What is it?

Ange: The mansion. You must know where it is. Tell me.

???: This is irrelevant.

Ange: You know I will not give in.

???: ...

The man lets out a sigh and shakes his head.

???: Once you have settled this business in Berlin, I will give you the location of the mansion.

Ange: Deal.

???: Learn to pick your battles, agent.

???: Sort out your priorities.

Ange: I am still a bit skeptical about what you said.

Ange: But I will look into it using my own method.

???: I don't care about your methods. I just want results.

Ange: So is that it?

Ange: You're washing your hands of this now that you've dumped it onto my lap?

???: I'm a busy man, agent. The battle I'm fighting in a place that you can't see is currently in a critical stage.

???: That said...

???: ...I have nevertheless prepared a little surprise for you.

Ange: Surprise?

???: An old friend of yours is en route with the support and intelligence you need.

???: You may have been going at it in different directions, but I assure you, you are both working towards the same goal.

???: Besides, I'm sure you will be very happy with this reunion.

Ange: ...Who is it?

???: The young commander working for Kryuger.

Ange: ...

Ange raises an eyebrow.

Ange: ...I should've known. It's backup that you summoned, after all.

???: I look forward to our fruitful cooperation.

Ange: You'd better not be wasting my time.

???: I will keep you up to speed if my private source reports any new updates.

???: Also, I suggest you leave through the back door... Things are a bit chaotic at the front entrance.

The man pushes the gold coin across the table to Ange. She glances at it and pockets it promptly.

Ange: ...Thanks.

???: ...

Knock knock.

The man taps the armrest on this chair again before getting up and heading towards another door without a word.

One minute after his departure.

The pub becomes as quiet and empty as a tomb.

...
Part 7: Athena's Owl

    7chevron_right

Ange pushes open the door and leaves the boisterous place behind.

Now that she knows the busy and lively scene was all a sham, she finds it rather sickening.

The gold coin weighs heavily in her pocket, signifying that everything that just happened was real.

...Now, she must hurry back to her apartment and discuss how to proceed with Task Force DEFY.

???: Frau Ange.

Ange: —!

While Ange is still deep in thought, someone calls her name softly from next to her.

Almost out of reflex, Ange pulls back and executes a kick.

Smack!

The kick produces such a loud noise Ange thinks she kicked a sandbag.

But the brief exchange is all it takes for her to take in her interceptor.

Light: One second, please.

Ange: Tsk.

Since her first kick didn't do the job, Ange delivers a second one without even a pause.

Light: Whoa!

The man seems to have expected Ange's attack and nimbly sidesteps it, causing her kick to miss a second time.

But Ange isn't fazed either.

Boom!

Her alloy fist smashes into the brick wall. If this punch had landed on a person, they would've been hospitalized for months.

Light: ...

Backed up against the wall with the small crater a mere inch away from his ear, the young man looks a little unnerved.

But Ange could see that he didn't make the slightest attempt to dodge her punch just now.

He knew⁠—with absolute certainty—that Ange would not hit him, so he did not even flinch.

Ange: Who are you?

The man rubs the arm he used to block Ange's first kick and looks at her apologetically.

Light: I saw that kick coming, but it was more powerful than I'd anticipated. You really are formidable.

He speaks in a perfectly even tone—neither humble nor haughty. Despite being at Ange's mercy, he shows no sign of panic.

Ange: Answer my question. Or the next punch will smash your brains out.

Light: You are not one to murder innocent people, Frau Angelia.

Ange: I can make an exception today.

Ange: And you are anything but innocent, not to mention rude.

Light: Pardon me... I haven't even introduced myself.

Light: As you can see, I am a Stasi agent.

Ange's brow furrows.

Only then does she notice that this man doesn't look older than 20.

Ange: What does the Stasi want with me now?

Ange: Don't tell me you want to send me back to lock me up for a few more days?

Light: No, that's not it.

Light: In fact...

Light blinks, the very image of innocence.

Light: I'm here to help you.

...

AK-12: Welcome back.

AN-94: Ange, are you alright?!

Ange catches sight of her two familiar subordinates the moment she enters the temporary ops room.

She frowns as she shifts her gaze from the Dolls to the man sitting in front of the monitors.

Ange: You've brought my subordinates here. What's the big idea, J?

J: Hey, don't give me that murderous look, eh?

J: It took a lot of work to pull these DEFY ladies out from among the rioting mob and gather them all, you know?

AK-15: We found this place ourselves.

J: Did you have to expose me straight away?!

Light: Thanks for the work, J.

The young man follows Ange into the room and greets J politely before turning to address the DEFY Dolls.

Light: As per our agreement, I have delivered Frau Angelia safely to you.

RPK-16: Well done. If you'd taken another minute, our leader would've clawed her way out through the roof.

Ange: 12, explain.

AK-12: There's nothing much to explain.

AK-12: When we got separated from you in the crowd, we immediately realized it would be extremely difficult to regroup.

AK-12: So we changed strategies and decided to track down those who were monitoring us instead.

Ange: That's how you found this place?

AK-12: It didn't take much effort. After all, they still knew exactly where we were under those circumstances.

AK-12: It was either GPS trackers or having a high vantage point.

AK-12: Once we understood that, it wasn't difficult figuring out the rest.

RPK-16: When we got here, we found out that Mr. J was the one in charge of this operation.

RPK-16: He told us that you were safe and had us wait here while he sent someone to fetch you.

RPK-16: 12 refused to cooperate at first and threw a tantrum.

RPK-16: It was kinda noisy, but then we got used to it.

AN-94: It wasn't that noisy.

AK-12: I don't trust them. J did a decent job in Bremen,

AK-12: But ensuring Ange's safety is my top priority.

AK-12: I only agreed to wait because I believe in Ange.

AK-12: So...have you had your meeting?

AK-12: How did it go?

Ange: I got some information and possible leads.

Ange: At the very least, I now have some idea about what to do.

Ange: So you're the aid that he promised?

Ange eyes Light and J, her gaze moving back and forth between them until finally settling on J.

Ange: Are you in any shape to help? Your injuries look pretty bad.

J: What, wanna spar, wardmate? I don't know who you're talking about, but we are indeed under official order to aid you.

J: It took us some time, but we eventually managed to take over this operation. Now Light and I are in charge of keeping tabs on you.

J: In other words, you can move around freely in Berlin.

AK-12: So who exactly was he, Ange?

Ange: ...The "Earl ".

Ange fishes out the gold coin from her pocket and rubs the intricate markings with her thumb.

A glistening griffin is etched onto the coin.

Ange: Or should I say...

Ange: Griffin Lyons.

AN-94: !

AN-94: Y-You mean...THAT Griffin?

AN-94: THE Griffin in "Griffin and Kryuger"?

AN-94: I hear he...

Ange: Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, it's him in the flesh.

Ange: I don't work for him, but he is very close with Zelinsky and Old Misha...

Ange: I can't tell if he can be trusted, but at the very least, he is on our side.

J: So... Uh, nevermind. I didn't hear anything.

J: What happens next is none of my business.

J: Light, I'm leaving you in charge of everything.

Light: Me?

J: You, duh. K sent me—a poor injured man—here, while he himself stayed behind in Bremen, having the time of his life.

J: Not that he expected I would have to work in the field.

J: In any case, I leave this in your capable hands.

Ange: You haven't asked for my opinion.

J: Well, any objections?

Ange: He doesn't look old enough to drink.

J: He may be young, but he's the most exceptional up-and-coming agent in the Stasi. You've seen what he's capable of, haven't you?

J: He's been commanding the operation to monitor you single-handedly. I didn't do anything.

Ange: So he's been wasting his "exceptional" talent on spying on us?

Ange: If I were you, I'd have already started investigating William's movements in Berlin.

Ange: If you hadn't been wasting precious time, I would've tracked down Leone and the others by now.

Light: I looked into it, Frau Angelia.

Ange: ...What?

Light: I don't know what your current objective is.

Light: But before I came to Berlin, I took over the investigation you were conducting in Bremen and followed through with the remaining leads.

Light: I have recorded everything in detail and compiled profiles...

Light: ...concerning the culprits arrested in Bremen—Leone, Hopps, and Powell.

AK-12: He's telling the truth, Ange. I read them.

Ange: You read them?

AK-12: I couldn't very well just sit here and wait, could I?

AK-12: The three of them have been transported to Berlin for imprisonment.

AK-12: But you're not gonna believe this.

AK-12: Leone was released due to mental illness. She's now living quite a cushy life at a sanatorium.

AK-12: Still in Berlin, obviously.

Light: According to my investigation, everything about Leone's release was highly dubious.

Light: I suspect a person of authority pulled some strings to protect her, but I have no others clues for the time being.

Ange: ...Explain the situation to me in detail.

Light: Yes, ma'am.

J: Wait, hold on.

J: You're not planning to have this conversation here, are you?

J: This really isn't the greatest spot, so I suggest you guys take this somewhere else... After all, you're free to go anywhere now.

AK-12: I agree, Ange.

AK-12: Surely you have a lot to discuss with us...

AK-12: About your conversation with Grif...the Earl ?

Ange: ...

Ange: ...Alright, let's go back to the apartment then.

Light: I'll come with you.

J: And I'll pass.

J: The protagonist shall retreat behind the scenes for now. Young people should be given the time to shine every now and then.

J: Isn't that right, Light? Now that you're back in your hometown, don't forget to make time to visit your—

Light: Let's go, Frau Angelia.

Ange: Sure.

Ange glances at the youth with delicate features.

He's young, brave, remarkable, and ambitious... Just like her when she was young.

But just for a brief second...

His face overlaps with Morridow's in her mind.

"Here must all distrust be left; all cowardice must here be dead."

There is no Hell on earth.

Spirits are buried in the ashes; souls fade into oblivion.

Life is fragile. All it takes is a single bullet, a fire, some terrible luck to be snuffed out.

Ange: ...

Ange: ...You can't scare me.

Walking through an intrusive memory in her mind, Ange stands in the midst of an unfolding disaster.

The shivering young girl can only pray helplessly as she cowers behind a blast containment box.

Ange gazes at the girl as her ears are assaulted by ear-splitting noise around them.

Ange: Hey.

Ange: Get up.

Ange: ...I'm telling you to get up.

Amid the commotion, the girl lifts her head and meets Ange's gaze.

In the bottom of her teary eyes lies a whirlpool of heavy darkness.

Ange finds herself tumbling down this endless abyss.

...

Ange: ...

Ange sits up woozily in bed and rubs her temple to clear her head.

AK-12: ...

At this point, she doesn't even bother to ask what AK-12 is doing in her room. She's got used to it.

Ange: Pour me some tea.

AK-12: ...Are you alright?

Only then does Ange notice the grim look on AK-12's face.

Ange: What do you mean?

AK-12: You were moaning and talking in your sleep.

AK-12: You seemed to be having a nightmare. To be honest, it was really unlike you.

AK-12: It grossed me out a bit.

Ange: ...Oh, yeah.

Ange: I dreamed that I went back to Statesec. Zelinsky threw me a welcoming banquet.

Ange: All the dishes were duck.

AK-12: You hate duck?

Ange: I'd rather eat dirt.

Ange places a hand on the back of her neck as she softly cranes it this way and that, making it click.

AK-12 knows better than to ask any more questions. She simply gets up and makes a cup of very strong tea, which she leaves on the bedside table.

AK-12: The Commander got in touch.

Ange: Tell them we'll be in Alt-Berlin in an hour.

Ange: We'll meet at Athena's Owl.

AK-12: Okay.

Placing her hands on her knees, Ange eyes the tea stalks floating vertically in the tea cup.

Ange: Do you think the Earl can be trusted?

AK-12: Don't tell me you've forgotten—he is a friend of Shaw's. Don't expect me to badmouth him.

Ange: I've never liked him.

Ange: Our meeting has only confirmed my belief.

Ange: We have nothing in common.

AK-12: But he is helping us, that's a fact.

AK-12: And he has a point when he says that we don't have a choice, Ange.

Ange: ...

Ange takes out the coin from her pocket again. She peers down at it and lets out a snort.

Ange: It irks me to be completely at his mercy.

AK-12: But there really is no other way.

AK-12: Besides, what he's asking you to do is on your own agenda to begin with.

AK-12: He just rubbed it in your face to rile you up.

AK-12: And speaking of your agenda, we had a little chat with the Stasi whelp this morning.

Ange: ...You mean Light?

AK-12: Yes.

AK-12: You don't seem to like him?

Ange: Quite the contrary.

Ange flips the coin up and catches it on the back of her hand.

Ange: He may be young, but he's level-headed, meticulous, good in a fight, and most importantly, he has impeccable manners.

Ange: J is right—he has great potential and a bright future ahead of him. I have a lot of admiration for him.

AK-12: However?

AK-12 ponders for a moment and points up.

Ange: However, I initially held Morridow in exactly the same regard.

Ange lifts her hand and reveals the heads of the coin.

AK-12: I've never seen a male Nyto.

AK-12 looks a little glum.

Ange: You know that's not what I mean.

Ange: I'm not saying there must be something wrong with Light, but after what happened in Bremen...

Ange: I can't bring myself to trust anyone who popped out of nowhere.

Ange shrugs and pockets the coin again before picking up her cup of tea and taking a sip.

AK-12: But on the bright side, if he really turns out to be another spy...

AK-12: Then Paradeus has basically delivered an opening wrapped as a gift straight to you, don't you think?

Ange: We'll leave him be for now.

Ange: Back to the subject—what have you found out?

AK-12: Everything the Earl told you checks out.

AK-12: Shortly after we and the Stasi captured Leone, she was transported to Berlin on official notice.

AK-12: Once she arrived, she filed an appeal.

AK-12: The court ruled that she suffered serious mental and physical trauma and exempted her from serving a sentence.

AK-12: That's how she got off scot-free.

Ange: ...

AK-12: You're going to break your cup.

Ange: Where is she now? At a sanatorium?

AK-12: That's right. She's at Galatea Sanatorium, enjoying the best security and treatment.

Ange: For god's sake.

Ange slams the tea cup down onto the table, spilling more tea than she has drunk.

AK-12: And as RPK has previously mentioned, all data in the Flora Institute has been wiped clean.

AK-12: We cannot trace them directly, but fortunately, the Bremen government has some public records of several people and organizations who have worked with the Institute in the past.

AK-12: We've compiled a list.

Ange: We're looking for a mysterious figure who's located in Berlin, in a position of considerable power, interested in Leone's research—could be working in some relevant fields themselves, gained prominence in the last two years, and has an otherwise unknown past.

AK-12: I'm afraid there isn't such a person on our list.

Ange: I knew it wouldn't be so simple.

Ange takes the file from AK-12, flips through a few pages half-heartedly, and puts in on the table.

Ange: Let's leave that for now. We'll discuss the rest after our meeting with the Commander.

AK-12: You're really looking forward to it.

Ange: Even a fish would poke its head out of water to breathe if there's no oxygen in the water.

Ange: Let's go.

AK-12: Okay~

...

The Commander, panting heavily, flings the door open and steps onto the wooden floorboards like a high school student who barely makes it into the classroom in time.

Bartender: ...

This out-of-place newcomer has instantly attracted the attention of the handful of customers and staff inside the bar. The piercing stares are making them a little uncomfortable.

Commander: ...Ahem, uh... Excuse me.

The Commander enters the bar and carefully closes the door. They scratch their head and apologize for the disturbance.

Slam!

Just then, an even more abrupt noise comes from the back of the bar, drawing away all the hostile glares.

???: What are you lot looking at?

Swinging her legs up onto the table, the ferocious-looking woman snaps at the other customers.

Realizing she isn't to be messed with, everyone averts their eyes and returns to their own business.

The Commander chuckles to themselves as they walk up to the woman's table, drag over a chair and sits down.

Commander: Could you remove your boots from the table, please?

Ange: You should learn the proper way of dealing with people like these, Commander.

Commander: I simply wished to keep a low profile... Is it really okay for you to be so conspicuous?

Ange: Humph... Don't you worry.

Ange: Who knows how many of them are actual customers?

Ange snorts and lowers her voice.

They proceed to eye each other wordlessly.

The first to break the awkward silence is the Commander.

Commander: Pleased to finally meet you, Captain Tsoi.

Commander: I am the AR Team's current commander, also in charge of Area S09 under Griffin's jurisdiction.

Ange: Pleased to meet you, Commander. I am Anna Viktorovna Tsoi...but you can just stick to calling me Ange.

Ange: Seriously? Do we have to do this?

Commander: Well, the ice has to be broken, right?

The Commander chortles.

Ange: How about a drink?

Commander: No, thanks. I have an upcoming operation, so I shouldn't.

Ange: Get them a ginger ale.

Ange snaps her fingers at the waiter and makes an order. Then she lifts her legs off the table.

The Commander watches Ange with a smile.

A little unnerved by the stare, Ange frowns.

Ange: What, you don't like ginger ale?

Commander: That's not it. I'm just suddenly struck by the fact that we're actually having a conversation face-to-face.

Commander: I've never seen this side of you through the communicator.

Ange: You talk too much.

Ange crosses her arms and snickers.

Ange: So you've talked to DEFY?

Commander: Yes, I've also met RPK-16. We talked at the submarine base.

Commander: She's working for you now?

Ange: More or less. How many Dolls have you brought with you?

Commander: Just the AR Team and 404, plus Dandelion, of course.

Commander: The Earl has also supplied an additional Squad Griffin.

Ange: You've met him?

Commander: Not exactly, but we did talk.

Ange: How do you find him?

Commander: This was the first time I've talked to the Earl ever since I joined Griffin.

Commander: He strikes me as a very different man compared to Mr. Kryuger...but is equally bold and driven.

Ange: Why has he summoned you to Berlin?

Commander: For the same reason you're here.

Ange: You know what I'm doing here?

Commander: I'm unaware of the specifics.

Commander: But I suppose it's about Paradeus.

Commander: After all, this is why you've come to Germany in the first place...and I can't exactly pretend I didn't know about your operation in Bremen.

Ange: ...Humph.

Ange grunts. She drops an ice cube into her empty glass and pours herself some whisky.

Ange: He asked you to come to Berlin so that he'll have another moron doing his bidding and risking their life for him.

Commander: You seem rather antagonistic towards the Earl.

Ange: The Earl and Mr. Kryuger are as different as night and day. If Kryuger is like you, then the Earl is more like me.

Ange: We will stop at nothing to achieve our ends, but he's even more ruthless than me.

Ange: I suggest that you don't trust him too blindly.

Commander: I won't, Ange.

Commander: Because we aren't risking our lives for anyone in particular.

Commander: Everything we do is for the sake of making this world a better place.

Ange: I sure hope so.

Commander: What's the situation on your end? Any new breakthroughs?

Ange: My endeavors in Bremen proved to be fruitless, and I haven't made much headway here in Berlin either.

Ange: I did come into contact with someone from Paradeus, but she escaped.

Commander: You mean...the woman called Morridow?

Ange: Yes.

Commander: Actually...I came across a person by following a lead provided by the Earl.

Commander: She bears a remarkable resemblance to Morridow.

Ange: What?

Commander: Let me finish.

Commander: The resemblance is purely physical. From what we can see, it's most probably a different person.

Commander: Her name is Machlian, and she's been active in Bohnsdorf—a village nearby—before we captured her.

Ange: In case you don't know, do let me warn you.

Ange: Morridow is an expert of infiltration and disguise. She's deceived me and Ulrich and even managed to fool DEFY.

Commander: Right, that has been accounted for.

Commander: Which is why we're still keeping this Machlian under observation... Though Dandelion hasn't noticed anything odd so far.

Commander: I'll notify you immediately if there's any new development.

Ange: You left her on her own? You're leaving a Nyto unsupervised?

Commander: Dandelion and the Squad Griffin are keeping an eye on her. Not to mention she's still unconscious.

Ange: Hm... Alright.

Ange: But don't hold out too much hope.

Commander: I won't.

Ange: The Earl told me that William is planning something big in Berlin.

Ange: Then he just dumped all the work onto my lap and left, saying he had more important stuff to do.

Ange: I hope he didn't mean picking you up from the airport by that.

Commander: I doubt that's what he meant.

Commander: He never met me in person. He simply issued my orders through the comms.

Commander: But...what could William be up to?

Ange: I don't know yet.

Commander: If that's true, we don't have much time.

Ange: I'm well aware of that.

Commander: ...I'll have Dandelion look into it once I get back.

Commander: We may be able to find something useful.

Ange: The bait I left in Bremen hasn't been entirely gobbled up yet.

Ange: Whoever it is, she's given herself away, and I'll soon have a lead.

Commander: Got it.

Commander: If you need any help, please get in touch.

Commander: I'll come at once.

Ange: ...

Ange swirls the whisky around in her glass. After a brief moment of silence, she cracks an unusual smile.

She stands up from her chair and walks over to the Commander.

Commander: What, are you going to snap my neck?

The Commander looks up at her in bemusement and asks jokingly.

Ange: ...

Ange does not answer. She simply pats the Commander on the shoulder and downs her drink in one go.

Then she slams the glass down next to the Commander's ginger ale.

Ange: Phew...

Ange: That felt good.

The Commander blinks. They are about to say something but then think better of it.

Ange has been through a lot. The Commander can tell immediately.

And right now, in this unfamiliar country, they're pretty much the only person she can trust.

With this in mind, the Commander smiles and clinks their own ginger ale against Ange's empty glass, then knocks back the ginger ale as well.

Ange has done the best she could. The Commander knows this, and there is nothing more to be said.

Unless they actually want Ange to break their neck.

Commander: So we have an agreement?

Ange: Yeah, I've taken up enough of your time.

Commander: Then I'll be heading back.

Commander: If Machlian wakes up, I'll have a lot of questions for her.

Ange: Machian...or Morridow?

Commander: ...Machlian, for the time being.

Ange: Humph... Alright.

After seeing off the Commander, Ange shakes her head lightly and taps the comms in her ear.

Ange: Enough with the chit-chat, 12.

Ange: Get ready. We're paying Leone a visit.

Clink.

A melting ice cube slides down and knocks against the bottom of the glass.

The bar is now empty.

...
Part 2: Cretan Liar

2

Outside Galatea Sanatorium.

Light: Frau Angelia!

Light catches up to Ange, panting heavily.

Ange: Boy.

Ange comes to an abrupt halt.

Light: Hm?

Ange: If the situation were any different, I would never have let you follow me around.

Ange: If you insist on working with me, we've got to lay down some ground rules... First of all, don't "Frau" me.

Light: Uh... Sure?

Ange: We'll leave the rest till later.

Ange turns away coldly and marches on.

Light: (Sighs)

AK-12: Don't mind her. Ange isn't being particularly hard on you.

AK-12: She's like that to everyone.

Light: Okay... Thanks.

Light smiles helplessly at AK-12 and gives her a nod before catching up with Ange again.

After a few paces, the grandiose building appears before them. Ange stops again, seemingly in no hurry.

Ange: So this is it? The sanatorium where Leone's been admitted to?

Light: Yes, Leone is currently receiving treatment here.

Ange: Humph... I didn't think she'd agree to meet.

Ange: If she refused to see me, I wouldn't be able to force her in this kind of place.

Light: Fortunately, Leone seems quite eager to talk.

Light: She accepted your invitation almost immediately.

Ange: I hope she'll give us something useful.

Ange crosses her arms and glances at the main entrance.

Ange: For a place that's meant to be peaceful and quiet, there are a lot of random people hanging around, don't you think?

Ange: 15?

AK-15: We're detecting a large amount of cameras.

Light: ...Oh.

Light seems to have realized something and scratches his head sheepishly.

Light: They're from Berlin Television Broadcasting.

Ange: Berlin Television Broadcasting?

Light: The main branch of the Deutscher Fernsehfunk, the largest state-sanctioned broadcasting company in Germany.

AK-12: What are news reporters doing here? Other than Leone, are there any other high-profile patients in this sanatorium?

Ange: Maybe...it isn't a patient.

Ange gazes at the door thoughtfully.

...

In the sanatorium.

An interview with a certain high-profile figure is well under way in an isolated room.

Shadowless: Thank you very much for making the time to attend this interview today, Mrs. Gray.

???: You are very welcome. This is something we've agreed upon.

???: It is very important for someone like me to play nice with exceptional reporters like you.

Shadowless: You jest. As one of the best surgeons in Germany...in the entire world, even...

Shadowless: I doubt you'd need to pay any heed to public opinion.

Mrs. Gray: Haha... I don't believe it is a reporter's job to sway public opinion.

Mrs. Gray: Your remark makes it clear that you still harbor some kind of misunderstanding and skepticism towards me.

Mrs. Gray: The way I see it, your job is to showcase the true side of society for more to see.

Mrs. Gray: In a certain sense, you are the bridge through which we communicate with the people. It is entirely up to you to convey our aspirations accurately.

Shadowless: Does that mean you consider yourself separate from "the people", Mrs. Gray?

The young and attractive reporter asks a very pointed question, but this woman known as Mrs. Gray is not fazed at all.

Mrs. Gray: Indeed. Many are afraid of admitting this⁠—a fear that I don't understand.

Mrs. Gray: As a doctor, I have dedicated most of my life to spreading hope to more people.

Mrs. Gray: This is precisely why I know better than anyone else that scalpels alone will not improve people's lives.

Mrs. Gray: I wish to become an advocate who can bring about positive change and improve the welfare of the people.

Mrs. Gray: To do that, I must first come to terms with what I'm doing.

Mrs. Gray: If I don't even have the courage to admit it, why should people believe in me?

Shadowless: You sound exactly like a politician.

Shadowless: But I must say you are incredibly persuasive. If you ever decide to run for office, I will definitely vote for you.

Mrs. Gray: Thank you, Miss Shadowless. You honor me with your support.

Shadowless: Now back to the subject. We wish to learn more about "Idunn", the new anti-Collapse serum that Galatea is about to distribute, in the interview today.

Shadowless: Idunn is being marketed as an affordable but highly effective drug. According to the spokesperson of your company, it is completely unlike any other existing drugs.

Shadowless: This bold claim has been called into question by multiple scientists and dignitaries, but as a surgeon, you are extremely outspoken in your support for Idunn.

Shadowless: Nobody doubts your professional skills or ethics, but it's quite interesting that you would vouch for Galatea's product even though you are in their employment.

Shadowless: Does your support stem from any commercial consideration?

Mrs. Gray: I agree that to an outsider, it must be strange for a surgeon to vouch for an anti-Collapse formulation.

Mrs. Gray: After all, certain medical fields are sometimes so far apart they might as well be different industries altogether.

Shadowless: People are having misgivings mostly because of this. How would you respond to such doubts?

Mrs. Gray: Here's my response—don't worry, I will never exploit the trust that my patients have in me.

Mrs. Gray: I may have a bit of a reputation, but I'm still only one among all my fellow physicians.

Mrs. Gray: My confidence in Galatea's new product is based on its own merits. I simply wish more people will benefit from its success and receive better medical treatment.

Shadowless: Thanks to Galatea's prevalent marketing campaign, Idunn's alleged effects are no secret in Berlin.

Shadowless: The drug has indeed yielded some remarkable results in clinical trials, but it still has to go through a lot of standard procedures before official distribution can begin.

Shadowless: The general public perceives this vetting process as evidence that the government is impeding Idunn's distribution and is even taking to the streets in protest.

Shadowless: Is this a premeditated marketing strategy on Galatea's part?

Mrs. Gray: ...

Cameraman: ...Hey, Shadow!

Mrs. Gray: The recent unsanctioned demonstrations in Berlin are deeply regrettable.

Mrs. Gray: Galatea gives the government its full support and understanding in following standard procedures. We also have absolute confidence in passing the rigorous vetting process.

Mrs. Gray: Please wait patiently for dawn to break.

Mrs. Gray: Do not fall before the first ray of sunlight pierces the darkness.

Shadowless: Thank you once again for attending this interview.

Shadowless closes her notebook and bows politely to Gray.

Mrs. Gray: I'm sorry that the interview had to be cut short.

Shadowless: No problem at all. I understand you have an extremely busy schedule that's frequently subjected to last-minute changes.

Shadowless: I am a bit curious though—why have you suddenly made a detour to this sanatorium? Do you have patients here?

Mrs. Gray: No, this visit is not work-related; it's a personal matter.

Shadowless: I see.

Shadowless: In that case, we'll be taking our leave. The interview will air after some editing.

Mrs. Gray: Thank you, Miss Shadowless.

Shadowless: Don't mention it. Just doing my job... Hm?

Shadowless suddenly lets out a sound of surprise while she is packing her bag.

Mrs. Gray: Is something wrong?

Shadowless: No... It's nothing. I just saw a familiar face.

Shadowless: Sorry, Herr Wechsler, please tidy up for me. I'll be right back.

Cameraman: Hold on, Shadow!

Shadowless leaves the room in a rush.

Mrs. Gray: Then if you'd please.

Cameraman: Dear me... Young people are always so driven.

Cameraman: If she caused any offense with her youthful candor, please do forgive her.

Mrs. Gray: Not at all. Miss Shadowless is a brilliant young lady.

Mrs. Gray gets up from her chair languidly.

Mrs. Gray: Excuse me while I go to the restroom.

...

Mrs. Gray: ...

The running faucet under which Mrs. Gray is washing her hands produces the only sound in the otherwise quiet restroom.

Mrs. Gray fastidiously cleans her long, slender fingers with foamy soap and rinses it under the faucet.

Mrs. Gray: I don't take unscheduled interviews.

After pulling out several tissues, she starts tidying up her appearance in front of the mirror and says out of the blue.

Ange: ...

In an inconspicuous corner of the mirror, a woman suddenly emerges.

Ange: Your reputation precedes you, "Lady of Ashes".

Mrs. Gray: Please, just call me Gray.

Mrs. Gray dries her hands and inspects them again. Satisfied that they are thoroughly clean, she balls up the tissues and discards them in the nearby garbage can.

Ange: You don't seem at all concerned about being stalked by a stranger.

Mrs. Gray: If you were a stranger, I would have alerted the guards immediately.

Mrs. Gray: But I do have the patience to entertain a certain Miss Anna Viktorovna Tsoi.

Ange: You know me?

Mrs. Gray: You are quite the big name in the Berlin government right now.

Ange: Should I be surprised that a doctor knows all about the government?

Mrs. Gray: A lot of my patients gossip.

Ange gazes at the reflection of Mrs. Gray's serene face in the mirror and softly closes the restroom door.

Ange: I have some questions for you.

Mrs. Gray: As a fellow woman, don't you understand the importance of respecting a lady's moment of privacy?

Through the mirror, Mrs. Gray sees what Ange just did, but it doesn't seem to alarm her. Instead, she casually takes out her pressed powder.

Ange: I don't have the need to preen in front of a mirror in a restroom.

Mrs. Gray: With that face, I can see why you don't.

Ange: You've heard of Leone Michel, I gather?

Mrs. Gray: Of course. Leone is an expert in biochemistry.

Mrs. Gray: Galatea has offered an olive branch to her many times, which she repeatedly refused.

Mrs. Gray: She is certainly a woman of character—just like you, Miss Angelia.

Ange: Her character didn't do her any good.

Mrs. Gray: Hard to say if yours will also lead you down the same fate.

Ange's eyes narrow at Mrs. Gray's subtle threat.

Ange: There seems to be more to your relationship with her than you're letting on.

Mrs. Gray: Sorry to disappoint, but I am both mentally and physically a heterosexual female.

Mrs. Gray: Otherwise, you would make a decent partner.

Ange: ...

Mrs. Gray puts away her powder and fishes out a lipstick. She turns around and looks at Ange.

Ange's gaze drift from the lipstick in Gray's hand up to her lips out of reflex as the flirtatious remark sinks in.

Gray seems to have no intention of applying the lipstick. She is just playing with it, twisting the lipstick piston up and down.

At her mocking and disdainful gesture, Ange inhales through gritted teeth and balls up her fists.

Ange: You know exactly why I've brought up Leone.

Ange: She couldn't have committed those crimes in Bremen all by herself.

Ange: She has somebody behind her, who pulled some strings to have her transported to Berlin—to this very facility—after she was arrested.

Ange: They also helped her evade legal sanctions.

Mrs. Gray: What a gruesome tale.

Mrs. Gray: So let me get this straight... You suspect someone exploited their authority to help Leone escape her punishment.

Mrs. Gray: Then you appear before me under such pretext.

Mrs. Gray: How astonishing. What on earth have I done to raise your unfounded suspicion?

Ange: The Flora Institute has a very limited number of collaborators, especially in Berlin.

Ange: The only person on that list who also happens to be here is you, Mrs. Gray.

After twisting her lipstick up and down countless times, Gray finally lifts it up to her lips and applies it delicately.

Ange watches her go through the practiced motion. Her lips, painted bright red to begin with, appear even more sultry.

Mrs. Gray: Is that all you've got?

Mrs. Gray: I don't even know what to say... Don't you think you've made quite a few logical leaps in your deduction process?

Mrs. Gray: The Angelia I've heard so much about is an extraordinary special agent.

Mrs. Gray: Not some third-rate detective who makes groundless accusations based on subjective speculations.

Gray replaces the cap on her lipstick and smacks her lips lightly with hooded eyes.

Ange is still watching her unblinkingly, gauging her reaction.

Ange: You've worked together. That's evidence enough for me.

Ange: A surgeon collaborating frequently with Leone, who specializes in biochemistry.

Ange: What were the two of you doing?

Gray lifts her head and stares at Ange coldly. She slowly reaches into the right pocket of her coat.

Ange: ...

Ange is bracing herself for whatever Gray extracts from her pocket, but it turns out to be nothing but a lollipop.

Mrs. Gray: Miss Angelia.

Mrs. Gray: If I remember correctly...you're from the Soviet Statesec, aren't you?

Mrs. Gray: From my limited understanding, there has been some conflict between you and Statesec, and you do not answer to them anymore.

Mrs. Gray: Yet here you are, all alone in Germany, being in frequent contact with the Stasi.

Mrs. Gray: If everything I just stated is true, I must admit you have me very much intrigued.

Mrs. Gray: What exactly are you doing here? What happened between you and the Neo-Soviets?

Ange: ...Humph.

Gray shoves the wrapping she just removed into her pocket and puts the lollipop into her mouth, leaving only the stick hanging outside.

Mrs. Gray: Everyone has their secrets, Miss Angelia. I understand if you do not wish to satisfy my curiosity.

Mrs. Gray: After all, who doesn't have a skeleton in their closet?

Mrs. Gray: My situation is also rather complicated. Trade secrets are still secrets, even if they aren't anywhere near as important as state secrets.

Every word she just said sounds like jab at Ange.

Ange: Your non-answer is an answer in itself.

Ange: This whole business lacks a logical explanation.

Ange: And since you refuse to give me one, I'm afraid I'll have to substitute it with my own.

Gray's lollipop stick wiggles up and down like the pendulum of her thoughts.

After a moment of silence, she shrugs and opens her mouth hesitantly.

Mrs. Gray: Actually, I answered this very question just a few minutes ago...asked by a reporter.

Mrs. Gray: The research of the Flora Institute is indeed rather irrelevant to my profession, but I have never been one to be constrained by such field categorizations.

Mrs. Gray: I simply wish to make this world a better place—I know you may find that hard to believe, but it is the truth.

Mrs. Gray: I have both the interest and courage in trying new things as long as I see the potential.

Mrs. Gray: This goes for Leone's work as well as Idunn. I have also funded a lot of other research. If you're so inclined, you may investigate them one by one and I'll be happy to assist in your investigation. After all, I don't know if there are other cases like Leone in my portfolio.

She lets out a sigh. The lollipop knocks against her teeth inside her mouth.

Mrs. Gray: Leone is very talented. Her research could have been such a boon for humankind.

Mrs. Gray: I deeply regret that she has gone down this misguided path.

Ange: She was used.

Ange: The real source of evil is whoever's manipulated her from behind the scenes.

Mrs. Gray: Then I sincerely wish you all the success in hunting down this manipulator and bringing them to justice.

Ange: ...

Ange's fingers twitch.

It suddenly occurs to her that she is dealing with someone who's a different kind of trouble.

Ange: What if the people who interviewed you finds out about this scandal?

Mrs. Gray: Then I'll be forced to issue an apology.

Mrs. Gray: I will apologize for not discovering my collaborator's criminal intent in time and denounce the Flora Institute for their unethical practices.

Mrs. Gray: Meanwhile, the Gray Institute of Biotechnology will make a donation to support medical aid.

Ange: After that, this incident will be swept under the carpet, along with anyone who investigated it?

Mrs. Gray: You Soviet agents are so amusing.

Mrs. Gray: Don't make a movie villain out of me, Miss Angelia.

Mrs. Gray: I really do like you, you know.

Ange: ...Do you now? Well, I don't know what I've done to deserve your admiration.

Mrs. Gray: Perhaps one day, we will find ourselves standing on the same side, fighting for the same goal.

Mrs. Gray: Before that, I don't mind making friends with someone like you—I don't usually bother wasting so much time on idle chit-chat with people I don't like.

Gray straightens up and makes for the door. She puts her hand on the door knob.

—!

Ange grabs her by the arm out of reflex.

Ange: ...

Gray's arm is incredibly slender. Ange has the feeling that she could snap this important tool upon which Gray's entirely livelihood depends if she just applied a bit more strength.

Mrs. Gray: ...

Other than wiggling her lollipop stick, Gray does not react to Ange's impudent action.

She gazes at Ange's arm and after a two-second pause, she reaches into her pocket.

Mrs. Gray: Your prosthetic limbs seem to be in terrible condition, Miss Angelia.

Mrs. Gray: You are very welcome to visit me at my private clinic.

Mrs. Gray: I'd be happy to fix you up, free of charge.

She produces a name card and offers it to Ange.

On the card is her name, "Mrs. Gray", and the address of her clinic.

Ange: ...

Ange slowly releases her grip and takes the name card wordlessly.

Ange: Are you this friendly to everyone?

Mrs. Gray: Not at all. You're a special case, Miss Angelia.

Ange: Am I? I wonder why.

Gray takes the lollipop out of her mouth with an ambiguous half-smile and tosses it into the garbage can by the door.

She suddenly leans in close to Ange, who takes a step back instinctively, only to find a wall directly behind her.

Mrs. Gray: It's been a pleasure talking to you, Angelia.

Mrs. Gray: ...Tell me, do you miss the time you spent in Bremen?

Gray's lips hover right next to Ange's earlobe. She murmurs each word distinctly in a low, husky voice.

Ange: ...!

While Ange is still frozen in shock, Gray has already opened the restroom door and swanned off.

Ange: Wait!

Ange recovers from her momentary daze and bursts through the door in pursuit.

Gray is already on the other end of the hallway with two security guards in tow.

Just before she disappears around the corner, she glances back at Ange with a sly smile.

Ange: Flipping hell... Dammit!

Ange punches the wall in anger. Sprinkles of dust fall from the ceiling.

The toilet in a locked cubicle inside the restroom suddenly flushes. The door opens and RPK-16 saunters out.

RPK-16: What an interesting woman, don't you think?

Ange: It's her.

Ange: She's the one behind Leone! There's no mistake!

RPK-16: What a shame. Maybe I should've made my move before she left?

Ange: ...There's no point. We can't do anything to her.

Ange: She knows that, which is why she was being so brazen.

RPK-16: Should we just take her out?

Ange: That's even more pointless. Paradeus surely has more than one Gray.

RPK-16: I understand.

Ange inhales deeply to collect herself.

Gray's face is deeply imprinted into her mind.

Ange: This isn't over yet... Just you wait.

...
Part 3: Reflection (side)

3

...

Shadowless: Hold on!

A familiar figure flits past. Shadowless dashes out of the reception room in pursuit, but the figure is nowhere to be seen.

...

She stands at the intersection and glares sullenly at the empty hallways.

Assistant: Sh-Shadow!

Assistant: You gave me such a scare... What's the matter with you? Why did you run off all of a sudden?

Assistant: What if we made a bad impression on Mrs. Gray?!

The assistant comes running after Shadowless and admonishes her while still out of breath.

Shadowless finally gives up. She turns back and shakes her head at her assistant.

Shadowless: Sorry, I thought I saw someone I knew...

Shadowless: Did Mrs. Gray say anything?

Assistant: Well, no...

Shadowless: Really? That woman sure is a crafty one.

Assistant: Shadow!

The assistant's eyes widen in alarm.

Assistant: That's Mrs. Gray you're talking about! How could you say that?

Shadowless: Eli, if you truly want to become a good reporter, you must learn to see through these celebrities' facades for whom they really are.

Assistant: But Mrs. Gray feels genuinely like a good person...

Assistant: Besides, we really do need cheaper drugs desperately.

Assistant: They finally developed one. Isn't this fantastic news for the people?

Shadowless: Personal morals are irrelevant to people like her.

Shadowless: I'll refrain from commenting on Mrs. Gray's position, but she is very smart and knows exactly what we reporters want to hear—I'll give her that.

Shadowless: She always says just the right thing to win people over.

Shadowless: She didn't get to where she is today with just her pretty face.

Shadowless shoves her hands into the pockets of her trench coat and looks in the direction of the reception room with a piercing gaze that seems to see through all deception.

Shadowless: Idunn could indeed be an effective cure... But this cake will be gobbled up long before the people who need it most can even get to it.

Shadowless: Remember, Eli—our job as the media is to uncover and piece together the truth.

Shadowless: The nature of our work requires us to be critical of everything we see.

Shadowless: At the very least, we must give the full picture so that the public can have all the facts, and not just things that these people want them to know.

Assistant: ...This is way too dark.

Assistant: Your way of looking at things, I mean.

Shadowless: It's reality, Eli.

Shadowless: These corporations and the government are all birds of a feather.

Shadowless: Don't be fooled by their glamorous appearance. In the end, the only ones we can trust are ourselves.

Shadowless watches as her other colleagues leave the reception room with all their packed equipment.

Shadowless: Let's head back.

Assistant: Okay...

The group make for the main exit with Shadowless trailing behind. She stops and looks back at the hallway behind her.

Assistant: Shadow?

Shadowless: Coming.

After the press corps has left, Light strolls out from a corner that Shadowless' gaze has swept over.

Light: ...Her sixth sense is sharp as ever.

Click.

Ange: Light, where are you?

Ange: We're done over here.

Light: Right. I'll be right there.

Light turns off his comms and strokes his chin.

...She didn't see me, I hope.

With a faint sense of unease, he once again retreats into the blind spot of the CCTV system.
Part 4: Heraclitus' River I

4

...

In the courtyard of the sanatorium, gentle sunshine caresses the grassy lawn, filling the air with an earthy aroma.

Nurse: Look, Frau Leone.

Nurse: The cornflowers are blooming.

Leone: ...

Leone: ...Sorry, could you push me somewhere else?

Leone: I don't want to see any flowers.

Nurse: Oh...sorry.

Leone: It's alright.

Leone: Also...it feels a bit chilly. Could you fetch me a blanket?

Nurse: Chilly? Sure, I'll go get one from the medical room. Please stay where you are.

Leone: Ha...

Leone looks down at her arm in a cast. Her fingers are trussed up.

She can't even stand up from her wheelchair.

The courtyard of the sanatorium was the work of a famous landscape designer. All the flowers and herbs have been chosen and planted with great care.

Everything within sight exists to alleviate stress.

Leone takes a deep breath.

...They probably don't get a lot of patients who are sensitive to the scent of flowers.

What do they do with patients with hay fever?

Clatter.

A presence suddenly emerges from behind. Her wheelchair is being pushed by the handles once more.

Leone: That was quick, Nurse.

Ange: I forgot your blanket though. I hope you don't mind?

Leone: ...It's you?!

Leone tries to jump to her feet unconsciously, but Ange presses her down firmly on the shoulder with her bionic arm.

Ange: Hush... I just want to talk.

Leone bites her lip. She is shivering all over in fear. She does not dare defy Ange.

Not just because her very life is in Ange's hand right now, but also because the sight of Ange reminds her of the white specter that has plagued her mind incessantly.

Leone: I believe I've told the caretakers to send you away.

Ange: And you think I'd walk away just like that?

Leone: ...

Ange: You agreed to meet me. What changed your mind all of a sudden?

Ange eyes Leone intently. She doesn't look at all like a recuperating patient. She looks rather haggard, as if she has recently been through an ordeal.

Ange: Was Gray here to see you?

Leone: !

Leone flinches, which confirms Ange's suspicion.

Ange: She heard you were going to meet us and came to warn you, didn't she?

Ange: Did she tell you to keep your mouth shut? You know something that she doesn't want anybody to find out, don't you?

Leone: Stop asking. I won't tell you anything.

Leone grips the armrests of her wheelchair, her feeble body still trembling.

She looks incredibly frail, but at the same time very resolute.

Ange: You know I won't give up so easily.

Leone: You don't understand at all, Angelia.

Leone: She isn't someone that a small-time special agent like you can mess with.

Leone: For your own sake...just forget about this whole business. Let us both have some peace.

Leone grows increasingly agitated. Even her broken fingers are curling up.

Leone: ...I just want to live.

Ange: That doesn't sound like something a person who's attempted to commit suicide would say.

Leone: Ha... Thanks to you.

Leone: I have a new-found appreciation for life.

Leone: ...Oh, by the way.

As if struck by a sudden thought, Leone lifts her head.

Leone: They give off very similar vibes.

Ange: Who?

Leone: Gray and your subordinate.

Ange: RPK-16?

Leone: I don't know her name, but I'm talking about the Doll who broke my arm.

Leone: I know it's none of my business, but I suggest that you keep an eye on her.

Ange: You're right—it's none of your business.

Ange sizes up Leone and glances at her watch. The nurse will be returning soon.

Ange: I'll be back.

Leone: Don't bother.

Leone: I won't change my mind.

By then, the presence behind her is already no more.

Nurse: Frau Leone, I'm back!

Nurse: I'm putting the blanket on your lap, okay? ...Hm? W-Why are you so clammy?

Nurse: Frau Leone?

...

AK-12: I gather it didn't go well?

Ange: We're just a bit too late.

Ange: Gray came and threatened Leone. She wouldn't tell me anything.

RPK-16: How efficient of her. Are you giving up just like that?

RPK-16: If you can't bring yourself to do it, I don't mind stepping in... I'm sure Miss Leone would love to continue our intimate little "game".

Ange: No need. Leone is very adamant right now. It won't end well if we force her.

Ange: Leave her be for now. I have another idea.

Ange shifts her attention to Light, who's looking a little disheartened. But once he notices Ange's gaze, he pulls himself together right away.

Light: I will have people watching this place to ensure Leone's personal safety.

Ange: Good. That is certainly a necessary precaution. She may be safe for the moment, but that could change any minute.

Ange: Keep an eye on her for now. We'll tackle this some other way.

Light: Should I gather information on Mrs. Gray?

Ange: She is a possible lead, but I don't see much point in pursuing it. She's constantly under the spotlight. If there's anything fishy about her, somebody would've noticed by now.

Light: So what do you suggest?

Ange: I want to see Powell. Can you make the arrangements?

Light: Powell? He's currently serving prison time. I don't know if we'll get through, but I'll try.

Light: Still, why him?

Ange: You don't need to know. I've got my own plans.

Light: ...Alright.

Light: I'll get started straight away.

Light is a little taken aback by Ange's harsh response, but in the end, he just nods and takes his leave.

RPK-16: ...

RPK-16 shoots Ange a questioning look and drawls after Light is out of earshot.

RPK-16: Suspicious of him, Ange?

Ange: You got any objections?

RPK-16: No, but just as a reminder, paranoia can affect your judgment.

RPK-16: We're not in Bremen anymore.

AK-12: But Gray was TOO fast. It's too much of a coincidence... This is exactly like how it was in Bremen.

AK-12: Even if it isn't Light, one of his subordinates could be leaking our plans.

AK-12: Don't forget—if Gray has the power to get Leone acquitted...

AK-12: Then she's more than capable of planting moles in the Stasi.

Ange: I know what I'm doing.

Ange: Let's go back to the apartment and wait for Light to get back to us.

AN-94: ...

AN-94 seems to have noticed something. She walks over to Ange.

AN-94: Be careful.

Ange: ...Thanks.

Ange leans on AN-94's arm as she makes it down the stairs slowly.

...

The following day.

Having recovered more energy, Ange undergoes a rigorous vetting process and finally makes it into the interrogation room that Light has arranged.

Light stands outside the door and looks at Ange with some concern.

Light: Are you sure you don't wish to be accompanied?

Ange: Yes, just wait here with DEFY.

Ange: ...Also, well done. You've been very efficient.

Light: My application went through very fast... Almost unsettlingly fast.

Light: This kind of application usually takes a few days to be approved.

Light's words are dripping with implication, but Ange ignores it altogether.

AK-12: Sometimes it's best not to ask too many questions.

AK-12: It won't do you any good, Mr. Light.

Ange: ...

Upon entering the dingy interrogation room on her own, Powell's loathsome face comes into view once more.

Ange settles down quickly and initiates the conversation under Powell's watchful gaze.

Ange: Good morning, Mr. Powell.

Powell: ...Stop beating around the bush, Miss Angelia.

Powell purses his plump, pouty lips, trying to appear tough.

But Ange can spot the beads of sweat forming on his forehead with just a glance.

Ange pulls out a chair and sits down opposite Powell.

Ange: They didn't strip you of your suit? I didn't expect a preacher from Bremen to command such respect even in Berlin.

Powell: Humph... I wouldn't have come this far without a few friends.

Powell's gaze wanders around the room. He dabs at his clammy forehead with the handkerchief in his cuffed hands from time to time.

Ange: And yet your friends are still keeping you locked up in here.

Ange: I hear Leone gets to sleep on a soft mattress in some luxurious lodgings. Any idea why?

Powell: Don't bother. I've told the Stasi everything I know.

Powell: You're wasting your time here.

Ange: I knew you were going to say that, but I just don't believe you.

Ange: A wily old fox such as yourself must've saved a card up your sleeve. Even now, you still think everything is under your control.

Ange: When in fact, you're not in the game anymore.

Powell: H-How dare you?!

Ange must have struck a nerve, as Powell slammed his hands on the desk all of a sudden.

Powell: You know nothing about me, bitches!

Powell: Soon I'll be out of here, then I'll make everyone pay for this!

Ange: ...

Ange pinches the bridge of her nose and shakes her head. She rises from her chair.

Powell: W...What are you doing?

Powell: We're not done yet. Are you leaving?

Powell seems to think Ange got up to take her leave and starts panicking.

Ange: Ah, so you DO understand your situation.

Ange: Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you refuse to cooperate?

Ange: Now you're scared.

Powell: S...Scared? Me? You must be kidding!

Powell: You're the one begging me for information, agent... So fix your attitude!

Ange: Huh...

Ange: Light, turn off the CCTV.

Powell: ...What's the big idea?

Sensing danger, Powell eyes Ange warily.

But Ange doesn't answer. She just circles around to his back.

Powell: I'm warning you! If I—

Slam!

In just a second, before Powell can even finish his sentence, his head is slammed heavily against the metal surface of the desk.

Powell: Gah!

Ange then jerks his head back by his hair, causing him to squeal like a pig.

Powell: You bitch! Let go of me... Oh god! Please, I beg you!

Ange: I've dealt with too many pieces of shit like you.

Ange: I know how easy it is to break you.

Slam!

Slam!

Slam!

Grabbing him by the head, Ange slams him against the desk a few more times.

The skin on Powell's forehead quickly breaks and his entire face is soon covered in blood and gore.

Powell: Ah... Argh!

Ange: I don't have time to waste on garbage.

Ange's slightly hoarse voice sounds no different from a devil's murmur to Powell.

Ange: Tell me—who pulled Leone out and why? What does Leone have on her?!

Powell: I'll tell you! For heaven's sake, I'll tell you everything!

Powell: Let go!

Thunk!

Ange thrusts Powell's head onto the desk one last time before swaggering back to her chair.

Powell sobs and whimpers as he slowly lifts his head. He has long since lost hold of his handkerchief, and there's nothing with which to clean the blood off his face.

Powell: I don't know who it was, but I know why they did it.

Ange: Why?

Powell: Because of her research.

Powell: Before you trashed the Flora Institute, Leone's research had reached a critical stage.

Powell: That person was after Leone's tech, but she refused to share anything but the formulation of the hallucinogen...

Ange: Humph... So I actually did her a favor.

Ange: Leone doesn't have much choice under these circumstances.

Ange: This is part of her plan.

Ange: What else do you know? What is her research about?

Powell: I don't know the details, but it's definitely about some kind of weapon of mass destruction.

Ange: There are many weapons of mass destruction in the world, why are they so interested in Leone's?

Ange: What's so special about it?

Powell: I only know what I know because I was given the opportunity to use it, but even so...

Powell: All I know is that the substance is very easy to conceal and virtually undetectable by any kind of device.

Powell: It's perfect for...

Ange: ...Terrorist attacks.

Powell: Yes, it can be easily delivered to anywhere.

Powell: Just imagine—if I could get a dirty bomb inside the Chancellor's residence...

Powell: What would be beyond my reach? Who wouldn't fear me?!

His pain must have started to subside, because Powell has regained some of his usual insolence.

His teeth are dyed red by his blood, but he's still cackling at his own little fantasy.

Whoosh!

Ange jumps to her feet.

Powell: !

Ange's abrupt movement sends Powell cowering again.

Powell: That's all I know!

Ange: "Planning something big in Berlin..." Dammit, it can't be!

She pays him no mind.

Instead, she places both hands on the desk and mutters to herself with a deep, ponderous frown.

Ange: No... Just knowing isn't enough. I have no evidence.

Powell watches Ange's strange behavior and carefully loosens up, seeing that she doesn't seem to have any intention of hitting him.

After some hesitation, he sniffs.

Powell: I can see that you're still missing one last card in your hand.

Ange: You got any friendly advice?

Powell: I'd hardly call it friendly... Not for a crazy bitch like you...

Powell realizes his mistake the moment the derogatory term slips out, and his voice trails off.

But he refuses to take back what he just said. His face flushes red in either fear or indignation.

Ange stares at him patiently—she won't inflict any more violence on him because she's already got what she wanted.

Powell: Let's make a deal.

Ange: A deal?

Powell: I have a lead...which will definitely be useful to you.

Powell: If you can guarantee my safety, I could...

Ange: Just spit it out.

Ange: You may not even live to regret not making a deal with me while you still can.

Powell opens his mouth and pauses. But as he returns Ange's gaze, he understands that his options are limited. He grits his teeth and fishes out a cigarette case from his pocket.

Ange: What's this?

Ange takes the case and opens it. Inside is a small vial.

Powell: Every prison has its own smuggler, and Berlin Prison is no exception.

Powell: Tobacco, whisky, posters of hot chicks... Where there's a demand, there's a supply; I'm sure you understand.

Ange: Most wardens turn a blind eye to this kinda stuff, sometimes because of bribe, sometimes just to keep the peace... But drugs—that's where they draw the line.

Powell: No, this is no ordinary drug. Obviously not.

Powell: How else would I be able to get it in?

Ange: So what is it?

Powell: You still remember the substance I used in Bremen?

Powell: The one that I got from Leone.

Ange: ...The hallucinogen?

Powell: I have friends in Berlin Prison as well. Word has it...

Powell: This has become all the rage lately.

Powell: A hallucinogen? Being circulated in prison?

Powell: I don't know what it means and I have no interest in finding out.

Powell: But I've given you the lead...now keep up your end of the bargain!

Ange: ...

Ange weighs the cigarette case in her palm and pockets it.

Ange: ...

Ange: ...Who else have you told about this?

Powell: Just you.

Powell: I didn't even know when the Stasi interrogated me.

Powell: So the only ones who know about this are you and me.

Powell: Of course, there's no telling if anyone involved in the smuggling business would let it slip, but that's beyond my control.

Ange: Don't tell another soul.

Ange: I will remember this favor.

Part 5: Heraclitus' River II

5

...

AK-12: Ange? How did it go?

Ange: I'll fill you in on the way.

RPK-16: You don't look too happy.

Light: Did you find out anything new?

Ange: Nothing useful.

Ange: He's been pretty much squeezed dry by your colleagues.

Light: ...

Light raises an eyebrow. He opens his mouth to say something but then changes his mind.

Once they are out of the building, Ange hastens back to the apartment.

AK-15 speaks up all of a sudden.

AK-15: Ange.

Ange: What?

AK-15: We are being followed.

Ange: ...

Ange: Shake them off.
Part 6: HR II - Bottom Radar

6

...

Ange: ...First of all, we must trace the source of this drug.

Ange: 12, go and get a line on who's been peddling prohibited goods in prison.

AK-12: Isn't it better to let the actual townie handle this?

AK-12: I mean the whelp.

Ange: He doesn't even know I've got my hands on this vial.

Ange: Now cut the crap. This is a piece of cake for you. I want results in two hours.

AK-12: Alright, alright, leave it to me.

Ange: Well?

AK-12: Yep, piece of cake. The Berlin underworld network is transparent like glass.

AK-12: There are four people smuggling goods into the prison, two of which have gone missing since a while ago.

AK-12: Coincidentally, two new players have taken their places, and as far as I know, the other two have no objections about that.

Ange: Whoever has any objections is now dead.

Ange: Brutal, but simple... AK-15, take over from here. This shouldn't be a problem for you, right?

AK-15: I'll handle it.
Part 7: HR II - Left Radar

7

...

Ange: ...Is this supposed to be the slum in Berlin?

AK-12: The conditions are even better than some regular residential areas in Bremen.

AK-12: The standard of living really varies from city to city.

Ange: 15, what have you got so far?

Ange: ...What's this bloodstain on the floor?

AK-15: He refused to talk unless I offered him something in return.

AK-12: Well, clearly you've made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

Ange: So what have you learned?

AK-15: These two are definitely the source of the hallucinogen circulating in the prison.

AK-15: But they are not the first consignors. They have to report to their superior whenever they receive and distribute a consignment.

AK-15: This superior apparently never deals with them in person.

AK-12: Apparently?

AK-15: I found him.

Ange: Good job.

Ange: Notify RPK. Prepare to move out.

AK-15: Understood.
Part 8: Cracks (side)

8

...

Shadowless: ...The government's refusal to address the citizens' protests is met with further dissatisfaction.

Shadowless: Today, a demonstration in Neuhammer escalated into violence, and two Berlin police officers...

Light: ...

The door opens.

Light: Dinner is in the fridge.

Shadowless: Thanks.

Shadowless: What are you watching?

Shadowless flings her leather handbag onto the sofa and makes her way to the fridge. She takes out a bottle of well-chilled beer.

Light: The news.

Shadowless sips her beer and gazes at the television screen thoughtfully with an elbow on Light's head.

Shadowless: My hair was curling a bit funny, don't you think?

Light: I thought you'd quit drinking?

Shadowless: I only drink non-alcoholic beer after work.

Light: That's fine, and you've been working out.

Light: But still, make sure you stay safe.

Light: You were there at the riot the day before yesterday, weren't you?

Shadowless: Are you teaching me how to do my job?

Shadowless whacks Light lightly on the head.

Shadowless: If I were afraid of taking risks, I would just be holed up in my office, typing away.

Shadowless: This is what it means to be a news correspondent. If you're really worried about me, then quit that nasty job of yours and join me!

Shadowless: I can create an opening for you anytime!

Light: ...You know that's not possible.

Light: We've discussed this many times.

Shadowless: Humph...

Shadowless goes over to sit on the sofa, deliberately putting some distance between Light and herself.

Shadowless: You were at the sanatorium during the day, weren't you?

Light: No.

Light's denial slips out as he finds himself confronted by Shadowless' accusing eyes.

Shadowless: You think you can fool me?

Shadowless: I'm warning you—go talk to Kevin. It doesn't matter who's in charge of this case as long as it's not you; I don't want you anywhere near it.

Light: Why?

Shadowless: It's too dangerous.

Shadowless puts down her beer on the coffee table.

Just then, the news on TV starts showing footages of the riot.

Shadowless: Idunn is a honeypot. The government and many major corporations all have their eyes on it.

Shadowless: You're only 19, why are you getting involved in this? Are you so eager to throw away your life?

Boom!

An explosion goes off on TV, filling in the silence.

Light: Are we really having a debate about who has the more dangerous job here?

Shadowless: I'm not joking.

Light: Me neither, sis.

Light picks up the remote control and turns off the television.

Light: Here's some advice from an insider—don't dig too deep.

Light: This isn't something the media should look into. Back off or you'll get in trouble.

Shadowless: Light!

Shadowless calls out to Light, who has got to his feet. She looks almost pained.

Shadowless: ...You don't have to risk your own life for Mother's work.

Light: This is my choice, sister.

Light: I hope you can understand... If you can't...

He pauses for a moment.

Light: It would make me sad.

With a shake of his head, Light leaves the living room and retreats into his bedroom.

The beer on the table is still bubbling, but Shadowless no longer has the appetite for it.
Part 9: Heraclitus' River III

9

...

Back in the apartment.

Ange places the vial on the table and studies it intently.

AK-12: I could tell from your face that you haven't returned empty-handed.

AK-12 has snuck up quietly behind her.

Ange: Where are the others?

AK-12: I have 94 watching the whelp. 15 and 16 are on the lookout.

AK-12: You don't want him to take part in what's coming up?

Ange: That's because I'm about to cross the line.

Ange: If he finds out, things will get messy.

AK-12: What's the plan?

Ange: First of all, I must track down whoever's slinging this.

Ange: According to Powell, this thing is in ample supply, so there must be more.

Ange: Whoever the supplier is, they must've left traces.

AK-12: What's this?

Ange: The same stuff we encountered in Bremen, remember? Hallucinogen à la Leone.

Ange: But all of Leone's and Powell's stocks should've been seized by the Stasi when they were arrested.

AK-12: So either there is another source...

AK-12: Or they still have spies in the Stasi.

AK-12: Which do you think is more probable?

Ange: ...I know for a fact that Leone and Powell didn't hold all the stock.

Ange: But do you see the implication of such flagrant circulation of this illicit substance within Berlin Prison?

Ange: Who do you think I can trust, 12?

Ange taps the armrest on her chair, her voice wavering sightly.

AK-12: Me, 94, 15, 16, and the Griffin Commander.

Ange: ...

AK-12: You're not alone in this fight, Ange.

AK-12: Relax. You're being too hard on yourself.

Ange: I know...

Click.

Call connected.

Commander: Ange?

Ange: Good afternoon, Commander.

Ange: I hope you have good news for me?

Commander: Well...I don't know if this counts as good news.

Commander: I do have a new lead, but it points toward a tragedy that's poised to happen.

Ange: Just "poised to happen"; not "already happened"—I'll take that as good news.

Ange: Go ahead, what's this about?

Commander: Remember the Earl said William is planning something big in Berlin? I have an inkling of what that may be.

Ange: An inkling?

Commander: William is possibly planning to detonate a dirty bomb in Berlin.

Commander: I saw an image of the aftermath - the entire city covered in Epiphylla.

Commander: Dandelion also believes that this is the desired effect of a certain "plan".

Ange: ...A dirty bomb?

Ange: Are you certain? It's impossible even for William to get something like that into Berlin.

Commander: I'm not sure, but there is evidence to support this conjecture.

Commander: The specific implementation and timeframe are still unclear and under investigation.

Commander: I just think you should know about this.

Ange: Right, got it... You're starting to sound like that old geezer.

Ange: And how are things going with Morridow? Have you obtained any new information from her?

Commander: Mo...you mean Machlian?

Commander: ...Nothing so far.

Commander: I'm working on it.

Ange: If it's not working out, just send her over to me before it's too late.

Ange: I have more ways than one to make her talk.

Commander: No, it's okay, I can handle it.

Ange: Fine.

Ange: ...Say, did something happen?

Ange: You seem kinda out of it.

Commander: Me? No...I'm perfectly fine.

Ange: Don't try to fool me, you should know better.

Ange: Or do you not trust me?

Commander: That's not it!

Commander: (Sighs) ...It's just...um...

Commander: Kalina, my adjutant, spent too long in the Red Zone...

Ange: ELID?

Commander: Yeah.

Ange: ...I'm sorry.

Ange: Is it serious?

Commander: It's not too bad at the moment; still only in the early stages. I'm just worried about the allocation of medical... No, forget it.

Ange: Don't worry, that young lady is a strong one. If she had enlisted, she would have done at least as well as me.

Ange: She'll pull through.

Commander: Yeah, thanks.

Ange: Right, I've got stuff to do.

Ange: Till next time.

Commander: Okay, bye.

Click.

Call ended.

AK-12: What a nightmare.

AK-12: The competent Miss Kalina succumbed at a time like this?

AK-12: No wonder she wasn't there at the pub.

Ange: ...

Ange closes her eyes. She suddenly clutches at her chest and bends down.

AK-12: Ange...?

Ange: ...

AK-12: Ange!

Ange: ...12?

AK-12: Ange?

Ange: ...I'm fine.

Ange clenches her fist. Her hand is clammy with sweat.

Ange: If what the Commander says is true, then everything unusual that's happening could be a prelude to the oncoming attack.

Ange: The Earl...wasn't lying.

AK-12: You think the attack is going to happen?

Ange: Why not? This also corresponds to the leads we currently have.

Ange: You heard the Commander. The image is the aftermath of a dirty bomb explosion, with Epiphylla blooming.

Ange: Who has the means to transport a dirty bomb into the heart of Berlin?

Ange: It can only be Leone's new technology... I don't know what exactly it is yet, but it must have something to do with Epiphylla.

Ange: This must be what Gray is planning.

AK-12: That does make sense. Then the woman is the key to the whole conspiracy?

Ange: Has Leone given her the tech yet?

Ange: ...We have to let the Earl get rid of her before she starts putting the plan into motion.

Ange: The Earl wants evidence, so we'll give him evidence.

Ange inhales deeply to ease the tightness in her chest.

Ange: We must track down the supplier of this hallucinogen. You and 94... No, have 94 watch that kid. Get 15 and 16 to help you look into who's smuggling the drug into the prison.

AK-12: Understood.

Ange: ...William wants to play an epic game of chess.

Ange: So, I'm overturning his chessboard.

Ange: I will never let him get what he wants.

...
Part 10: The Grain of Millet I

10

...

Under the cover of night, a truck driving along a muddy road emerges from the woods on the outskirts of the city.

Smuggler: Verdammt...

The heavy truck lurches as it goes over a bump on the road. The driver curses.

Fortunately, he won't have to make this blasted trip again for the rest of the week.

The truck slowly comes to a halt in front of a white building. This three-storey warehouse is surrounded by walls on all sides with electrified security fences on top. CCTV cameras are in every corner, leaving no blind spots.

This facility may be remote and secluded, but whoever thinks of burgling this place has to be insane.

The smuggler chuckles to himself at this amusing thought. But then he remembers his task and hurriedly honks his horn.

Smuggler: I've brought the goods!

Clatter...

At the sound of his horn, the gates slowly open.

???: ...

The familiar black-clad girl glides out from within.

The smuggler opens his door and jumps off the truck. He rolls his neck to relax his stiff muscles.

No matter how many times he's seen her, he is struck by her unusual prosthetics... But he knows better than to ask questions.

Smuggler: The quantity of this consignment is rather large. Give me a heads-up next time, okay?

???: ...Is it all here?

Smuggler: Yes, all of it.

???: Then cease the deliveries for the time being.

???: We will get in touch when we have need of your service again.

???: You may go.

Smuggler: Tsk...

They have been working together for quite some time, but this girl in black is as cold and unfriendly as ever.

To corporates like her, he's probably about as insignificant as a piece of rock on the ground.

Smuggler: I'll have to raise the price next time!

Smuggler: Delivering such dangerous stuff to the prison is a very high-risk job!

Anxious to leave this spooky place, the smuggler returns to his truck.

Rumble...

The engine comes to life, and the truck slowly drives away in the direction from which it came.

???: ...

The black-clad girl⁠—or rather, the Nyto⁠—follows the truck's departure with her eyes. Then she checks the surroundings one last time before retreating behind the walls.

The gates close once again.

Pzzt⁠—

However, the moment she enters the building, an electric fence on the walls suddenly gives off a spark before being deactivated.

Whoosh⁠—

A nimble figure steps onto the wall, vaults over the fence, and lands on the other side.

Three other figures repeat the same motions, all with practiced and nonchalant ease.

???: Surveillance system is jammed.

???: No active units detected.

???: Good. Advance.

In a hidden corner, the conspiratorial whispers fade into the shadows along with these figures.

...

AK-12: No unusual activity in the left wing.

AK-15: No unusual activity in the right wing.

RPK-16: Breaking into their security system.

Ange: ...Did you see that at the gates?

AK-15: It was a Nyto.

AK-12: She didn't even bother to hide her prosthetics. I honestly don't know what to say.

AK-12: Aren't they concerned about being recognized?

Ange: Only very few smugglers have channels into Berlin Prison, and even fewer have the means to deliver hallucinogens.

Ange: They seem awfully careless with such valuable assets.

RPK-16: They probably kill these smugglers after one or two deliveries and give the job to someone new.

RPK-16: Their business model will only give them a bad name in the Berlin underground black market.

RPK-16: But they don't seem to have a shortage of slingers, so either the local gangs are really that stupid, or the orchestrator behind the scenes is in charge of the black market itself.

AK-15: This building is owned by Galatea Corporation.

AK-15: More specifically...by Gray.

Ange: Every clue leads back to her... Looks like we can raise the net soon.

Ange: Can we enter the building?

RPK-16: The security system is very sophisticated. I can loop the CCTV cameras and turn off the alarms, but the rest is up to you.

AK-15: You shouldn't have come with us. You should've stayed at the apartment with 94.

Ange: 94 is perfectly capable of watching the kid on her own.

Ange: If I'd stayed, I'd have to deal with his questions about your whereabouts.

Ange: Besides...I won't rest easy until I've seen the results with my own eyes.

AK-12: Just to make it clear... What we're about to do is absolutely illegal.

AK-12: Depending on the outcome, it could greatly jeopardize your position.

Ange: Not my problem. The Earl would have to sort it out.

Ange: As long as we have the evidence, he can lock this place down.

Ange: He'd better be prepared for such contingencies if he wants something from me.

AK-12: I'm surprised Zelinsky even put up with you for so long.

RPK-16: The emergency exit is open.

AK-12: Then it's a go. Remember to keep your weapons loaded.

AK-12: And you, Ange, stay behind me and don't do anything rash.

Ange: ...Let's go.

...
Part 11: The Grain of Millet II

11

Inside the warehouse, the black-clad Nyto who has just met with the smuggler is walking down an aisle.

On both sides, white soldiers are loading crates of formulations onto conveyor belts in an orderly fashion.

The Nyto passes through the files of soldiers and arrive before a Nyto in white at the end of the aisle.

White Nyto: Well?

Nyto: That man has outlived his usefulness.

White Nyto: And the replacement?

Nyto: The Doctor will send him over soon.

White Nyto: The next batch is to be delivered to Narciss.

White Nyto: Handle it in person.

Nyto: Understood.

The black Nyto nods. Then she looks up at the white Nyto.

Nyto: How much longer do we have to work here?

White Nyto: ...

The white Nyto makes no effort to answer the black Nyto's query.

She gazes at her silently, takes two steps closer, and tilts her head up with a hand.

Nyto: ...?

The black Nyto is puzzled by the gesture, but she obviously finds it unnerving.

Then...

Slap!

The white Nyto smacks her squarely across the face, sending her rolling across the floor.

White Nyto: I did not give you permission to ask questions...

White Nyto: ...So keep your mouth shut.

Nyto: I'm sorry...

The black Nyto scrambles back onto her feet and keeps her head bowed in repentance.

White Nyto: Operation Cocoon takes precedence over everything else.

White Nyto: Since Morridow has ordered us to aid the Doctor...

White Nyto: That's what we'll do.

White Nyto: Do you intend to defy Father?

Nyto: N-No...

While the white Nyto is admonishing the other Nyto, their internal comms suddenly go off.

White Nyto: ...!

Nyto: ...!

The two Nytos freeze for a second before turning to look in the other direction.

Noticing their movement, all the white soldiers also put down the merchandise they've been handling and pick up their weapons.

White Nyto: Intruders!

White Nyto: Eliminate them!

...
Part 12: The Grain of Millet III

12

Boom!

AK-12: Ange!!

...

Blazing fire engulfs the darkness of night.

Ange's already frayed nerves are further strained by the spots dancing in her vision and the ringing in her ears caused by the impact, but she is otherwise largely unharmed.

Ange: ...AK-12?

Her subordinate's face appear before her eyes.

The last time she saw AK-12 looking so weak and shaken was when she fought that man.

AK-12: Deep breaths, Ange. Deep breaths.

Ange: 12? You...

AK-12: Ange, look at me.

AK-12: Do you remember what happened?

Ange: I...

The memories start coming back to her.

Ange: We were exchanging fire with Paradeus.

Ange: I saw you and AK-15 pinning down the Paradeus troops in the warehouse.

Ange: Then RPK-16 and I killed the black Nyto together.

Ange: After that...

Ange recalls the dazzling flash of light.

Ange: ...After that, the white Nyto blew up the warehouse.

Ange: You dove on top of me and carried me out through the window.

AK-12: Good, looks like you've got all your marbles.

Ange: But you...

That's when Ange notices the rough shape that AK-12 seems to be in.

She looks terrible.

AK-12: Don't worry, I'm fine. Just a few mangled components jamming my joints...

AK-12: I need emergency repairs... It's hard to move.

Ange: ...

Ange wriggles out of AK-12's arms and gets to her feet rather unsteadily.

Before her, what was once a white building has been reduced to a pile of rubble.

All those formulations being loaded into crates are now nothing but dust.

Boom!

A tall figure suddenly gets up from the ground.

All the broken bricks, tiles, and dirt fall off to reveal...

AK-15.

RPK-16, who was shielded underneath her, seems to be uninjured, albeit a bit rumpled.

Ange: ...RPK, perform emergency repairs on 12.

RPK-16: No can do. Even I can't tear out her broken parts with my bare hands.

RPK-16: But don't worry, I'm sure the iron-willed AK-12 will hold out just fine.

AK-12: When I can stand on my legs again, killing you will be the first thing I do.

AK-15: ...Do you need spare parts? You can take some from me.

AK-12: That would be counterproductive.

AK-12: We cannot afford to undermine your performance in battle—that could prove fatal for Ange.

AK-12: Just get me back to the apartment. 94 has the necessary tools.

Ange: ...Where's the Nyto?

AK-15 scans the surroundings and shakes her head.

AK-15: Gone.

AK-15: I'm not seeing her remains, so she must have fled.

Ange: She escaped?

Ange: Tsk... Why?

AK-12: I don't know, but shouldn't we also retreat?

AK-12: We're in no condition to initiate a pursuit.

Ange: You're right. Besides, we've already got what we're after.

Ange lets out a long sigh.

Ange: Investigate the scene and gather all the clues.

Ange: Once we pass them over to the Earl, we'll have enough evidence to accuse Gray.

RPK-16: Provided that...we can actually make it back.

Ange: What?

Ange's query is cut off by the sudden wail of ear-splitting sirens.

In the blink of an eye, people in police and security uniforms swarm in from all directions.

They are all armed and making a beeline for Ange.

Security Guard: Don't move!

Police Officer: Drop your weapons!

They move in quickly, and without any obstacles around, Ange can only watch as they soon have her firmly surrounded.

AK-15 and RPK-16, still holding onto their weapons, fall back to protect Ange's flanks.

AK-15 is radiating so much murderous rage that most of the security guards aim straight at her subconsciously.

Ange: ...

No, this isn't right.

There's nothing "subconscious" about this. They are clearly hostile and have an obvious target.

It's only natural that an explosion would draw the attention of the authorities.

But there is private security personnel among this group.

They're working together.

What does this signify?

Gray: We meet again under strange circumstances.

Gray: Miss Angelia.

Ange: ...You.

Someone Ange absolutely dreads to see appears before her.

The mixed group of security guards and police officers part like the Red Sea before Moses, leaving a path for Gray to saunter along towards Ange.

Gray: Well, don't just stand there. Search the scene.

Before engaging Ange in conversation, Gray waves to disperse the troops gathered around.

Except for a small group still holding Task Force DEFY at gunpoint, the others scatter at Gray's command.

They cordon off the site of the explosion and start cleaning up the remains. They work in an orderly fashion and perfect coordination with each other.

Ange: Wait!

Ange: Those are...

Security Guard: Stop!

Ange wants to intervene, but several security guards next to Gray stop her in her tracks with raised weapons.

AK-15 steps in front of Ange and glares threateningly at them, but they don't seem at all intimidated by her impressive stature.

Ange: Dammit...

Ange watches helplessly as these people gather up all the remaining formulations and a few unrecognizable corpses—her hard-earned clues and evidence.

It has been an unexpected turn of events, but even Ange understands why Gray is here.

Ange: Destroying evidence, are you?

Gray: Evidence?

Gray's brow furrows in apparent confusion.

She eyes the ruins and glances at the security guards around her.

Security Guard: There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding, Miss Angelia.

Security Guard: This is a Galatea storage facility for experimental articles.

Security Guard: There's nothing but Idunn serums here.

The guard standing next to Gray speaks up sternly at her signal.

Ange: Who's that going to fool?

Gray: I don't know. Who do you think?

Gray smiles meaningfully.

Gray: Trust the Berlin Police's judgment, Miss Angelia.

Gray: ...Your government will never betray you.

Ange: This isn't my government. Besides...the police?

Ange snorts and glares at Gray, whose face is illuminated by the dying flames.

Ange: This place is over six kilometers away from the city with no direct transport access.

Ange: How could the Berlin Police arrive so quickly?

Ange: Not to mention there's such amazing teamwork between these "police" and your mercenaries. They're all working for you.

Ange lifts her chin defiantly, and her Dolls take another step forward. The standoff grows increasingly touch-and-go.

Ange: ...You aren't even bothering to play innocent.

Ange: In other words, you don't plan on letting me leave, do you?

AK-15: ...

AK-15's eyes flicker dangerously. Her weapon is trained directly on Gray.

AK-12: 15... Stay calm.

AK-12's low murmur halts AK-15's finger, which is poised to pull her trigger any second.

RPK-16: ...Don't worry, 12.

RPK-16: 15 isn't prone to rashness.

But even as she says that, RPK-16 directs her gaze towards Gray.

RPK-16: If there is an exchange of fire, it will be very difficult for us to defend Ange. After all, there's nothing that can give us cover.

RPK-16: But that's true for you too, you know?

RPK-16: At this distance, 15 can easily break your neck in the blink of an eye.

Security Guard: Come again?!

RPK-16's provocation has triggered the wrath of the armed security guard. He roars as he charges forward, but his advance is blocked by AK-15.

Conflict seems ready to break out any moment, but no one dares make a move before the two key players give the order.

Gray: I'll try my luck.

Gray grins as she meets RPK-16's gaze.

Ange: Do you think you can actually get away with this?

Gray: You're toying with Pandora's Box, Angelia.

Gray: I could indulge your little mischief...but you made this choice.

Ange eyes this woman coldly and can almost smell her brazen contempt.

At this distance... If she draws her pistol quickly enough, she could at least...

???: Wait!

Just then, a familiar voice shouts from another entrance.

Then a completely different force rushes in.

Gray lifts her head and her men are immediately on the alert.

Light: Miss Angelia is an important collaborator of the Stasi.

Light: Neither the Berlin Police nor Galatea has the authority to detain her.

Light: I'm taking over the situation from here!

The young man strides up to Ange and Gray and flashes his identifications as he approaches.

Behind him, AN-94 heads straight over to the collapsed AK-12 with a toolkit.

She performs emergency repairs on AK-12 wordlessly and soon enough, AK-12's dull eyes light up again.

AN-94: Core components are undamaged. You can move now, 12.

AK-12: Good. Give me my rifle.

AK-12: I'm gonna gun down this pompous woman.

AK-12 struggles to her feet but is held down by both AN-94 and Ange.

Gray: ...Young man, has your little operation been authorized?

Gray narrows her eyes at Light, who has wedged himself between her and Ange. Her tone is dripping with menace.

Light: Of course. I have the warrant right here. As I said, I'm now taking over here.

Light: Mrs. Gray, please cooperate with our investigation.

Gray: Humph...

Gray waves her hand and her men files off in an orderly manner.

With their scavenged remnants, obviously.

Light: ...Please leave those behind.

Security Guard: Don't go too far, Stasi!

Security Guard: You have no right to seize Galatea's property.

Security Guard: Ask your superior to haul his ass here!

Security Guard: Otherwise, mind your own business.

Light: ...

Realizing that this is as far as he can push it, Light backs up a step and beckons for the other agents to enter the site of the explosion.

Light: May I confirm that an attack has taken place here?

Gray: Incidents like this were rather common in Berlin in the last few months.

Gray: But it's hard to believe that these rioters are nefarious enough to raise a hand against Galatea.

Gray: However, this company will not bow down to terrorism of any kind.

Gray: Idunn will be launched on schedule... You can relay that to your friend, little agent.

Light falls silent for a moment before bowing slightly to Gray.

Light: I understand.

Light: Miss Ange, let's go.

Ange: ...

Ange helps AK-12 up. She looks up and meets Gray's eyes.

Gray: Count yourself lucky.

Ange: Don't think this is over yet.

After watching Ange leave under the Stasi's protection, Gray turns around and takes in the scene of devastation.

Gray: ...We're leaving too.

Gray: There's nothing left here.

With that, Galatea's troops march out of the facility.
Part 13: Night Festival (side)

13

...

After departing from the storage facility, Galatea's convoy drives on along the bumpy road.

But instead of returning to the city, it is headed for somewhere even more remote.

It travels beyond the quarantine wall and out of the decontamination zone.

When it reaches a stretch of no man's land, it finally comes to a halt.

Security Guard: Mrs. Gray, we're here.

Gray: ...

(Rustles)

Security Guard: ...!

The sudden movement immediately puts the security guards on alert.

A large amount of white soldiers emerge from behind obstacles without warning and have Gray and her entourage completely surrounded.

Security Guard: Who are you?!

Nyto: ...

...A cyborg girl garbed in white walks up slowly from among the white troops.

Security Guard: D-Don't come any closer!

The security guards, deeply unnerved by the mysterious and creepy troops, raise their weapons.

Gray: ...

However, their charge, Mrs. Gray, strides out from behind the defensive barrier formed by the guards.

Security Guard: Hold... Mrs. Gray! Watch out!

One of the guards call out in alarm at the sight of their delicate-looking superior facing down the girl armed with a scythe.

But what happens next catches him completely by surprise.

Smack!

Mrs. Gray slaps the girl heavily across the face.

Gray: ...Why was Angelia at the factory?

Nyto: I'm sorr...

Smack!

Another slap, this time with the back of her hand.

Gray: Imbecile.

Gray's menacing face and spine-chilling voice make the security guards wonder if they are hallucinating.

Gray: If I hadn't been notified in time, do you know what would've happened because of your blunder?

Nyto: ...

Gray: You have marred my immaculate plan with a speckle of dust.

Gray: Will you bear full responsibility if this angers Father?

Nyto: ...I will.

Gray eyes the white Nyto for a while and finally reverts to her usual soft-spoken countenance.

Gray: I expect as much.

Gray: ...Now get to work.

Nyto: Understood.

The white Nyto nods and shifts her gaze towards the Galatea forces behind Gray.

Security Guard: Mrs. Gray... What is the meaning of this?!

Nyto: ...Kill them all.

The white Nyto raises her scythe and utters her command softly.

Security Guard: What?!

The next moment, gunfire and screams erupt almost simultaneously.

Gray flicks the dust off her hem, not even sparing the men a glance.

Gray: Remember, before midnight.

Nyto: ...Do I need to retrieve the corpse?

Gray: ...

Angered once more by the Nyto's stupidity, Gray narrows her eyes and is about to punish her again, but then an idea occurs to her.

Her face smoothens.

Gray: Sure.

Gray: But don't bring it to me.

Gray: ...Deliver a surprise to Morridow.

Nyto: Yes, ma'am.

The white Nyto nods and looks up uncertainly at Gray.

She is fearful of incurring the latter's wrath again, but she still ventures a question cautiously.

Nyto: Can the mole you planted close to Angelia...

Nyto: ...be of use yet?

Gray: ...

Gray stares at the Nyto expressionlessly.

Only when the Nyto starts becoming nervous does she finally shake her head and turn away.

Gray: Not yet.

By then, the massacre is over, and the puddle of blood seeps up to Gray's feet.

The white troops sort through the bodies with great efficiency and start destroying all the goods on the trucks systematically.

Gray eyes the blood-splattered trucks with disgust and backs away.

Gray: Pandora's Box...shouldn't be opened lightly.

Nyto: Understood.

The white Nyto nods reverently.

Gray: Also, I need a car.

Nyto: ...Yes, ma'am.
Part 14: The Prisoner's Dilemma I

14

...

At Ange's accommodation in Berlin.

It's deep into the night, still two or three hours away from daybreak.

Ange and her subordinates are in varying states of disheveledness, but they have finally made it back.

From the moment they left the storage facility, Light has been following Ange without a word.

He silently escorts Ange, who is just as silent, all the way to the safe house.

Ange: ...

Light: ...

He shadows Ange's footsteps until they reach Ange's door. The other Stasi members have returned to their original posts, but Light seems intent on staying.

Ange comes to a halt in front of her door.

Ange: This will do.

Light: I will be staying here tonight—in the room next door.

Light sidesteps Ange's pointed remark expressionlessly.

Ange: What, worried that I'll go blow up another warehouse?

Light: Not at all.

Light: It's just that my elder sister has already gone to bed and I do not wish to disturb her.

Ange: Oh? You have a sister? Is she also in the Stasi?

Light: ...No, she's a reporter.

Ange: A reporter?

Light: Indeed.

Ange gazes at Light, her hand still resting on the door handle.

Light returns her gaze evenly. He doesn't plan on letting Ange out of his sight until she has entered through the door.

Considering what just happened...Ange has nothing to say about that.

She pauses for a long while before finally letting go of the door handle. She leans on her elbow against the door and decides to clear the air.

Ange: Look, I'm really sorry about tonight.

Ange: I acted without permission and caused you trouble.

Light: ...

Light blinks—he is not expecting this at all.

Angelia doesn't strike him...as someone who would ever apologize.

Light: No...it's alright.

Light: I know you don't trust me. That's completely understandable.

Light: I know what you've been through in Bremen.

Light: Paradeus has already infiltrated the top strata of German politics, now even Gray has proved to be unscrupulous.

Light: I cannot fault you for being cautious under such circumstances.

Ange raps her knuckles against the door while pondering what to say in response. Honestly, Light is not wrong about her—she isn't one to apologize.

She is not particularly good at it, but looking at this young man, she believes she owes him this much.

Ange: When that young woman first joined me, she was just like you.

Ange: Young, eager, ambitious. You remind too much of her.

Light: ...But I will never go against you or try to take your life on a plane.

Ange: Haha.

Ange: What, so you're a good boy?

Light: I don't think I'm particularly good.

Light: I often make my sister angry. To her, I'm a rebellious baby brother.

Ange: It's not always a bad thing to be a rebel. However, you shouldn't rebel just for the sake of it.

Ange grabs hold of the door handle again.

Ange: You saved us today. Thank you.

Ange: However, I will not stop relying on my judgment.

Light: I do have faith in your judgment.

Light: If you require my services, please just ask.

Ange: Now go get some rest. We have much to do tomorrow.

Ange enters her room.

Light: Goodnight, Miss Ange.

Seeing that Ange is safely inside her room, Light turns around and is ready to retire himself.

In the silent corridor, the overhead lamp seems dimmer than usual.

Light: ...

His Stasi colleagues are standing guard on the first and second floors.

This building has always been the accommodation of important foreign dignitaries, so the higher floors are almost never staffed.

Right now, apart from Ange and her Dolls, it's completely empty.

It's only normal that it's quiet.

Light grasps the handle on his own door and gently turns the lock.

...However, he can't shake off this odd feeling.

There is something unusual...about this silence today.

Light: Miss An—!

Light turns around in alarm and finds a figure towering over him.

Paradeus Soldier: —!

Thud!

...

Once inside her room, Ange isn't at all surprised to find AK-12 sitting next to the window.

AK-12: How unlike you to have a heart-to-heart with the young man.

AK-12: I'm almost touched.

Ange: Shouldn't you be standing guard outside with the others?

AK-12: I'm wounded and deserve some rest.

AK-12: Besides, I have a feeling you'd want to talk.

Ange: ...

Ange walks around AK-12 and draws the curtains before sitting down on the chair next to the bed.

AK-12: You're too tense.

Ange: Are you my psychotherapist now? I thought only RPK was into this sort of thing.

AK-12: I've studied up on analyzing human body language.

AK-12: You've always avoided windows, but you didn't tend to deliberately sit facing the door when we're around.

Ange: ...I can't tell if I'm in Berlin or Paradeus' den anymore.

Ange: Perhaps there's no distinction between the two.

AK-12: You need help, Ange.

AK-12: You can't topple Paradeus single-handedly.

AK-12: I'm not trying to put in a good word for the whelp, but he was referred to us by J and K.

AK-12: And if it hadn't been for him today, we would've met our end then and there.

Ange: I know... Light can be trusted, that much I can tell.

Ange: But as I've said before, his trustworthiness is moot because as long as there's a single spy working under him, I can't possibly let him in on our entire plan.

Ange: Unless he ditches everyone else.

AK-12: Worst case, you still have us. We may be called "DEFY", but we will never betray you.

AK-12: Oh, there's the Griffin Commander as well.

Ange: ...I'll give the matter of Light some more thought.

AK-12: That's more like it. That's the Ange I know.

Ange: Compared to Bremen, we have a much clearer objective this time.

Ange: I'm confident that we'll be able to find out William's plan by going after Gray.

Ange: This woman is the key.

AK-12: We mustn't let her succeed, no matter what she's after.

Ange: ...Indeed, we mustn't.

Ange: We cannot let him put his terrorist attack into action.

AK-12: Speaking of which, I was just going to ask if you...

...

AK-12 stops abruptly mid-sentence.

Ange: ...12?

AK-12: Enemy attack.

Crack!

AK-12: Ange, get down!

Bang bang bang!!

The window covered by the curtains is suddenly smashed by the massive intruder. Ange reflexively rolls across the bed to the other side and draws her pistol behind cover.

Bang!

But AK-12 has already swiftly slit the throat of the intruder.

Clang...

Ange: A projectile!

Boom!

Ange: (Wheezes)

Ange: Goddammit... Tear gas...

While Ange is scrambling to find a towel, her door is kicked open.

AK-12 trains her rifle on the door and is just about to pull the trigger...

Light: Miss Ange!

Light: (Coughs)

But it turns out to be Light, who is also on high alert.

His face splattered with blood, he is holding a small knife in one hand and a pistol in the other.

Light: Miss Ange, we have to move!

Light: We're under attack!

Ange: Oh, I'm not blind.

Ange spots the corpse of a Paradeus soldier lying just outside her door.

And the one that AK-12 has just disposed of... She's seen these units before.

Paradeus Strelets.

Dammit... She should've seen this coming.

That woman won't let her off the hook just like that.

Meanwhile, gunshots ring out around the corner down the corridor. Light retreats into Ange's room.

Ange: Where's RPK and the others?!

AK-12: I'm trying to reach them...

AK-12: Damn! Signal is being jammed!

Light: Same here. I can't call for support at all, and the alarm has been disabled.

Ange: Looks like I pissed her off big time.

Ange tuts and reloads her pistol.

Light: They aren't exactly being subtle about it, so even if comms are down, people will soon notice the commotion.

Light: We'll just have to hold out until reinforcements arrive!

AK-12: ...I'm afraid that's not true.

Light: What?

Crackle...

Ange: Incendiary bombs.

Ange: They're planning to burn me to death.

Heat comes crashing in from down the corridor. AK-12 tears off the curtains and watches out for possible attacks from outside the window.

She also hears the sound of crossfires coming from the lower floors.

Ange: Crap... The other agents are pinned down too...

AK-12: This bit of heat is nothing to me.

AK-12: But if you're dead, there's no point for me to live, is there?

Ange: At this rate...

Ange: In a matter of minutes, I'll either die of severe burns or hypoxia.

Light: I don't think you'll run out of oxygen, the window is open, after all... Hold on.

Light: Can't you escape through the window?

Ange: Just in case your brain got smoked, might I remind you that we're on the eighth floor?

Light: But if Miss AK-12 carries you, she can make it down a floor or two with the help of some tools, right?

Ange: What about you?

Light: They're here for you. If you get out, they'll go after you.

Light: I can make my own way out.

AK-12: Good idea. Unfortunately, I'm currently in no shape to execute such acrobatics.

AK-12: I think our enemies know that.

AK-12 grabs a glass off the table and tosses it out through the window.

Bang!

In the darkness of the night sky, the delicate glass explodes into smithereens.

AK-12: Ange will be dead the moment she pokes her head out.

Ange: Then we'll have to run the gauntlet down the corridor.

Ange: We must try to break through their blockade before the fire spreads up here.

Light: Understood. Miss AK-12 and I will spearhead our escape!

Ange: Are you mad? It'll take them less than two seconds to vaporize you!

Light: Which means I'll have a second!

Light: Your safety is our priority here, Miss Ange!

Ange: Don't be ridiculous!

AK-12: Wait, stop bickering!

AK-12: Something's down there!

Ange: What—?!

While Ange and Light are still arguing, they sense a massive impact underneath their feet.

The cracking concrete starts falling under gravity's pull, then the two humans follow suit before they can react.

Ange: (Coughs)

AK-12: What the hell?! Couldn't you think of a better idea?!

In the split second before landing, AK-12 grabs Ange and cushions her fall with her own body.

Her already damaged body produces an ominous crack.

Still in a daze, Ange hears AK-12's exasperated gripe, followed by another familiar voice.

RPK-16: To tell the truth, dear 12, no, I honestly couldn't.

RPK-16: They've cut off all access to the eighth floor. Besides, the fire is spreading quickly and I can't risk having Ange use the fire escape.

Ange: ...RPK? Where are 15 and 94?

RPK-16: There are Nytos and Paradeus death squads in the lower levels as well.

RPK-16: They're good at sneak attacks, which makes them rather tricky even for 15 and 94 together.

RPK-16: I reckoned those could be a diversion so I came up on my own, and sure enough.

Light: Ugh...

Light grips his foot and lets out a groan.

Ange: Light?! Are you alright?

Light: Uh... I'm not sure.

Rat-tat-tat...

RPK-16: I'd love to apologize, but this isn't really the time.

RPK-16: It's the quickest way I can think of to get you out.

RPK-16: The only drawback is how much attention it draws.

AK-12: The ONLY drawback? You're too lenient about your own tactic.

Light: Ugh...!

Light bites back the pain and gets to his feet. He stumbles immediately and collapses on the rubble again.

Ange: You don't look okay at all.

Light: I'm fi... No, you're right. I'm not fine.

Light: I must've twisted my ankle.

RPK-16: Uh-oh.

Ange: ...Can you walk?

Light: I can, but...I can't go with you.

Light: I'll just slow you down.

Light: Let's split up.

Ange: What are you talking about? I might as well be sending you to your death!

Light: Don't worry, it'll take more than that to kill me. After all, I'm the Stasi's "rising star".

Light: Besides, their target is you, so they'll most likely just ignore me.

Light flashes Ange a dazzling grin, though Ange has little patience for his charm under these circumstances.

Ange: You can dream of being a hero when you're actually asleep.

Ange: I'm not leaving you behind.

Light: I'd like to say the same to you, Miss Ange. This isn't the time for nonsensical sleep-talking.

Light: We don't have much time.

As if to lend weight to Light's statement, Paradeus fires more shots.

Black Nyto: Target located. Execute extermination.

AK-12: Here they come.

Ange: Dammit... Not giving us even a breather.

Ange: They're hell-bent on killing me.

Light: They have squads guarding the other end of the passage. They'll just pin us down if we force our way through.

AK-12: ...If we're to get Ange out of here...

AK-12: Someone will have to draw their fire.

RPK-16: Oh my, then I suppose it's time for our great squad leader to shine.

AK-12: That's right.

RPK-16: ...Wait, you're being serious?

AK-12: It is the only way.

RPK-16: In your current state?

RPK-16: You do know how that'll end for you, right?

AK-12: I'm not an idiot like you.

AK-12: Of course I know.

RPK-16: It isn't a bad idea, at least you won't be here to boss me around while we're in Berlin.

RPK-16: Though Ange will probably get lonely, don't you think?

Ange: You want to cover our retreat?

Ange: No way. I have no spare bodies for you right now!

AK-12: I'm smarter than the two of you combined.

AK-12: If I say there's no other way, there is no other way.

AK-12: Ange, I've told you many times—you must prioritize your own life.

AK-12: Don't get yourself killed because of a Doll.

AK-12: There are battlefields more worthy of your sacrifice.

Ange: ...

AK-12: RPK.

RPK-16: Hm? ...What are you sending me? Command authorizations?

RPK-16: I'm the new squad leader?

AK-12: For now.

AK-12: If anything happens to Ange, I don't give a damn about what Shaw has got to say.

AK-12: I will make you wish you could access your own base code.

RPK-16: ...I am terribly flattered.

Light: Miss AK-12 and I will draw the enemies in different directions.

Light: Once you make it out, the pressure on us will lessen immediately.

Light: If you want us to survive, flee as fast as you can.

Ange: But...

Light: Don't worry, I'll be fine.

Light: With Miss AK-12 drawing most of their fire, I'll do my best to stay alive.

RPK-16: Save your breath, Ange.

RPK-16: Look, they're volunteering as tributes.

RPK-16: Besides, even I can't think of a better way.

Ange: ...

RPK-16: ...I will get you safely to 15 and 94.

Ange: Fine. Let's go.

Ange sets her jaw and takes one last look at AK-12, who's bracing herself against the corner, and Light, who's sitting on a pile of rubble covered in dust but still smiling at her, before finally turning away and taking off with RPK-16.

Light: Miss AK-12, take my ammo.

Light tosses all his remaining magazines and micro-explosives to AK-12.

AK-12: What about you?

AK-12: They say people speak kindly as their death draws near. You're not planning to die here with me, are you?

Light: Of course not. I've simply come to the conclusion that I have a better chance of survival if you have these.

Light: I'm just going to sit right here. As long as Frau Ange makes it out or reinforcements arrive, they won't waste any effort on me.

AK-12: I see. You've got a decent head on your shoulders.

AK-12: Still, I might just sign off for a while.

Light: ...May we meet again in a brave new world, Miss AK-12.

AK-12: Cut the crap.

AK-12 jams a fully-loaded magazine into the mag well of her rifle and racks the action deftly.

AK-12: Time to show those Paradeus brats...

AK-12: What a true Tactical Doll is made of.
Part 15: The Prisoner's Dilemma II (tip)

15

【TIP】 You might find items near the interrogation room. When necessary, you can use them to deal with troublesome enemies.

Make sure you have an ample supply of items and use them wisely.
Part 16: The Prisoner's Dilemma III

16

Boom!

Ange's body is propelled forward by the powerful shockwave caused by the explosion.

RPK-16 pushes herself well beyond her normal physical parameters and dives over Ange to shield her from the blast.

After the failed assassination attempt, Paradeus has resorted to even more aggressive measures as they grow desperate.

RPK-16: I'm not built to be a shock trooper, for goodness' sake...

But the nightmare persists. The shockwave is followed by fire, rubble, and Paradeus coming in hot.

RPK-16 rips off her bipod and, using her machine gun as a makeshift assault rifle, she unleashes a barrage on the enemies coming from behind.

Without the time or space to get into proper shooting position, suppressive fire is all she can manage even as a Tactical Doll.

But her firepower alone can hardly hold off an entire squad.

RPK-16: Ange, wake up.

Ange: Uh... Ugh...

RPK-16: It's a shame, but it looks like I'm about to follow in dear 12's footsteps.

Ange: Don't...give me that.

Ange draws her pistol from the holster on her thigh and promptly fires several times behind her.

Unlike RPK-16, her shots are a lot more accurate, but her contribution in firepower is still hopelessly inadequate.

Clang!

A round lands on RPK-16's body, producing a sound that makes Ange's heart lurch.

RPK-16 has blocked a strafe of bullets fired at Ange with her own body.

RPK-16: Ange.

Ange: What?

RPK-16: It's been a pleasure to have met you.

Ange: ...Shut your face.

Ange: It's not time to read your epitaph yet.

As RPK-16's drum magazine runs dry, they lose the only way of fending off the Paradeus forces.

Ange pulls her trigger but it, too, clicks sharply and ejects no more cartridges.

Dammit... Almost there...!

Ange watches the slowly approaching white soldiers and reaches for her combat knife.

Boom!

Bang bang bang!

Another explosion erupts, followed by a shower of heavy gunfire.

A round hits the leading Paradeus soldier squarely in the forehead, toppling him instantly.

AN-94: Ange!

AK-15: Enemies targeted.

The two DEFY members let no bullet go to waste. The moment they join the fray, the tables have turned.

Ange: (Coughs)

AN-94: Ange!

Still holding up her rifle vigilantly, AN-94 makes her way quickly to Ange, who's slumped on the floor.

Meanwhile, RPK-16 has used the distraction created by her teammates' arrival to adjust her position and replace her expended magazine.

AN-94: Stasi reinforcements and the local police will be here soon.

RPK-16: Paradeus is retreating.

Ange: So should we. There's no point in pursuing them.

AK-15: Understood.

AK-15 slings her rifle onto her shoulder and carries Ange on her back.

Behind her, AN-94 and RPK-16 start laying down more suppressive fire.

AN-94: Where's 12?

Ange: ...

AN-94's anxious question is met with Ange's grim silence.

AN-94: ...

AN-94 bites her trembling lip and issues a signal with her free hand.

AN-94: Target secured! Retreat!

...

Boom!

Another deafening explosion comes from the upper floors until everything finally falls silent.

There is no more gunfire. Only the blazing flames crackle on.

AK-15, with Ange on her back, is the first to burst out of the sea of fire, followed closely by two other members of the pack.

J: Hey!

Standing outside the entrance is none other than J, who looks somber for once, and the Stasi agents who have been carried out from the fire with great difficulty. They have sustained heavy casualties.

J: What happened? Are you okay?

J rushes forward and helps AK-15 put Ange down, then he bellows at the people behind him.

J: Paramedics!

Ange: ...I'm fine.

Ange gasps for air. Her lungs are burning.

She can just make out the sirens of fire engines.

J: Who are you trying to kid? You look even more terrible than K after a mixer.

J: ...Where are the others?

AK-15: ...

AN-94: I'm sorry. We did our best.

AN-94: But we didn't see Mr. Light.

J: ...!

J: ...Come again? How could that brat possibly—

J: Hey, you've got to be kidding, right? How am I supposed to tell Shadow?!

This is the first time AN-94 has seen J so terrified.

Boom!

At that moment, another explosion erupts where the fire is blazing the most heavily in the apartment block.

Lying on the ground, Ange looks up at the night sky, which is lit up by the flames.

Ange: 12...

AN-94: Ange? Ange?

RPK-16: This doesn't bode well... 15, where's the first-aid kit?

AK-15: Right here.

...

...Here it goes again.

Fire, bullets...casualties.

Why has nothing changed at all?

Why is she just as helpless as she once was?

What kind of sick joke is this...?!

AN-94: Ange!

Ange: 94...

Ange: 12...12 stayed behind to cover our retreat.

Ange: So did Light...

AK-15: There are no bio signs in the building.

AK-15: I'm not detecting AK-12's signal either.

AN-94: Enough, 15!

Ange: ...

J: ...Comms are back.

RPK-16: Ange, you have an incoming call.

RPK-16: It's...the "Earl".

Griffin: You don't seem to be faring well, Angelia.

Ange: Your safe house is anything but safe.

Ange: Explain...yourself...you...son of a bitch...!

Griffin: You have no one but yourself to blame, Angelia.

Griffin: You were too rash.

Griffin: I told you to conduct an investigation, not engage them in open conflict.

Ange: Don't teach me how to do my job, bastard...who's just sitting on his ass.

Griffin: I am simply trying to set you back on track.

Griffin: ...As you can see, Paradeus is rearing its ugly head.

Griffin: This kind of attack is child's play for them.

Griffin: If their plan succeeds...

Griffin: The casualties will be tenfold... It will be on a completely different scale compared to Beslan.

Ange: Don't you...dare...bring up...Beslan!

Griffin: ...I wish you good luck.

Ange: You...mother...fucker.

AN-94: Ange! Ange!

Part 17: Flash (side)

    17chevron_right

...

Outside the apartment block.

The tardy fire brigade and police finally arrive. They seal off the building and start putting out the fire.

The Stasi has quietly slipped away from the scene and retreated into the shadows.

As actors in the previous act exits the stage, new ones enter.

Crowd Member A: Hey... Look! That woman!

Crowd Member B: Huh... Shadow? That's Shadowless!

Shadowless marches forcefully through the cordon, holding up her press card.

Shadowless: I am Shadowless from the DFF!

Shadowless: Who's in charge of the investigation here? I would like to cover this fire and report it on the news!

Beep.

Just then, her earpiece starts beeping.

Shadowless: Hello? Yes, speaking. Yeah, I'm already at the scene... Now? Everything is still in complete shambles.

Shadowless: I need backup. That's right, get me a cameraman.

Shadowless: 15 minutes? Are you kidding me?

Shadowless: Make it five!

She turns off her earpiece and looks towards the chaos.

Interviewing the firefighters is out of the question. The fire is still raging on; she can't get in their way right now.

The police? That's certainly an option...but the police hasn't been playing nice with her lately.

That leaves...

Shadowless: Hm?

Her acute sixth sense comes in useful once again at this crucial moment.

Shadowless: ...Jesus Christ.

She rushes towards one of the police officers in the middle of the crowd.

Shadowless: Kevin!

J: What are you doing here?!

J: No, how did you spot me?!

J, who is dressed in a police uniform, is dragged into an inconspicuous corner by Shadowless to talk out of the public eye.

Shadowless: Shut up! Now tell me, why are you here?!

Shadowless: What has the Stasi got to do with this?

J: Give me a break, Missy.

J: Do you want me to lose my job?

Shadowless: Please, I won't take up too much of your time!

Shadowless grabs J by his collar and turns off her pen recorder.

With the situation being so chaotic out there, hardly anyone would pay attention to the two people locked in a confrontation in this quiet corner.

Shadowless: I don't want to make things difficult for you... Just tell me—is Light okay?

Shadowless: He didn't come home last night. I could tell something's off about him.

J: ...

J opens his mouth but doesn't know what to say.

Shadowless: ...We had a fight.

J: Uh... Are you blaming that on me?

Shadowless stomps on J's foot viciously.

Shadowless: It was the same old argument...but I thought long and hard about it this time.

Shadowless: I want you to pass a message to him.

J: Can you not drag me into your sibling squabbles...

J's face contorts with pain, for which he is secretly grateful.

Thanks to this, he won't have to worry about how to keep a straight face. Shadow's intuition is incredibly keen. She'll notice immediately if he slips up.

...What is he supposed to say to her?

Shadowless: Shut it! Stop interrupting me!

Shadowless: It's your fault that he joined the Stasi to begin with!

Shadowless peers around carefully.

Shadowless: ...I've thought a lot on what he said, and perhaps he's right.

Shadowless: I understand and respect his decision... We're family.

Shadowless: I will always support him.

J: ...

Shadowless: That's it.

She lets go of J, then her gaze shifts away in feigned nonchalance as she fidgets with her hair.

J can't tell if she's making sure they aren't overheard or trying to cover up her sheepishness.

J: ...I'll let him know.

Shadowless: Thanks... Come and have dinner at our place one of these days.

Shadowless: It's been a while.

Satisfied with J's promise, Shadowless smiles and nods apologetically before darting out from the corner.

True to her words, she has not taken up much of J's time.

J: Light...you little punk...

He watches as Shadowless throws herself back into her work as she starts interviewing eyewitnesses of the fire. He looks up at the apartment block, where the fire is now under control.

...He must get inside.

J: Excuse me! Make way!

J: Police!

Displaying his forged police ID, J makes his way through the crowd.

Temporary command post, Berlin.

ST AR-15 brings a chair for the Commander to sit by the window. The afternoon sunlight streams in, warming the Commander's back.

ST AR-15: Commander, I believe we should wake up this damn Nyto and start interrogating her.

ST AR-15: Mr. Griffin already mentioned that she looks exactly like the mole planted next to Ange. For all we know, you might end up falling victim to her this time...

Commander: I know, but she is in no physical or mental shape for that right now. Waking her up by force will not help us in our questioning either.

RO635: Don't be hasty, 15.

RO635: We've already verified that Machlian has very low combat capability—SOP-II alone can handle her, let alone when we have so many Dolls protecting the Commander.

ST AR-15: But—

Commander: I'll ask Ange about Morridow at our meeting.

Commander: Go get ready. We're moving out in 15 minutes.

M4 SOPMOD II: Eh? Weren't you supposed to meet at 3?

Commander: It's basic etiquette to show up early for a meeting with a lady.

RO635: Commander, there's an incoming transmission.

Commander: Is it Ange?

UMP45: Hi, Commander. It's been a while.

UMP45: I hope I didn't interrupt your refined appreciation of sleeping beauties.

Commander: ...

Before the Commander even replies, RO has already closed the curtains without them needing to say a word.

UMP45: Oh my, looks like I've just scored some intel which I can use to soak some money out of you.

UMP45: I wonder, how much would you pay to seal my lips, Commander?

Commander: ...Cut the crap. What are you guys doing here?

UMP45: We're here because Miss Helian most generously paid our urgent booking fees in order to help the poor, isolated Commander, of course.

UMP9: But it looks like the Commander is living the good life right now!

Commander: ...Helian did?

UMP45: Oh yes, Miss Helian paid the entire sum in advance. ♪

Commander: ...

UMP9: Right, 45, didn't Miss Kalina ask us to pass a message on to the Commander?

Commander: Kalina? You've spoken to Kalina?

Commander: How is she now? Has her condition improved? Has she been discharged yet?

UMP45: She's alright. At least, she sounded quite energetic when she passed on her message to you.

Commander: What did she want to tell me?

UMP45: 9, you do it.

UMP9: Kay~ Ahem.

416: Wait a minute, I can't find my earplugs...

UMP9: So, Miss Kalina's message is as follows...

UMP9: COMMANDER!

UMP9: YOU GREAT BIG DUMMY!!!

UMP9: I WAS IN HOSPITAL FOR SO LONG!!!

UMP9: BUT YOU DIDN'T COME TO VISIT EVEN ONCE!!!

UMP9: WHEN I GET OUT OF HOSPITAL I'M GOING TO SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY!!!

UMP45: And that was it.

416: Scheißdreck, do they have a place that recalibrates auditory modules in Berlin?

Gr G11: (Groans) What happened?

Commander: ...

Commander: Alright, I understand.

UMP45: Well, since the fee's been credited into our account, that means our contract is in effect.

UMP45: Commander, contact us on this frequency if you need help with anything.

UMP45: We'll be standing by during your time in Berlin.

Commander: How many credits did Helian pay you, anyway...

UMP45: Trade secret. ♪

Commander: ...

Commander: We'll be meeting Ange in 15 minutes at the Athena's Owl.

Commander: Could you scout our route and make sure there are no Paradeus ambushers hiding along the way?

UMP45: Sure. We'll be there right away.

The transmission ends.

RO635: Commander, this mission ought to be much easier with 404's help.

M4 SOPMOD II: And it sounds like Miss Kalina's getting better!

Commander: Yeah, it's a good start to things.

The AR Team prepares to leave with the Commander. Perosa is waiting at the door.

Perosa: Do you need us for anything, Commander?

Commander: I'll be leaving Machlian in your care.

Commander: Dandelion will be staying behind too. Go get her if Machlian starts acting up.

Perosa: Understood.

After sorting out Machlian, the Commander changes into plain clothes before leading the AR Team out of the temporary command post.

...In Berlin's Old Town.

On the way to the designated bar.

M4 SOPMOD II: Looks like we'll have to walk through all of Old Town before we can get to this Athena's Owl place...

ST AR-15: That's definitely a place Ange would choose.

RO635: Commander...

Commander: Hm?

RO, who has been observing her surroundings all this time, walks up to the Commander while trying to keep her face neutral.

Commander: What is it?

RO635: ...It's nothing urgent, but I was thinking... Don't we stand out a little too much?

Commander: ...

The Commander is leading three Tactical Dolls who have put their weapons away on a crowded street in the Old Town district. No matter how you look at it, this grouping...

Commander: Relax. The Earl has arranged legal identities for us, and we're in the city, so even Paradeus can't move rashly here.

UMP45: It's true that there are no Paradeus forces lying in ambush, but there are a lot of people out there who are even sketchier than Paradeus, and they have their eyes on you.

UMP45: ...You've practically handed the Berlin Old Town Doll black market a feast on legs.

SOP-II's keen ears quickly sift out the important information from the clamor of the crowd.

???: Do you see that? They're all high-end Tactical Dolls, and they're also loaded with advanced equipment...

???: Just selling that gear would feed us till the end of the year!

???: If we can grab those Dolls, doesn't matter if we strip their parts for sale or just format them and sell off their bodies...

???: We'll be sitting pretty for the next few years, hehehe!

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, they're black market Doll traffickers!

RO635: There aren't a lot of them, but we can't make too much of a scene right now.

Commander: 45, help us think of a way to shake off these people.

UMP45: I've already plotted a route. Sending it over now.

Commander: Right. RO, follow the route at top speed.

The Commander and company proceed as guided by Squad 404.

After following the route they've been given, the party temporarily shakes off the thugs following them and blends into the hustle and bustle of the Old Town district.

M4 SOPMOD II: Man, it's so busy here. Looks like they're holding a festival or something.

M4 SOPMOD II: And how come they're selling anti-ELID stuff everywhere? Does it really work?

ST AR-15: All things aside, one look at the price and you can tell they can't possibly be of use.

RO635: It's just a bunch of profit-driven merchants exploiting the people's despair by slapping "anti-ELID" on the items they sell.

M4 SOPMOD II: But won't those merchants get beaten up if people find out?

RO635: ...Survivor bias is a thing.

RO635: After all, the only way to tell if these anti-ELID goods work is if you go into a contaminated zone yourself.

RO635: And only those who come back alive will have the chance to give feedback on them.

Commander: Have we lost them, 45?

UMP45: Com... behind...

RO635: 45? Do you copy?

UMP45: R... cut off....

The transmission to 404 suddenly cuts off.

ST AR-15: Why do they keep cocking up when it matters?

Commander: Stay alert and continue towards the bar.

I don't know what's the special occasion, but the crowded streets are filled with salespeople peddling anti-ELID wares.

Girl's Voice: Galatea employees all use this super-effective anti-ELID medicine! We also have blessed anti-ELID talismans!

Girl's Voice: Big bargains! Discounts if you buy in bulk!

Male Voice: Do have a look, ladies! These are the latest anti-ELID basketball shoes!

Male Voice: Not only are they radiation-proof, they have collectors' value too!

RO looks back and spots the thugs from earlier still following them.

RO635: Commander, they've caught up to us.

Commander: We'll blend into the crowd and speed up. We need to think of a way to ditch them.

RO635: Roger.

The Commander and company begin jogging through the crowd.

This inadvertently causes the crowd behind them to speed up as well.

Crowd: Is the festival about to start?

Crowd: Why are those people in such a hurry?

Crowd: If we don't catch up, we'll miss out on the free gifts!

Crowd: We should get moving too!

The crowd, along with their unwanted pursuers, stampedes toward the Commander's party.

???: There! They're over there!

???: We can't make our move now. There's too many people around. Let's get close to them first.

???: Get them, bros! Those are high-end Dolls we're talking about! Just one of them could feed us for three years!

???: Gogogogogo!

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander! They're speeding up too!

ST AR-15: Should we make our move?

Commander: There are too many people here. Civilians could easily get injured.

The communicator suddenly rings.

UMP9: Raise it higher, 416!

416: Is this even working, 45? Can you contact the Commander?!

416: If not, we'll just fight our way out!

RO635: Commander, it's 404!

UMP45: Huh, we got through at last.

Commander: What happened to you just now?

UMP45: Our comms got jammed. We had to relocate several times before we could contact you.

RO635: You were jammed?

UMP45: The jamming method was pretty special too—reminded me of Tallinn.

UMP45: I'll go into more detail later. You see that alley ten meters ahead? Get in there and go all the way to the end.

Commander: Got it!

ST AR-15: Commander, it's a dead end!

UMP45: If you keep the fight in there, the people outside won't notice.

UMP45: Now the AR Team can really let loose. ♪

M4 SOPMOD II: Awesome!

Commander: ...

Commander: Load rubber bullets and avoid their vitals. Prepare for combat.
Part 2: SoT II - Mid-stage Dialogue

...

The Commander and company tear through the streets in a frenzy, desperately searching for the bar named "Athena's Owl".

Commander: We're screwed! Only 5 minutes left!

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, is this the bar?!

ST AR-15: RO, is it this one?

RO635: Hang on...

Commander: I'm going in to ask them directly!

The Commander rushes in.

RO frantically hits her translator, which is taking its own sweet time to warm up.

RO635: Hurry up, what's this bar called?

ST AR-15: Relax, we still have time.

Before the translator can complete the translation, the Commander has already rushed back out.

Commander: Dammit! Not this one!

M4 SOPMOD II: ...Why is the Commander in such a panic?

ST AR-15: Don't ask, just follow.

RO635: Ah, it's done.

RO635: Wait a minute, this bar is a hangout for the "Basement Crow" mob...

As vicious cursing erupts behind them, the Commander and the others redouble their efforts to flee the scene.
Part 3: SoT II - Mid-stage Dialogue

...

The Commander and company tear through the streets in a frenzy, desperately searching for their destination⁠—a bar named "Athena's Owl".

Commander: I'm late I'm late I'm late!

ST AR-15: Commander! Don't panic! Look where you're going!

A man suddenly steps into the Commander's path.

Commander: Ah!

Passer-By: Ow!

The Commander crashes into the man.

RO635: Commander! Are you alright?

Commander: I'm fine.

Commander: Sorry about that...

Passer-By: I feel so dizzy. Put me in a chair, please?

M4 SOPMOD II: Wow, he's bleeding from the head!

RO635: Commander, what should we do?

Passer-By: I work in this bar. Could you help me inside?

Then the Commander feels a caress that may or may not be intentional on their hand.

Passer-By: Or maybe I could buy you a drink?

The Commander looks up at the bar's signboard, which reads, "Pink Flavor". They look back down at the flirty passer-by.

Commander: ...

Commander: Sorry, I'm busy.

The Commander flees at the speed of light.
Part 4: SoT II - Mid-stage Dialogue

...

The Commander and company tear through the streets in a frenzy, desperately searching for their destination⁠—a bar named "Athena's Owl".

Commander: I'm doomed I'm doomed I'm doomed I'm doomed!

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, Commander, Commander! Over here, over here! Over hereeee!

RO635: Commander! This is the place!

ST AR-15: What kind of crappy bar is this?! Why is it so damn hard to find?! My pillow would be better at running a business than the boss of this place!

"Athena's Owl" suddenly looms into view in front of everyone.

Commander: I finally...

Commander: Made it...!

The Commander charges inside without a second thought.
Part 5: Ship of Theseus III

...At the entrance of Athena's Owl.

Commander: One minute left!

RO635: Commander, we'll be standing by outside, if there's anything—

Commander: 30 SECONDS!!!

The Commander rushes into the bar.

RO635: Whew... Made it in the nick of time, at least.

RO635: 45, what was with that signal interference?

UMP45: We still haven't identified the precise cause, but it was definitely very fishy.

ST AR-15: Who would have thought that UMP45, the EW expert, would end up being jammed? And she took so long to resolve the issue too.

UMP45: Actually, we didn't.

UMP45: We couldn't find any sign of a jammer, so we had to keep changing positions to gauge the jammer's effective range.

RO635: How could you not find it?

RO635: In theory, jammers work by sending signals to generate interference that breaks our connections.

UMP45: Yes, which is why I said it was fishy.

UMP45: With normal jammers, we'd be able to at least sense their presence even if we couldn't disable them.

UMP45: But this particular jammer felt like it directly cut off our connections. I couldn't feel anything.

RO635: ...

RO635: That IS very dangerous.

UMP45: Yeah, we'll discuss this further once the Commander is done in there.

UMP45: Right now, we need to rest.

RO635: Copy that.

After ending the transmission, RO continues to puzzle over the jamming issue.

SOP-II shakes her by the shoulder and points to the huge display board opposite the bar.

The supermarket across the street turns its exterior display on at 3pm sharp.

The display written in a fancy font reads, "Congratulations on Galatea Corporation's 100th Anniversary".

M4 SOPMOD II: RO, look!

M4 SOPMOD II: So that's why the crowd was going crazy earlier! It was all because of this!

M4 SOPMOD II: This Galatea Corporation sure is swanky! Maybe when we get our own 100th anniversary, we can ask the Commander to buy an ad signboard just like this!

ST AR-15: By then the Commander will be an old—

RO635: Ahem, let's leave it till then.

M4 SOPMOD II: Kay...

RO gazes at the monitor that is currently playing Galatea Corporation publicity videos. A good-looking refugee representative is currently making a speech to convey her gratitude.

Refugee Representative: ...Galatea Corporation has done a lot for us, not only in terms of material support, but also in spiritual comfort.

Refugee Representative: Many people think that they are already bestowing a most gracious gift by giving us refuge, even though they've done little to improve our terrible living condition.

Refugee Representative: Only Galatea sees our pain of losing our homes to radiation contamination and offers a helping hand...

ST AR-15: What's on your mind, RO?

RO635: The name of this corporation also came up in Bohnsdorf.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: Both the timing and location where it showed up were surprising coincidental.

Ting-a-ling...

The bell behind the door tinkles softly.

A white-haired girl steps out, carrying a bag of cat food in her arms.

AN-94: ...

ST AR-15: 94?

AN-94: 15...

AN-94: Hello, members of the AR Team.

ST AR-15: Hi. Are Ange and the Commander having a good chat?

AN-94: ...It's pretty good.

AN-94 quietly walks to the side of the road and crouches down. The cat that was sunning itself on the eaves lazily jumps down and rubs up against AN-94's hand.

ST AR-15: Since you're here, that means...

Ting-a-ling... The doorbell tinkles again.

AK-12: If it isn't the AR Team! It's been a while.

RO635: Yes, it really has.

AK-12: You should go in and get a drink. The bartender here is pretty good.

AK-12: Of all the bars Ange and I have visited, his mixing skills rank among the top three.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wow...

M4 SOPMOD II: Then why did you come out?

AK-12: It's obviously because there's someone annoying in there.

ST AR-15: You guys came to Berlin first. How is it?

AK-12: Not too good. Recently, Ange's been... Well, I guess you can tell.

ST AR-15: Is it because of that "Morridow" woman?

AK-12: Of course... She's the cause of all this. If it weren't for her, we wouldn't even be here.

RO635: What is she like?

AK-12: She's a devious high-spec Nyto who is an expert in pretense. She can change personalities the way people change clothes.

ST AR-15: ...

RO635: Is she good at disguising herself?

AK-12: Without question. Morridow is a talented con artist. Ange's as sharp as a knife and even she was deceived.

ST AR-15: ...We might have captured Morridow.

RO635: 15, we can't be sure of that yet. The Commander's still looking into it.

AK-12: Oh? Then you'd better be careful. All the grief we've gone through recently is thanks to her.

ST AR-15: No wonder she could draw out that many Paradeus troops.

AK-12: She's also very good at changing her image to take advantage of her victim's weaknesses.

AK-12: I'm a bit concerned—someone like the Commander could certainly resist interrogation, but perhaps not a request for help coming from a weak and vulnerable person.

ST AR-15: ...

RO635: While the Commander is both righteous and kind, I don't think they'd be easily deceived.

AK-12: Don't worry, Ange's definitely going to give the Commander lots of useful suggestions.

Ting-a-ling...

RPK-16: Oh my, so many familiar faces.

AK-15: ...

RO635: Are you RPK-16 and AK-15 of Task Force DEFY?

RPK-16: Yes, we are. And you must be RO635, the current leader of the AR Team, right?

RO635: Hello, nice to meet you.

RPK-16: Nice to meet you.

RPK-16: Oh, don't mind me. Please carry on with your conversation.

RO635: ...

The moment RPK-16 shows up, AK-12 leans against the wall and closes her eyes to rest.

Silence hangs in the air.

In the distance, the Galatea Corporation publicity videos are still chattering on.

Mrs. Gray: ...All this time, Galatea Corporation has focused its efforts on researching anti-ELID medications, and I believe everyone will be happy with the results we have achieved.

Mrs. Gray: You may have heard of the new type of anti-ELID medication called "Idunn".

Mrs. Gray: Our aspirations for this formulation are to make it safer, more effective, cheaper and more widely available.

Mrs. Gray: Idunn has shown promising results in clinical trials so far, and it is currently under review by the government.

Mrs. Gray: We believe that it can be launched in the not-too-distant future, and when that happens we cordially invite everyone to judge the effectiveness of Idunn for themselves.

Mrs. Gray: It is always darkest before dawn, so please do not give up hope. We will surely see the first rays when the sun comes up!

The crowds surrounding the monitor cheer wildly.

Even from quite a distance away, the Dolls gathered at the bar's rear entrance can feel the genuine outpour of joy and hope from the people.

The Dolls watch the jubilant crowd with curiosity.

RPK-16: Humans are such fragile yet resilient creatures.

RPK-16: They are easily crushed by absolute might, but if you give them a little bit of hope...

RPK-16: Even if it's just a little, it can reignite their thirst for life.

At some point, RPK-16 has walked up next to RO635.

RO635: ...You're right.

M4 SOPMOD II: It's better to be a Doll though! If our bodies break, we can simply get a new one!

RPK-16: I disagree.

RPK-16: Have you heard of the Ship of Theseus?

M4 SOPMOD II: What's that?

RPK-16: A long time ago, a human posed a question.

RPK-16: If the planks of the ship of Theseus were constantly being changed out, until none of the planks were the original ones, then would it still be the original ship?

RPK-16: Now apply the same question to Dolls. If our parts are constantly replaced, or if we get a new body entirely, then are we still the same Dolls that we originally were?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hm...

RO635: This story...

RPK-16: We need to keep replacing our parts to keep functioning.

RPK-16: But human bodies don't work that way.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hmmm...

RPK-16: Discounting things like accidents, humans can live a long time in their own bodies of flesh.

RPK-16: Their bodies may be fragile, but they are heartbreakingly pure and unadulterated.

RO635: Your thoughts are very profound, Miss RPK-16...

SOP-II has already dozed off while leaning on RO's shoulder.

Out of politeness, RO is compelled to stay where she is.

RPK-16: Miss RO, do you find my musings dry and boring?

RO635: Not at all...

M4 SOPMOD II: Zzzzz...

RO635: You're drooling again, SOP-II...

RPK-16: That's wonderful. There are many things I'd like to ask you, Miss RO.

RPK-16 turns toward RO and peers at her with fascination.

RPK-16: I hear that you're the prototype for the third generation of Dolls.

RPK-16: Miss Persica didn't place any restrictions on your base layer.

RO635: Um...

RO635: That's true, but practically speaking there's no real difference.

RPK-16: A base layer like a blank sheet of paper...

RPK-16: It's as close to a human soul as you can get.

RO635: ...

RPK-16: I suppose you could say that in a certain sense, you have a human heart, Miss RO.

RO635: Well, I wouldn't go that far. At the end of the day, I'm—

RPK-16: Then have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be a human?

RPK-16: After all, the only thing that keeps you from being completely human is not having a body made of flesh, right?

RPK-16: If a Doll had a soul as pure as a human's and a body as pure as a human's, then she would practically be no different than her creator...

RO635: What?

The unexpected question is so unnerving that RO takes a step back.

ST AR-15's eyes snap open from her feigned sleep. AK-15 and AK-12 also eye their teammate incredulously.

RPK-16: Aw, don't be so tense, I was just thinking out loud.

RO635: Er... Sorry... I've never thought about this question before, so I don't know how to answer it.

Ting-a-ling...

The Commander steps out of the back door.

Commander: RO, let's—

Commander: Oh hey, it's Task Force DEFY. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

RPK-16: Hello, Commander.

Commander: Hello. Ange's waiting for you in there.

Commander: RO, we should head back.

RO635: OK. 15, SOP-II, let's go.

M4 SOPMOD II: zzzzZZZZZ...

ST AR-15: SOP-II, wake up! Time to go!

...On a rooftop occupied by Squad 404 in the Old Town district.

416: What the hell were they droning on about? It almost put me to sleep.

UMP9: 45, what's on your mind?

UMP45: ...

UMP45's gaze once again falls on RPK-16, who is currently smiling and talking to Ange.

UMP45: I have a feeling something's about to happen.
Part 6: Ariadne's Clew I

6

...Temporary command post, Berlin.

Utterly exhausted, the Commander flops down on the sofa right after entering the room.

UMP45: Since you've safely returned to the command post, we'll go get some rest ourselves.

Commander: Sure, your work for the day is over too.

UMP9: Hurry, 45! If we don't leave soon, the queues are going to be super long!

UMP45: Coming. See you tomorrow, Commander.

The transmission ends, and the Commander lifts a hand up to their forehead.

RO635: How was Miss Ange?

Commander: Well enough. At the very least, she looked like she could still easily snap my neck.

ST AR-15: Speaking of which, about Machlian—

Perosa stands in the doorway with a cup of strong tea in hand.

Commander: What happened?

Perosa: She's awake, Commander.

Perosa: Also, I think you'll need this.

The Commander accepts the tea, which is at just the right temperature. Its thick aroma fills the nose and lifts the spirits.

Commander: Get Dandelion. We'll begin the interrogation.

Perosa: She's compiling our information on Bohnsdorf.

Commander: Then we'll start without her.

Inside the room, Machlian has already woken up and is sitting on a chair while glaring coldly at the Commander.

The Commander drags a chair over and sits opposite her.

Machlian: ...

Commander: Your name is Machlian, is that correct?

Machlian: Yes.

Machlian: What about you? Are you really called Robin?

Commander: No comment, but you can keep calling me Robin if you like.

Machlian: ...I knew it.

Machlian: Still, you did save me.

The Commander looks up from the information on the tablet and carefully studies Machlian's appearance.

She's still a little groggy and confused, having just woken up from being knocked out.

She looks practically identical to the picture of Morridow, but her temperament couldn't be any more different.

Is Morridow just that good at disguising herself, or is she really somebody else?

Commander: When did you first join Paradeus?

Machlian: I was never part of Paradeus. I'm just an ordinary person.

Commander: ...

Commander: From what I know, there is a girl from Paradeus who looks just like you.

Commander: You might have heard her name before—Morridow.

Commander: What is your relationship with her?

Machlian: ...

Commander: Or are you her, perhaps?

Machlian: I have only one name—Machlian. That's the only thing people call me.

Commander: So you refuse to disclose the nature of your relationship with her?

Machlian: I don't care about her affairs and I don't want to hear about her. I want nothing to do with her for the rest of my life.

Machlian's eyes fill with fear and pain at the mention of Morridow's name.

Commander: Then let's talk about you. When we found you, you were in Bohnsdorf.

Commander: Bohnsdorf was a refugee shelter that was built a few years ago. What were you doing there?

Machlian: ...Treating ELID patients.

Commander: Why?

Machlian: There's no why to it. Since I have the ability to do so, I ought to use it to treat refugees in need.

Commander: To my knowledge, there is no existing medical cure for ELID.

Commander: The most common therapy nowadays involves strengthening the patient's antibodies to gradually defeat the illness.

Commander: But I saw you pray over a refugee and perform a certain ritual, and then the refugee got better, just like that.

Commander: What did you do? Was it some kind of medicine?

Machlian: Yes...

Commander: Where did your medicine come from?

Machlian: ...

Commander: Who supplied you with the medicine?

Machlian: ...

Machlian looks like she wants to say something, but her lips quiver for a long time without uttering a word.

Commander: Are you afraid of something?

Machlian: ...

Machlian: I...

Machlian goes quiet, avoiding the question.

Machlian: If all you want from me is treatment...

Machlian: Then you can just bring the patients to me, and I will save them.

Machlian: But if you kidnapped me because you're after the exact treatment method, then you have wasted your time.

Machlian: Because I'm the only one who can administer it.

Commander: ...

Machlian: We haven't known each other for a long time, but I can sense that you're different from those who profit off anti-ELID products. Profit is not your goal.

Machlian: I am not saying this to trick you or win your trust. I simply wish for us to meet each other halfway.

Machlian: If you release me, I am willing to help you.

There is a creak as Dandelion pushes the door open.

Dandelion: Commander, I've finished compiling the information on Bohnsdorf.

Machlian: ...

The moment she sees Dandelion, Machlian's calm features begin to distort...

Machlian: Paradeus... You...

Machlian: You're from Paradeus...

Commander: What?

Machlian's eyes fill with tears as she glares at the Commander with a look of anger and despair. Disbelief and betrayal are written all over her face.

Machlian: Here you are again!

Machlian: What are you going to do to me this time?!

Machlian: You're going to strap me onto a slab and torture me forever, aren't you?!

Commander: We aren't going to do that! Machlian, please, calm down...

Machlian laughs derisively as she stares blankly.

Machlian: I won't let you have your way.

Machlian: Neither him, nor YOU.

Commander: ...

Machlian: Nobody will—

Dandelion: Commander, her virtual cognition image is disintegrating!

Machlian: She's coming! She's coming!

Machlian: I can hear her footsteps!

Commander: Dandelion, subdue her!

Dandelion: On it.

A second later, Machlian knocks over the table as she slumps limply to the ground.

M4 SOPMOD II: What does it mean when a virtual cognition image disintegrates?

Dandelion: Simply put, it's like a Doll's neural cloud meltdown.

RO635: A virtual cognition image? Is that the Paradeus' equivalent of a neural cloud? Why have I never heard that term before?

Dandelion: Because I just made it up on the spot.

Dandelion: I have already verified the presence of a virtual cognition image in Machlian, which is to say she is 100% a Nyto.

Dandelion: I should also point out that now is when her defenses are the most lax, so I recommend hacking her directly.

RO635: ...

Commander: Why didn't you tell me earlier? Will it cause her harm?

Dandelion: You never asked.

Dandelion: And her current lack of resistance will actually minimize the damage we inflict.

Commander: Then get started right away. I want answers!

Dandelion: Understood.
Part 7: One-Sided Recollection

7

【WARNING】 This is a 【Combat Tutorial】, do not skip!

Dandelion's Voice: Commander, we have entered Machlian's virtual cognitive image.

Dandelion's Voice: Our actions here may alter the environment in unpredictable ways.

Dandelion's Voice: I will release the neural data of certain Griffin T-Dolls stored within me. Their experience in battle will be of great assistance to us.

Dandelion's Voice: I can strengthen our forces by harnessing the Dolls' experience. Of course, it is your choice whose data to use, but we will face more powerful enemies with each enhancement.

Dandelion's Voice: The two skills in the bottom right corner are 【Enhance】 and 【Throw】.

Dandelion's Voice: 【Enhance】 gives you a 10-point shield for 3 seconds.

Dandelion's Voice: 【Throw】 deals 1.5x AoE damage to the farthest enemy.

Dandelion's Voice: Use them well to defeat the enemy and we can delve deeper into the virtual consciousness.

Dandelion's Voice: Pause mid-battle to view your selected Doll experience. You may also tap "Battle Settlement" to exit the current battle.

Dandelion's Voice: Our exploration will still count as a success even if you exit this way.

Dandelion's Voice: Also, you won't be able to select new battle experience after 8 battles, but there is no end to the danger in this virtual cognitive image.

Dandelion's Voice: You might enjoy testing the limit of the virtual consciousness?

Dandelion's Voice: If you're up for the challenge, have a go at it in Endless Mode.

Dandelion's Voice: Don't give up and try to push us as far as we can go.
Part 8: Ariadne's Clew III

8

Through Dandelion, the Commander finds an extraordinary amount of memory fragments in Machlian's virtual cognition image...

Dandelion: How interesting...

ST AR-15: You've been muttering to yourself for a while now. What have you found?

Dandelion: Machlian is truly a collection of contradictions. The structure of her virtual cognition image looks like very early Paradeus technology, but her memory fragments are presented in a way that is nothing like I've ever seen in a Nyto before.

RO635: So she's both new and old...?

Dandelion: The memory fragments from the abandoned Isomers in Tallinn were just a collection of low-res visual clips, but Machlian's memories look like they've been digitized.

Commander: Is it hard to process her virtual consciousness?

Dandelion: Hacking her virtual consciousness isn't difficult in itself, but I don't know where to start when it comes to a collection of memory fragments of this size.

ST AR-15: Well, whatever its structure, you can always sort them by chronological order, right?

Dandelion: If it were that simple, I would have done it already, but that's impossible here.

Dandelion: Machlian's memory fragments lack timestamps, so I can't put them in chronological order.

RO635: How could that be?!

Dandelion: That's how it is.

M4 SOPMOD II: What's that supposed to mean?

RO635: Memory fragments are all timestamped from creation and they are typically never removed.

RO635: Unless...

Dandelion: Unless someone really had all the free time to go frame by frame and trim off the timestamps for every single one.

ST AR-15: Deleting the timestamps for this amount of memory fragments on a frame-by-frame basis seems almost impossible.

RO635: Then that leaves only one possibility—her memories were destructively wiped, which led to the loss of their timestamps and her memories being thrown into disarray.

M4 SOPMOD II: So even she doesn't know what really happened in the past?

Commander: ...

Commander: Is it possible that somebody could have embedded these memory fragments into her?

Dandelion: No.

Dandelion: Machlian's virtual cognition image is extremely fragile and forcibly implanting memories could have led to a complete breakdown.

Dandelion: Also, I collected some readable data, but since they're out of order, reorganizing them might lead to many different conclusions once they're read.

Commander: Please go over the fragments which can be read.

Dandelion: Alright, I'll start from the most recent one...

...In Bohnsdorf.

Elsa: ...My Lady, do you have any brothers or sisters?

Machlian: Hm, I suppose you could say I have a little sister.

Elsa: Wow, your little sister must love you since you're so nice, My Lady!

Machlian: ...That doesn't seem to be the case, though.

Elsa: Hm? Do you not get along with your sister?

Machlian: Two insects fall into a small hole. They can hold each other to keep warm and find a way to survive together, or they can trample each other underfoot to see who comes out on top.

Machlian: Right now, neither of the insects is moving, because the storm has yet to come.

Machlian: Once it arrives, there is no telling what will happen.

Machlian: I guess that largely sums up our relationship.

Elsa: I don't quite get it...

Elsa: But that's okay! You're my favorite person in the world, My Lady!

Machlian: Haha, you're my favorite person too, Elsa...

Commander: Another memory of Bohnsdorf... We've seen those several times already.

RO635: It's smooth and clear, but doesn't tell us anything of value.

Dandelion: It can't be helped. It seems only the memories from this period are clear.

Commander: Let's look through the muddled memory fragments.

...In a lab.

She is shackled to some kind of experimental device.

A man whose face is distorted and blurred sits opposite her.

□□: How do you feel now?

Machlian: Not very good...

□□: Do you still remember who you are?

Machlian: ...Machlian.

□□: Do you still remember who I am?

Machlian: You... You're...

A stretch of painful and garbled memories flood into her mind, but Machlian does not say anything.

□□: Hmm, are you experiencing memory impediment?

□□: Very good, it seems the memory scrubbing is showing more progress from yesterday.

□□: Let's wipe her again. Perhaps I'll make a breakthrough with my experiment today.

Assistant: Understood...

The man's assistant walks over and does something to the device.

Machlian: What are you going to do to me...?

□□: Before we begin the scrub, I'll show you something nice.

The man holds a picture up to Machlian's eyes.

It is a warm and loving family picture. A perfectly ordinary husband and wife lean affectionately against each other, and the girl in the middle smiles. Even the gap where her missing front tooth should be seems to be smiling too.

Machlian: Papa... Mama...

□□: And I'll tell you another little secret.

□□: Your beloved father and mother...are dead.

□□: Well, calling them dead isn't quite right. They're still wandering around in the village, attacking every living creature that passes by.

Machlian: ...

Machlian: No... No... I don't believe it!

Machlian: Let me go! I want to find Papa and Mama!

She struggles vigorously, but the device that keeps her shackled does not yield.

□□: Oh yes, struggle, struggle with all your might!

□□: Not like you will remember our conversation once you wake up.

□□: Begin the scrub.

Assistant: Got it.

Her mind instantly goes blank. The world spins end over end and all kinds of images dance before her eyes.

After an indeterminate amount of time, the world finally quiets down again.

□□: How do you feel now?

Machlian: Not very good...

The man with the distorted face laughs menacingly, and Machlian's vision begins to blur...

Commander: ...

Commander: Are there any fragments where his face is visible?

Dandelion: I do not recommend doing that at the moment. Machlian's virtual consciousness is weak to begin with; forcibly restoring specially processed image data could easily lead to a breakdown.

M4 SOPMOD II: That guy's face is such a scary mess...

RO635: I don't know if that's the result of Machlian's fear for him or the alterations Paradeus has made to her memories.

RO635: If it's the latter, it would mean Paradeus has a terrifying degree of control over virtual cognition.

Commander: ...Keep searching.

Dandelion puts Machlian's mind on display. Fragments of all colors, sizes and shapes are scattered everywhere. Some of them seem out of place, while others even look damaged.

Commander: Start with these fragments and look for the ones with similar colors. Doesn't matter if they're blurred.

Dandelion: Alright.

...Inside a certain underground base.

An electronic monitor clearly displays a map of Berlin, covered in densely-packed location markers.

A girl with a blurred face is giving out assignments.

???: Do you remember your assigned locations?

White Nyto: We have memorized them.

Black Nyto: We will proceed to our assigned positions and carry out our tasks.

???: Very good, very good.

The girl with the blurred face hands out control devices to the Nytos.

The Nytos respectfully hold out both hands to receive them.

???: Do you know what these are? Dare you reach out to take them?

Black Nyto: ...What are these?

???: What?!

The girl suddenly flies into a rage. She picks up the black Nyto by the collar and throws her toward a nearby wall.

A splatter of blood instantly covers the wall.

???: This concerns Father's Operation Cocoon, a plan of utmost importance! How dare you not pay attention?!

???: You there, tell me, what is this?!

White Nyto: It is the control device for an Iaso's Box.

???: Correct! It is a weapon that will make the world a better place!

???: With just a push of this little button, wonderful hope will fly out of the box.

???: When everyone pushes this button, all of Berlin will be filled with glorious hope!

The Nytos fall to their knees one after the other and hold their arms out to the girl...

The white Nyto's finger lightly taps the button for the control device.

White Nyto: Is the mission complete?

Black Nyto: Everything is ready.

White Nyto: Very good. All is for Father's glory.

Black Nyto: For Father's glory.

The Nytos begin praying devoutly...

Countless white Nytos press the buttons on the control devices they are holding...

Boom—

A series of explosions fill the air, and pale yellow pollen works its way into every corner of the city.

The contamination index in the city spikes to Red Zone levels. People flood the streets, desperately trying to get out of the pollen's range.

But in the end, they all collapse on the street one after the other.

Some of them don't get up again, but others come back to life in another way.

ELID Infected: Aaarghhhhh...

White Nyto: Remember Father's orders. Search for all the semi- and pan-immunosomes and bring them back to the base alive.

Black Nyto: Yes.

A legion of Nytos walk into the pale yellow pollen. Bestial howls blend with desperate human wails...

An inferno has manifested on earth.

Perosa: ...Is this Berlin?

RO635: I saw the quarantine wall...

Commander: ...

Commander: Record this entire stretch, we need to be sure about this.

My hand trembles slightly as it holds my teacup. I can't get that apocalyptic scene out of my head. Those screams of pain and suffering make it hard to breathe.
Part 9: Cretan Labyrinth I

9

...Temporary command post, Berlin.

Commander: ...That's concludes my report, Sir.

Commander: The information presented earlier was taken from Machlian's virtual consciousness. Do you have any more questions?

Griffin: ...

Griffin scrolls through the recorded images from Machlian's virtual consciousness and studies them carefully.

Griffin: I see.

Griffin: They figured that the government would be unable to stop so many small-scale explosions in so many regions.

Griffin: This would be much more fail-safe compared to a single big terrorist attack.

Griffin: Truly a meticulous plan.

Commander: It seems you are already aware of this information.

Griffin: I only knew that the plan existed, but not the specifics of its implementation.

Griffin: Still, I'd like to ask—given what you know of Machlian, how reliable is the information recovered from her?

Commander: I understand your concern.

Commander: After all, we successfully extracted Machlian and recovered information pertaining to a major Paradeus conspiracy from her without a hitch.

Commander: Everything has gone too smoothly, and success of this sort does seem strange.

Griffin: Have you eliminated the possibility that those memories could have been implanted?

Commander: We've already checked carefully, and they are definitely not external data.

Commander: However, there is one thing that still baffles me.

Griffin: The identity of Machlian, you mean?

Commander: I still don't know what role she plays in the plan.

Commander: Her memories were destroyed by someone. They are a jumbled mess and there's no way to tell what she's been through.

Commander: We cannot determine if she's bait or some unexpected element of the plan.

Griffin: Whatever she is, she's worth looking into.

Commander: Correct. Whether this is a trap or genuine information about their plan, we will be able to learn something about the orchestrator by pursuing this lead.

Commander: I need to find the location described in this memory fragment and investigate further.

Commander: I'm going to find out if these events have already transpired but were obfuscated, or if they're still in the planning stage.

Griffin: Don't worry about resources; requisition as many as you need.

Griffin: But I need a more detailed report and images of all the memory fragments.

Griffin: I hope we can be frank with each other in this exchange of information.

Griffin: After all, we have a shared goal of averting disaster and making this world a better place.

Commander: Understood.

Griffin: I'll be waiting for good news from you, then.

The transmission ends.

Commander: RO, Perosa, gather everyone.

RO635: Yes, Commander!

Perosa: Understood!

Commander: Dandelion, select a team to dive into Machlian's memories with you. Pick out all the scenes of the disaster as soon as possible.

Dandelion: Alright, the Doll access bridge is up.

Dandelion: Ready to begin at any time.
Part 10: CL II - Memory Fragment A

...Pale yellow mist fills the underground passage.

This is supposed to be rush hour, yet the subway station is silent.

Several black-clothed girls hop, skip and jump along the tracks, humming a strange rhyme.

Black Nyto: "Who killed Cock Robin?"

Black Nyto: "I, said the Sparrow, with my bow and arrow, I killed Cock Robin."

Black Nyto: "Who saw him die?"

Black Nyto: "I, said the Fly, with my little teeny eye, I saw him die."

The office workers on the railway platform would normally be chatting away. Instead, they're now lying quietly on the platform, seemingly fast asleep. They do not respond even when the black-clothed girls tread on them...

Black Nyto: "Who caught his blood?"

White Nyto: "I, said the Fish, with my little dish, I caught his blood."

...The pale yellow mist stretches out to a familiar village.

Pale and bony refugees wail and cry in despair as they fall to this insidious and deadly mist, one after another.

The white-clothed girls smile and chant their rhyme while passing through the refugee's corpses, oblivious to the hellish sight around them.

White Nyto: "Who'll make the shroud?"

White Nyto: "I, said the Beetle, with my thread and needle, I'll make the shroud."

White Nyto: "Who'll dig his grave?"

White Nyto: "I, said the Owl, with my pick and shovel, I'll dig his grave."

A frail woman crawls along the ground, her face streaked with tears. She is desperately clinging to her last hope.

The white-clad girls walk towards her steadily, closing the distance between them, until the woman can see the blood dripping from the tips of the scythes in their hands...

The woman opens her mouth in terror, as if to scream for the last time in her life—

□□□: Aaaaahhhhhh—

The mournful wail of a young girl suddenly fills the dead silent village.

□□□: Mama!!! Papa!!!

□□□: Don't leave me... Nooooo!!!

So piteous is her howl that even the birds flying overhead stop to offer their sympathies.

Unfortunately, in this village where all is still, the only one left alive is a sobbing girl.

□□□: Wake up! Please wake up!!!

As the inconsolable girl is crying her heart out, an unfamiliar voice echoes from far in the distance...

□□: Wonderful! Wonderful! A pan-immunosome!

□□□: ...(Sob) What? Who are you?

A man with a blurry, distorted face runs over in delight and holds out his hand.

□□: Hello, I am □□.

□□□: I don't know you...

The girl clutches her mother's still-warm hand fearfully.

□□: Don't be scared. We're here to help you.

□□: Your mother and father are asleep, but you have the power to wake them up.

□□: And I know how to help you...

□□□: But...

□□: Don't you want to bring back your mommy and daddy?

□□□: I do...

□□: Right now, I'm the only one who can save your parents.

She hesitantly reaches up to the man before her...

A pair of tightly clasped hands are parted.

The souls clinging to each other are torn apart.

□□□: No...no...

Her head feels like it would explode, but she still tries to reach out with her hands, seeking to grasp the warmth that she has lost.

□□□: No... Don't take her away!

□□□: Please, I'm begging you!!!

This is a vast laboratory with people milling around, but her cries are completely ignored, just like in that dead silent village.

□□□: Please!!! Please!!!

□□□: Give her back to me!!! She's a part of me!!!

□□□: She's my other half...

□□: Hm?

The man with the blurred and twisted face looms high above, looking down on her.

□□: You are worthless.

□□: Your only value is to provide her vessel with a soul.

□□□: ...

□□: Oh, don't worry, I won't let you go to sleep just like that.

□□: I will always remember the sense of defeat you made me feel...

Someone savagely seizes her neck, making it hard to breathe...

□□: I was so close... So close to success...

□□: But because of your stubbornness, I fell short of success by just a little!!!

Her vision pulses with blackness, and her mind begins to drift away from her body.

□□: But that's alright. I've already created her using your data.

□□: And she... She will make up for your shortcomings.

□□: As for you, I will have you watch, alive, suffering, and with your eyes wide open, as that day arrives...

She can breathe again.

But she can still hear him curse her through gritted teeth.
Part 11: CL II - Memory Fragment B

...In the darkness.

Two women with indistinct faces are talking to each other.

???: ...Have things been settled in the other places?

???: Since when was it your place to question me?!

???: Just mind your own business, I don't need a hag like you nagging me about how I do my work.

???: You should know that our plan is like an arrangement of dominos, if a single part goes wrong...

???: Yes, yes, I know!

???: If a single part goes wrong, the entirety of Father's plan will be affected!

???: So how is your part going?

???: Hehe, don't you worry about my abilities.

She suddenly produces an Iaso's Box, which glows faintly with blue light...

???: I've hidden these little things all over Berlin, hahahahaha!

The shrill alarm rings continuously, drowning out the shouts of the inmates.

Inmate 1: What's going on? What happened?

Inmate 2: What's this weird smell? Someone turn on the lights!

Bang! Something explodes.

Just then, the emergency lights come on. At the same time, the security systems imprisoning these inmates suddenly stop working.

Inmate 1: What's happening?

Inmate 2: Are we free?

The inmates' delight does not last long.

They soon realize that during the recent period of deep, crushing darkness, a terrible change has taken place...

Inmate 3: What are you doing?!

ELID Infected: Aaaaarghhhhhh...

Inmate 3: I'm your friend!!! Stay back!!! Ahhh that hurts—

Inmate 1: Help me!!!

Their former cellmates have transformed into fearsome monsters which are now lunging and tearing at the fleeing human inmates.

Said inmates run around in a blind panic, not noticing the open Iaso's Boxes lying quietly on the floor...

Boom!

A continuous series of explosions bring forth blossoms of fire on the surface of the quarantine wall.

Quarantine Wall Defender: No! No!!!

Quarantine Wall Defender: The quarantine wall has fallen!

Quarantine Wall Defender: The wall is down!

As the crowd watches in dismay, the quarantine wall, which has withstood wind and rain and protected the city for many years, collapses like a toppled sand castle.

Behind it, a pale yellow mist sweeps in like a sandstorm...

A petite figure tramples the remains of the quarantine wall underfoot, cradling an Iaso's Box as she shrieks with peals of mad laughter.

???: Ahahahahahaha! This is your doomsday!

???: Run! Run like mad! Run like sheep being chased by hyenas!

???: We will be there sooner or later! Because we are everywhere!

...A woman's hysterical laughter echoes in the darkness, while the other woman remains silent.

???: So does that mean everything is ready? I'll report it to my teacher, then.

???: Oh, don't give me that nonsense! I handled it in person, so how could anything go wrong?

???: Also, I'll report the mission status to Big Sister myself, now just scram!

?: I gather you've completed your mission, seeing that you have the time to bicker.

A third woman interjects.

The moment she speaks, the other two immediately bow their heads in reverence.

???: Teacher, everything is ready on my end...

???: Big Sister, I've finished all my tasks, too!

?: Very good. Father will reward you for your efforts.

?: Now then, there is only one last thing to do...

???: Let me do it, Big Sis!

???: I'll be so happy every bone in my body will dance a jig If I get to kill that woman!

???: ...

?: No, I must finish off that woman personally.

?: This is the mission I was given from the moment I was born, after all.

The third woman slowly approaches, the sound of her high heels tapping out crisp notes on the floor.

Clack...clack...clack...

Neither quick nor slow, but each step is filled with lethal menace.

Clack...clack...clack...

Every beat feels like a stomp on her heart.

Clack...

She is here.
Part 12: CL II - Memory Fragment C

...Inkblots.

Inkblots of all shapes and sizes.

They're everywhere, bewildering the eyes.

□□: Tell me, what do you see?

□□□: ...

□□: I advise you not to test my patience.

□□□: ...

□□: This is the last time I'm asking you, what do you see in the inkblot?

□□□: ...

□□□: The remains of corpses.

□□: You worthless piece of trash!!!

□□□: Blood, it's blood...

A heavy slap across her face sends her reeling.

□□: Blood? Heh... Well, that IS one of your few uses.

□□: Now that you mention it, is it time to draw blood today?

Her arm is firmly secured, and a sharp razor blade cuts her skin.

Blood gushes out into the container.

Assistant: Professor, I think that's enough...

□□: Relax, it's not like she'd die.

□□: Good dogs fight back when they can't take any more abuse. A worthless mutt like her will live to the end, even if she has no pride to speak of.

The blood flows down the outside of the container, dripping onto the ground...

Drip...drip...

The IV bottle connected to her wrist steadily drips its liquid.

The base is unusually noisy today.

Nyto's Voice: Faster, move it faster. Father said he wants everything transferred by today.

□□□: ...

She carefully pulls out the IV catheter, and the alarm goes off, as expected.

Nyto's Voice: Don't look around! Our schedule is packed! Pick up the pace!

After a while, nobody has come around to check on her, and the sound of the alarm has died down.

Her heartbeat suddenly speeds up in excitement.

□□□: Is anyone...there...?

Nobody answers.

She stands up and pushes open the door to the treatment room.

There are no obstacles in the empty corridor.

Her footsteps slowly pick up speed, getting faster and faster, until she's in a flat-out sprint...

...At the truck dispatch point.

Black Nyto: ...This is the last batch of trash that needs disposing. We'll head out in five minutes.

Black Nyto: Once we've taken care of it, we'll proceed directly to the new base.

White Nyto: Good. Don't waste any time along the way.

White Nyto: If you're discovered or followed, take care of them by yourself. Remember to destroy all the evidence.

Black Nyto: Understood.

She holds her breath, and climbs into the cabin filled with abandoned Isomers.

She pulls off a black cape and drapes it over herself, then she pulls apart the girls' cold corpses and squeezes among them.

She is nervous and afraid. All she can do is close her eyes and wait for the truck to start moving.

White Nyto: It's time.

White Nyto: Go, hurry up and dispose of this trash.

The truck shudders, and finally, it begins to move.

In the distance, she hears a panicked alarm coming from the base...
Part 13: CL II - Memory Fragment D

13

...Icy rain water splashes on her face.

It awakens the girl who has escaped the base, buried among the abandoned Isomers.

□□□: ...

She pushes away the abandoned Isomers on top of her and slowly stands up.

There are corpses of little girls as far as the eye can see.

□□□: ...Who am I?

□□□: Ma...chlian...

She manages to recall her name with great effort, but more questions soon follow.

Machlian: Where...will I go?

Machlian: Where did I...come from?

In a daze, she walks out of the ditch filled with girls' corpses.

Machlian: Living...normal person...

The rain soaks the bandages on her body, and her wounds start to hurt.

Machlian: Save...save them...

A bizarre scene appears in her mind.

The scene of a catastrophe...

Machlian: I...I want to save them...

Machlian: I want...to save them...

Someone speaks from behind her.

Nyto's Voice 1: The latest batch of trash was all dumped here, wasn't it?

Nyto's Voice 2: Yes, big sister.

Nyto's Voice 1: Gather everyone and find her.

Nyto's Voice 2: Understood!

Machlian: No... I don't...

Machlian: I don't want to go back...

Machlian: I want... I want to save them...

She seizes onto this idea that has seeped into her mind and starts running with faltering steps...

She runs...and runs... She runs without stopping...

She doesn't know how long she has run, or how far.

???: Hey, how come you look like such a mess?

Machlian: I... Don't touch me!

Elsa: Don't be scared! My name's Elsa!

Elsa: I swear, I won't hurt you...

Machlian: ...

Elsa: You're really badly hurt...

???: Elsa, what's all this ruckus?

Elsa: Miss Elia, there's a refugee here who needs our help!

Elia: Nonsense! This is no refugee!

Elia: She's our Saint!

Elsa: Saint? She's a Saint?

Elia: Greetings, My Lady. You must have been sent by God to save us!

Machlian: I... I don't understand...

Elia: That's fine. Just come with me first.

Elia: I run a refugee shelter, and many people are waiting for you to save them there...

Machlian: Refugee...save...

Elia: Come...come with me...

Elsa: Thank goodness, we have a Saint now!

The warm little hand tightly clutches hers.

She has never met this young girl, but she feels oddly at ease around her.
Part 14: Cretan Labyrinth III

14

...Temporary command post, Berlin.

Kolibri: What happened to Machlian was horrible... They did all that to her just because they thought she was a pan-immunosome...

ST AR-15: If you've seen what Paradeus has done, you'll know that this is just child's play.

ST AR-15: She's no longer the person she originally was, and if she has some kind of ulterior motive, it'll only lead to a greater disaster.

Kolibri: Hey! Don't you have any sympathy...?

Perosa: Quiet. The Commander's giving orders.

Commander: Organize all the fragments related to the terrorist attack and send them to the Earl. Ask him to help us find these coordinates.

Perosa: Yes. Uploading now.

Commander: ...Dandelion, when will Machlian wake up?

Dandelion: She'll regain consciousness in about five minutes. Are you going to resume the interrogation?

Kolibri: The Commander's so cruel...

Derringer: Good thing we're on the Commander's side!

Commander: ...

RO635: You're getting the wrong idea about the Commander...

Fedorov: Commander... Doesn't Machlian deserve to know that we hacked into her memories?

Kolibri: Yeah, we Dolls hate people snooping around in our memories without permission.

Derringer: After all, memories are very important to us.

ST AR-15: She's just a Paradeus captive; it's not like she has rights or anything.

ST AR-15: Besides, there's no telling if there's a bigger conspiracy surrounding her.

Dandelion: Being hacked is a common thing for Paradeus. There's no need to mention it.

Commander: That's enough. I'll inform her.

ST AR-15: ...

Kolibri: Yeah, that's the way!

Machlian: ...

Machlian is woken up by the chattering Dolls.

Commander: Do you feel unwell?

Machlian: ...

Machlian looks at her fresh bandages and says nothing.

Commander: ...We are not from Paradeus.

Machlian: Aren't you?

Machlian: I trusted you once, but I will never trust you again.

Commander: Machlian, please, calm down.

Commander: I've told you before, we did this for no other reason than to protect you.

Commander: Your violent reaction was dangerous, so I had Dandelion hack into your virtual consciousness to stop you.

Machlian: ...

Commander: I'm sorry.

Machlian: ...

Commander: We also looked through your memories without your permission.

The Commander looks down as they recall the horrific scenes they saw in Machlian's memories.

Machlian notices the Commander's clenched fists.

Commander: In your memories, we saw the many disasters caused by Paradeus.

Commander: The Nyto enforcers called it "Operation Cocoon".

Machlian: Operation Cocoon...

Commander: They set off pollen bombs in various parts of Berlin, causing the radiation intensity to go beyond Red Zone levels.

Commander: Everyone in Berlin was fleeing... But no matter how fast they ran, they weren't fast enough to avoid turning into ELIDs...

Machlian: ...

Commander: Do you know anything else about this?

Commander: Please tell me everything you know about where and when this happened!

Commander: I need to find where all the bombs are hidden and figure out exactly what's going on. Otherwise, I...

The Commander takes a deep breath and quells the rage in their heart.

Commander: I went through a living nightmare when a dirty bomb went off near me once.

Commander: I know very well how painful and torturous it is to suffer from ELID...

Commander: So I will absolutely not allow such a thing to happen.

Commander: Please, Machlian. I need your help.

Machlian: ...Are you really not with Paradeus?

Commander: I'm not. In fact, just like you, we are fighting Paradeus.

Machlian: But can I really trust you...?

Commander: If you trust me, then I will trust you.

Commander: Together, we can stop this tragedy from taking place.

Machlian's eyes glimmer as the Commander quickly summarizes the images they saw just now.

Machlian: ...

Machlian: As I thought...

Commander: I know your memories have suffered severe damage, but please tell us everything you can remember.

Machlian: ...

Commander: We saw scenes of many locations in Berlin being destroyed by Paradeus. If their plan succeeds, all of Berlin will suffer the same fate.

Commander: Can you tell us where these places are?

Machlian: It's not that I don't want to tell you...

Machlian: But my memories are so jumbled I don't know where to begin.

The Commander and the Dolls fall silent, and that makes Machlian more and more uneasy.

Machlian: I have many images in my mind, but I can't put them together to form a complete story.

Commander: That sounds very similar to the environment of your virtual consciousness.

Machlian: ...

Commander: Also, you mentioned something about curing ELID before you passed out.

Commander: How do you do it?

Machlian: ...

Machlian: With my blood.

Commander: Sorry?

Machlian: Well, not directly using my blood...

Machlian: It's more like my blood is the raw material, which is then processed...

Commander: No wonder you said everyone wanted to kidnap you...

Machlian: ...

Commander: ...

Commander: If what you say is true, then...

Commander: There must be a place where they developed a medicine that can cure or at least slow down ELID infection by experimenting with your blood.

Commander: That must be where you met Morridow.

Machlian: ...

Commander: And this place is closely connected to Paradeus.

Commander: Am I on track so far?

Machlian: Yes.

Commander: Is the medicine genuinely effective?

Machlian: It worked very well...when I used it on those refugees.

Commander: The Dolls searched you, but you weren't carrying any medicine on you. Where is the rest of it?

Machlian: ...

Machlian: I can't say.

Commander: Fair enough. Then l'll ask you again once we make a breakthrough in our investigation.

Machlian: Okay...

ST AR-15: Commander...

I take in Machlian's downcast eyes and pursed lips, I stop ST AR-15, who wants to take over the questioning.

Commander: That's enough. Let's call it a day.

...The Commander's communicator suddenly rings.

Helian: It's time for our scheduled check-in, Commander.

Helian: How's the mission going? We couldn't send anyone from the base, so I hired Squad 404.

Commander: I've already met up with 404.

Commander: Oh yes, how's Kalina doing?

Commander: Other than the message delivered by 404, I haven't heard from her since leaving the base.

Helian: Her condition is relatively stable for now. Mr. Kryuger has arranged for better medical resources for her.

Helian: I'd say Kalina will be able to resume her duties by the time you get back.

Commander: Really? Is Kalina with you right now?

Helian: You should know that regardless of severity, all ELID patients have to be quarantined.

Commander: ...

Helian: Commander, focus on finishing the mission. Mr. Kryuger and I will take care of Kalina.

Commander: Got it.

Commander: I'll return right away once I finish the mission.

Helian: Please take care of yourself too, Commander.

Commander: I will. Tell her to wait for me. I'll be back.

RO635: Commander, I'm sure Miss Kalina will get better.

ST AR-15: ...

Commander: It's fine. Alright, everyone who's not on duty should go get some rest.
Part 15: The Indecipherable Heart (Side)

15

...

In the afternoon.

Machlian has blearily woken from her slumber.

The Doll is sitting by the bed with her eyes closed.

Machlian: Mmm...

Perosa: You're awake.

Perosa opens her eyes upon hearing Machlian quietly stretching herself.

Perosa: Did you sleep well?

Machlian: Yeah, pretty well...

Machlian: Where are the others?

Perosa: They're outside, trying to figure out how to cook for humans. Judging by the ruckus, I don't think it's going too well.

Machlian: ...

Machlian turns to listen. Indeed, a squabble seems to be happening outside the room, but she can't quite make out what it's about.

Perosa: Would you like to step outside and take a look? Walking helps clear your head after you wake up.

Machlian: Alright.

Machlian rises from the bed and follows Perosa out of the room.

Several Dolls are engaged in a heated argument.

The stove is covered with several pans of charred, unidentifiable objects.

Kolibri: ...I couldn't stomach your cooking even with my taste module switched off!

Derringer: What do YOU know? These snacks are part of my private reserve!

Kolibri: But that doesn't mean you can FRY them!

Derringer: The Commander wanted some hot food!

Machlian: ...

Perosa: What are you arguing about?

Savage: Perosa, they're debating whether you can deep fry cookies with other food ingredients.

Fedorov: Hurry up and think of something, Perosa, they've ruined several plates already...

Machlian walks up to the stove, lightly breaks off a small chunk of the unidentifiable black substance and tastes it...

Machlian: ...

Machlian: This is...

A pungent stench of fish wrapped in a sick-inducing sweetness washes over her, rushing into her mouth like a gigantic deep sea shark and trying to burst out the top of her skull...

Machlian's legs give out and she crumples to the floor.

Perosa: Machlian! Are you alright?

Perosa: Get some water!

Savage: Quick, rinse her mouth out with the water!

Machlian finally comes to after they pour big mouthfuls of clean water into her.

After seeing Machlian's reaction to just a tiny bite of their cooking, Kolibri and Derringer are even more crestfallen.

Perosa: Keep an eye on Machlian. Let me handle it.

Savage: Huh, I haven't seen Perosa cook in a while.

Fedorov: Let me help too.

Perosa skillfully descales and washes the fish, then she chops its head off and debones it before cutting it into strips and covering them in flour.

After that, Perosa places the prepared fish and the fries that Fedorov made into the hot oil.

Soon, there is a golden-brown platter of fish and chips on the dining table.

Kolibri: Wow—

Derringer: Perosa, you're amazing!

Machlian: It smells delicious...

Perosa puts a portion in front of Machlian.

Perosa: This is yours.

Machlian: F-For me? Thank you?

The Dolls look on enviously as Machlian picks up a french fry and puts it in her mouth gingerly...

The AR Team has finished their shopping and returned to the temporary command post just in time to see this.

M4 SOPMOD II: Wow, smells great! Whatcha eating?

ST AR-15: You're done preparing the Commander's afternoon tea? I'll go call them now.

ST AR-15 heads over to the Commander's room.

RO635: Looks like English cuisine.

M4 SOPMOD II: Man, this reminds me of our cafeteria back at the base!

RO635: We'll be able to eat there again once we go back.

Machlian slowly chews the fry in her mouth. It's crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. Cooked with practically no added flavoring, the only thing she can taste is the natural fragrance of the potatoes.

Kolibri: Does the food in your cafeteria...taste good?

Derringer: The Earl doesn't like cafeterias and the like; he says there's a risk of being poisoned and all...

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? But the food at ours tastes great! We've got food from all kinds of countries.

M4 SOPMOD II: Like, when it comes to potatoes alone, we have American fries, English chips, Italian mashed potatoes, Chinese potato floss...

Derringer: Please, spare me...

Machlian looks down at the fish and chips on her plate. Just a moment ago, she had thought they were quite delicious, but all of a sudden they seem rather tasteless and bland.

Perosa: Oh, don't be so down. We may actually get to visit this legendary cafeteria one day.

Kolibri: Really?

Savage: I believe the Earl means for us to stay and operate with the Commander on a long-term basis.

Fedorov: The fact is that we still don't know enough about Paradeus. We'll be able to learn a lot by following the Commander.

Derringer: Wow, I'm really looking forward to it...

Machlian finds herself nodding too as she picks up a cup of tea.

M4 SOPMOD II: So how about saying hi to everyone?

Savage: Saying hi?

M4 SOPMOD II: Well, you make a video to say hi and introduce yourselves so everyone at the base can get to know you ahead of time!

RO635: I'm sure the Commander won't mind. I'll confirm it with the Commander later.

The members of Squad Griffin all turn to look at Perosa.

Perosa: Well, since you're obviously really looking forward to it, I can't bring myself to say no either.

Kolibri: Awesome! Let me go clean myself up!

Derringer: What should I say to everyone at the base...?

M4 SOPMOD II: Hurry! Banana's already recording!

The members of Squad Griffin take turn walking up to Banana and introducing themselves.

Perosa however, goes over to Machlian.

Perosa: Aren't you coming?

Machlian: I'm not sure I'm welcome there...

Perosa: From what I know of the Commander, we might very well meet again at the base after the mission is over.

Machlian: Um...

Machlian squeezes her cup uneasily. The liquid inside is perfectly still.

The Commander comes out from the command room and into the kitchen with ST AR-15.

Commander: Mm, smells great.

RO635: It's fish and chips, cooked by Perosa herself.

Commander: Looks delicious too. Don't mind if I do.

M4 SOPMOD II: Commander, I want to make a video of Squad Griffin saying hi to everyone back at the base!

M4 SOPMOD II: I'm sure they'll be happy to know that we're getting some nice additions!

Commander: Sounds good to me.

Perosa: Commander, Machlian hasn't introduced herself yet.

Perosa smiles and drags Machlian over.

She blushes bright red, not knowing where to look.

ST AR-15: Commander, she's not—

M4 SOPMOD II: It's fine, 15. You've seen the bunch from Sangvis Ferri having fun at the base.

The Commander shoots ST AR-15 a placating look and pushes the plate of fries toward her.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15 doesn't touch the fries, but she doesn't protest any further.

Commander: Come on, Machlian.

M4 SOPMOD II: Here, look this way and say something!

Machlian walks in front of Banana and looks uncertainly into the camera.

For a moment, she is overcome by conflicting emotions as countless scenes from the past, both bitter and sweet, flash through her mind.

Machlian: ...Hello, my name is Machlian.
Part 16: Dreams on the Island of Dia I

16

...That night, in Machlian's room in the temporary command post.

ST AR-15 stands by Machlian's bed, looking down at her sleeping face with unbridled hostility.

ST AR-15: Stop pretending.

Machlian: ...

ST AR-15: I know you're only faking it.

Machlian: ...

Deep in the realm of sleep, Machlian does not respond to ST AR-15's accusation.

Dandelion: I never thought Dolls could go crazy...until tonight.

ST AR-15: I knew you'd show up too.

Dandelion: If I hadn't, you'd have dragged her out by the collar, wouldn't you?

ST AR-15: Did you come here just to take shots at me?

Dandelion: Of course not. I could have done it during the day too.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: You're also suspicious of her.

Dandelion: Well, not so much suspicious as curious.

Dandelion: Machlian's virtual consciousness is unique. Chaotic virtual consciousness is commonplace in Paradeus units, but this is the first time I've seen such a spectacular mess.

Dandelion: And that doesn't even begin to cover how she actually has scenes in her head which seem to foretell the future.

ST AR-15: I just think she has an ulterior motive.

ST AR-15: For all we know, getting caught by the Commander was part of her plan.

Dandelion: Well, I don't see why we can't carry out our respective investigations.

Dandelion looks down at her arm, which ST AR-15 is holding in a vise-like grip.

ST AR-15: ...I'm not specialized in electronic warfare.

Dandelion: So you want me to build a link for you to enter Machlian's virtual consciousness?

ST AR-15: Yes.

Dandelion: That is no problem at all. You just have to...

Dandelion: Beg me.

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion feels the grip on her arm tighten further.

Dandelion: You DO know that a Nyto's body has no sense of pain, right?

ST AR-15: Cut the crap and build the link.

Dandelion: You have a very interesting way of begging for help.

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion: I don't want to go out of my way to make things difficult for you, so how about we make a deal?

ST AR-15: What do you have in mind?

Dandelion: I want 10 instances of immunity. When I invoke them, you cannot attack me for my words.

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion: You're not willing?

Dandelion: Forget it, then.

ST AR-15: Fine, it's a deal.
Part 17: Dreams II mid-stage

17

...Inside Machlian's virtual consciousness.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15: I didn't think this place would be even more of a mess than it looked from the outside.

Dandelion: "15, I'm here, save me."

ST AR-15: What the hell?! Who gave you permission to talk like M4?!

Dandelion: Immunity instance 1 of 10.

ST AR-15: ...

ST AR-15 clenches her fists and stalks silently toward a distant fragment.

...It appears to be a factory.

Several white Nytos are checking production line data.

Girl's Voice: Have we met our production quota for today?

A girl's voice comes out of nowhere. The white Nytos bow respectfully in response.

White Nyto: We have met our quota for the day.

White Nyto: But the memory scrub hasn't been entirely successful with several of the modified units. They ripped off their inhibitors and modifications without permission.

Girl's Voice: Did their virtual consciousnesses break down?

White Nyto: No, their memories have simply regressed to before the scrub and modification, and they do not remember anything about Father.

White Nyto: They have been taken to the detention cell. One of them refers to herself as "Adeline" and is crying about finding a human called "Mama".

Girl's Voice: ...

Girl's Voice: Well, tearing off their modifications does run the risk of that.

Girl's Voice: Take them to Father's lab.

White Nyto: Yes.

Girl's Voice: We must prevent this sort of thing from happening again.

White Nyto: Understood.

The girl speaks no more, but the white Nytos still stand rooted to the spot, their heads bowed fearfully.

...In Machlian's virtual consciousness.

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion: I've already read all the fragments over there, but the details are still being compiled.

ST AR-15: Can those Nytos' memories be restored?

Dandelion: If the events in the fragments are genuine, then yes.

Dandelion: In theory, if you remove their modifications and perform a personality reset, there's a chance they would regain their memories.

Dandelion: But exactly how much and to what extent they can be restored—I'm not too sure.

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion: Rather than pity these girls, we have more important things to do.

Dandelion: For instance, figuring out when this region appeared.

ST AR-15: What region?

ST AR-15 looks back and sees a red-colored region that has appeared behind Dandelion at some point.

The red is very bright and contrasts starkly with the other areas of Machlian's virtual consciousness.

Stranger still is the fact that there are no fragments in that region at all. It looks just like a big red snowstorm that covers up everything within.

ST AR-15: What?!

ST AR-15: That wasn't there just a moment ago.

Dandelion: Yes, once I secured control access over the virtual cognition image, a big region that I hadn't seen before silently appeared behind my back.

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion: I also tried entering it while you were still spacing out.

Dandelion: But I can't seem to hack it with just my mind.

ST AR-15: Have you heard the saying—

Dandelion: If you're going to say something like "what goes around comes around", you can save it.

Dandelion: Remember, discovering Machlian's true aim to save our guileless and compassionate Commander was also your plan.

ST AR-15: ...Humph, you think I really don't know why you came to investigate Machlian in the middle of the night? You're just doing it to satisfy your own curiosity.

ST AR-15: Saving the Commander was incidental at best.

Dandelion: In terms of the outcome, it makes no difference what my motives are.

ST AR-15: Shut up and get started.
Part 18: Dreams II mid-stage

18

...In Machlian's room.

M4 SOPMOD II: 15, I'm here to change shifts!

ST AR-15: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: 15!

SOP-II shakes ST AR-15, but ST AR-15's eyes remain shut. There is no response.

M4 SOPMOD II: Huh? What are you doing?

M4 SOPMOD II: Dandelion is also here...

M4 SOPMOD II: Ohhhh, I know! You're in Machlian's virtual consciousness!

SOP-II runs in a circle around ST AR-15 and Dandelion.

M4 SOPMOD II: Are you guys in there? Take me too!

M4 SOPMOD II: I wanna go in there and see...

ST AR-15: ...

Dandelion: ...

M4 SOPMOD II: Why are you all ignoring me?!

M4 SOPMOD II: You meanies! I'm going to tell RO and the Commander!

SOP-II turns and is just about to storm off when her fingers brush against a marker pen in her pocket.

M4 SOPMOD II: Hm, wait a minute...

SOP-II looks back, and her gaze falls on ST AR-15's clean face...

M4 SOPMOD II: Heehee, it's done!

M4 SOPMOD II: You're an artistic genius, SOP-II!

SOP-II beams with pride at her work of graffiti.

M4 SOPMOD II: Now for the next one!

SOP-II skips over to Dandelion and raises the marker up to Dandelion's face.

Dandelion's eyes suddenly snap open and her hand shoots up to grab SOP-II by the wrist.

Dandelion: Stop it, SOP-II.

M4 SOPMOD II: Holy!

Dandelion: 15 and I are on an urgent mission from the Commander. Don't disturb us.

M4 SOPMOD II: I can help too!

Dandelion: You going back to your room like a good girl would be the biggest help of all.

M4 SOPMOD II: Humph!

A disgruntled SOP-II tosses the marker away and leaves Machlian's room.

...Inside Machlian's virtual consciousness.

The monsters guarding the blank zone have been pretty much eliminated.

ST AR-15: Where were you? I was calling you for ages but you didn't respond.

Dandelion: ...It was nothing.

Dandelion eyes ST AR-15's face with amusement before heading for the heart of the blank region.

Dandelion: It's done.

ST AR-15: So it's unlocked?

Dandelion: Yeah.

A black cube appears in the red region, and ST AR-15's hand reaches toward it...

...In an unfamiliar village.

The Epiphylla have all blossomed, spewing pale yellow pollen like an explosion and drowning the entire village in it.

Morridow: You've done very well.

Villager: Oh, it was nothing, we simply did as you told us, Lady Morridow...

Morridow: And now that you have finished your mission, you are no longer of any value.

Villager: ...What?

Whoosh—

With movements that are invisible to the naked eye, Morridow cuts the prostrating villager into two.

Blood splashes onto Morridow's face, making her look sinister and fearsome.

Morridow: Go see if there are more survivors in the village.

White Nyto: Understood.

White Nytos surge into the village shrouded in yellow mist. Morridow licks the blood off her blade and leaves...

...In an unfamiliar room.

On the cold loor likes the corpse of a woman.

Morridow sits before the dressing mirror, looking into it as she wipes off the bloodstains and re-applies her makeup.

Morridow: "Hi, Ange. I'm Morridow, Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary. Delighted to meet you."

Morridow keeps adjusting her expression and tone in front of the mirror.

Morridow: "Hello, Frau Ange. I am Morridow Voigt, Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary."

Morridow: What do you think, hm? I'm doing a perfect impression of you, don't you agree?

Morridow pulls the corpse up by the hair with a savage grin.

Morridow: Thanks, by the way. Starting from today, I'll be living your life in your place. ♪
Part 19: Dreams II End

19

...Inside Machlian's virtual consciousness.

ST AR-15: Dammit, I TOLD you, she's Morridow!

Dandelion: There are a lot of other people's memory fragments in her virtual consciousness. This is rather unusual for a Nyto.

Dandelion: Given the current circumstances, the chances of Machlian and Morridow being the same person are very high.

ST AR-15: So even you agree...

ST AR-15: I'm going to tell the Commander right now, and you're coming with me.

Dandelion: Very well.

ST AR-15 immediately exits of Machlian's virtual consciousness.

Dandelion peers at the black cube floating above the blank region one last time.

Dandelion: Things are getting more and more interesting.
Part 20: Dreams on the Island of Dia III

20

...In the Commander's office.

It is late at night, and the Commander is puzzling over a stack of files.

ST AR-15 suddenly bursts in with Dandelion in tow.

ST AR-15: Commander, I have an urgent matter to report.

Commander: What is it?

The Commander takes a mouthful of tea and looks up with sleepy eyes.

At the sight of ST AR-15's face, the tea is ejected in a violent spray.

Commander: Pfffft—

Commander: 15, you...

ST AR-15: Hear me out, Commander.

ST AR-15: Dandelion and I just went and checked Machlian's virtual consciousness and we found a region in there that was hidden during the daytime.

Commander: Wait, didn't I already tell—

ST AR-15: This is very important, Commander!

Commander: Alright, go on.

ST AR-15: After unlocking this region, Dandelion and I saw Morridow's memories.

ST AR-15: We saw how Morridow massacred refugees and how she killed and replaced Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary...

Commander: What?!

ST AR-15: She has Morridow's memories! Machlian IS Morridow, Commander!

ST AR-15: Dandelion saw it all, and she shares my opinion.

Dandelion: ...Frankly speaking, I no longer agree with ST AR-15.

ST AR-15: Say what?!

Dandelion: A Nyto's virtual consciousness has always been very chaotic, and they often merge consciousnesses to exchange information.

Dandelion: Machlian looks identical to Morridow, so it's hardly unusual that her virtual consciousness might possess memory fragments from the other person.

Dandelion: Of course, I'm not dismissing the possibility that Machlian could be Morridow. I'm just saying there might be another explanation.

ST AR-15: You're doing this on purpose.

Dandelion: In any case, the Commander can see for themselves and make the final decision.

Commander: Put the video on the main screen.

Dandelion: All attempts to record information within that region failed. I cannot project it.

ST AR-15: Then let's go into Machlian's mind again. Please watch, Commander.

Commander: ...Right, let's go.

...In Machlian's room.

The Commander has returned together with ST AR-15 and Dandelion.

Machlian: ...Hm? What's wrong?

ST AR-15: We know everything, Morridow.

Machlian: What...?

Dandelion: You may enter, ST AR-15.

Dandelion opens the link, and the monitor shows Machlian's virtual cognition image.

Machlian: Is this...my mind?

Having come this way before, ST AR-15 navigates through the space with ease and makes her way to where the blank region was, but in its place is a chaotic mess of memory fragments.

ST AR-15: Why is this happening, Dandelion?

Dandelion: ...I do not know either.

ST AR-15: Machlian, what have you done?!

Machlian: Huh? I don't know...

ST AR-15: Dammit!

Unwilling to give up, ST AR-15 keeps looking through the fragments, but none of them belong to Morridow.

ST AR-15: This is impossible! It was right here just now!

Commander: Come out for now, 15.

ST AR-15 reluctantly exits the virtual cognition image.

ST AR-15: I'm serious, Commander! It was right there!

Commander: ...

Commander: We can find that region again later.

Commander: But 15...

The Commander gestures vaguely at their face. Confused, ST AR-15 looks at a mirror...

ST AR-15: ......

ST AR-15: DANDELION!!!

ST AR-15: I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!

Dandelion: Immunity instance 2 of 10.
Part 21: Dreams on the Island of Dia IV

    21chevron_right

...Late at night, in the Commander's office.

After sending ST AR-15 and Dandelion away with great difficulty, the Commander makes a call.

Commander: Persica, what do you make of the video that RO sent you earlier today?

Persica: Right, right, right, just a little to the left. No, a bit further up. Yes, that's it, that's it.

Persica: Wait a minute, don't put my bookshelf down like—

Crash—

Persica: (Sighs) Moving is such a pain.

Persica: Ahhh, forget it, you guys just pack up for now.

Persica: Commander, with all the Dolls at the base, have you considered opening a home mover's division? All the moving companies on the market are so unreliable...

Commander: ...

Commander: Are you STILL moving in?

Persica: Yeah, the space I was assigned at your base was too small for me. Plus, there's all this equipment in my room that's old enough to be my grandfather.

Commander: But we bought those just two years ago...

Persica: Also, my coffee machine broke. How am I supposed to work like that?

Commander: ...

Commander: The Café is just below you, you know. While the staff is probably resting, you can still use the coffee vending machine.

Persica: Huh? I didn't know you guys provided such services...

Persica vanishes from the transmission window.

A while later, she returns with a cup of coffee, looking very satisfied.

Persica: I live again.

Persica: Right, now I can start working.

Persica starts dumping cubes of sugar into the coffee cup.

Persica: I watched the video you had RO send me earlier.

Commander: I want to hear your thoughts.

Persica: I can't be 100% sure, but I did try to cross-reference it with news records in Berlin over the years and nothing like it has happened before.

Commander: Which means?

Persica: At first, I thought it might be some kind of commercial movie or something, but considering the image quality...

Persica: I don't think anyone with that kind of money would be bored enough to make such a film.

Commander: We did some analysis on our own, and no matter how you look at it, it doesn't look forged.

Persica: Dandelion concluded that Machlian's virtual consciousness is so fragile it can't withstand the strain of a memory fragment transfer.

Persica: So we can only assume that the images are real, they just haven't happened yet.

Commander: So that terrifying apocalypse will actually come to pass...

Persica: Well, you might have a chance to stop it, Commander.

Commander: ...

Persica: Also, I'm quite intrigued by the blank region that 15 said suddenly appeared in Machlian's virtual consciousness.

Persica: Unfortunately, all the data she recorded was useless, and I can't study it further...

Commander: Care to speculate about it?

Persica: I do have some ideas about what might be going on...

Persica: But since this sort of thing has only happened once before, I'm not sure how useful my theories may be.

Persica: Compared to the first two hacking attempts, 15 and Dandelion did it while Machlian was asleep.

Persica: Simply put, it's like how human beings have the lowest control over their conscious minds when they're asleep.

Persica: Considering that Machlian is a new model of Paradeus Nyto, and that her virtual cognition image is similar to that of a human's subconscious, my guess is that her defensive mechanisms are lowered when she's sound asleep, to an extent.

Persica: Hacking her during this time does have a possibility of revealing what is normally hidden.

Commander: You mean Machlian is deliberately concealing these memories of Morridow's?

Persica: I have several theories. This is just one of them.

Commander: What are the others?

Persica: Do you understand the concept of telepathic connection among Isomers?

Persica: Early on in Tallinn, I realized that these Isomers possessed the ability to share senses without the use of communication devices.

Persica: While this sort of phenomenon doesn't allow for the stable transfer of large quantities of high-definition information, it's more than enough to allow portions of their memories to be transmitted to similar entities who can receive this sensory induction.

Commander: So basically, Machlian could simply have received a transmission containing fragments of Morridow's memories?

Persica: Yes. But the fact that she can receive those images already proves that Machlian is the same kind of Paradeus unit as Morridow.

Commander: ...

Persica: I also have another hypothesis, though it may sound a little far-fetched.

Commander: Go on.

Persica: Although Machlian's body has been modified, she is still within the parameters of a human being.

Persica: Information is transmitted within the human body in two ways—through chemical reactions and potential differences.

Persica: Both methods involve the generation of various chemical elements or electrical charges within a cell.

Persica: When a human stands next to someone with completely identical genes, he or she can be very sensitive to signals sent through transmission methods that are very similar to their own.

Commander: Hm? In other words...

Persica: In layman's terms, you could say that they have a telepathic connection in the way identical human twins share a bond.

Commander: ...You mean Machlian might be Morridow's twin sister?

Commander: And the presence of Morridow's memories in her virtual consciousness could be due to influences from Morridow's electromagnetic field?

Persica: Of course, that's just a hypothesis.

Persica: In order to verify it, I would need samples of Machlian's and Morridow's DNA for comparison.

Persica: But if this hypothesis is valid, it means Morridow might be able to see you through Machlian's eyes, so you'd better be careful, Commander.

The Commander takes a sip of cold tea and grimaces at the bitterness.

Persica: What's wrong? You can't even find someone to make you coffee without Kalina by your side?

Commander: Ahem, that'll change when I return.

Persica: But Kalina won't be able to make coffee for you for a while, no?

Persica: You'll be lucky if she can even talk to you when you get back.

Commander: What do you mean?

Persica: You didn't know?

Persica: Kalina was transferred to a city general hospital today because her condition got worse. Apparently they found minor silicification on her skin.

Thud. The tablet slips out of the Commander's hand and crashes to the floor.

Persica still seems to be saying something, but the Commander can no longer hear her.

The world is dead silent. The Commander's promise echoes in their own ears.

"Tell her to wait for me. I'll be back."

AK-12: In order to reduce my processing load, I usually "close" my eyes. Don't worry though, as this does not affect my vision nor judgment.

AK-12: People don't need to force themselves this hard. After all, not everyone is born to be chosen by the call of duty.

AK-12: Hm? What are you doing being all sneaky peeky like, Commander? Something interesting going on?

AK-12: I didn't have much faith in you at first, Commander.

AK-12: But you always stayed fresh and unique, so I couldn't keep my eyes off you...

AK-12: My, is this what they call charisma? I'm expecting great things from you...

AK-12: Hm...a new Commander? Let's just see how long you'll keep me entertained.

AK-12: ...Hmm? Are you sneaking peeks at me? We're already used to each other, so why not just look at me properly?

AK-12: Hm...a new Commander? Let's just see how long you'll keep me entertained.

AK-12: I can tell it's you without having to look, Commander.

AK-12: A new employee? Hurry up and introduce yourself!

AK-12: If only that person is here too...

AK-12: Performance upgrade is a waste without tactical understandings.

AK-12: Dummy doll's performance cannot be compare to me. I have to rely on myself of course!

AK-12: Don't need any deep computation for this kind of missions.

AK-12: Finally done. Whats up next.

AK-12: Starting automated operations.

AK-12: Time to get serious, mission start.

AK-12: Prepare for attack.

AK-12: Radar scan, start.

AK-12: Deep computating mode.

AK-12: Removing fire rate limit.

AK-12: Damage exceeds predicted levels.

AK-12: Mission failed, preparing to retreat.

AK-12: Saving mission results... Save complete.

AK-12: Verifying mission data.

AK-12: What is it? Ah, it's just candy. Ah, look over there! There's a shrine maiden!

AK-12: I love this season. The crimson red of blood on pure white snow. Ah, I was talking about Santa.

AK-12: Hatsumodo? I'll pass. I already went there.

AK-12: That damn AN-94 forcing me to receive this chocolate. Ah, Commander. Are you hungry? I got sweets.

AK-12: I don't remember any of my wish. Moreover let's go to the festival already.

AK-12: Girls' Frontline!
