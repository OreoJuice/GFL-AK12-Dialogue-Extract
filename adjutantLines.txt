AK-12: In order to reduce my processing load, I usually "close" my eyes. Don't worry though, as this does not affect my vision nor judgment.

AK-12: People don't need to force themselves this hard. After all, not everyone is born to be chosen by the call of duty.

AK-12: Hm? What are you doing being all sneaky peeky like, Commander? Something interesting going on?

AK-12: I didn't have much faith in you at first, Commander.

AK-12: But you always stayed fresh and unique, so I couldn't keep my eyes off you...

AK-12: My, is this what they call charisma? I'm expecting great things from you...

AK-12: Hm...a new Commander? Let's just see how long you'll keep me entertained.

AK-12: ...Hmm? Are you sneaking peeks at me? We're already used to each other, so why not just look at me properly?

AK-12: Hm...a new Commander? Let's just see how long you'll keep me entertained.

AK-12: I can tell it's you without having to look, Commander.

AK-12: A new employee? Hurry up and introduce yourself!

AK-12: If only that person is here too...

AK-12: Performance upgrade is a waste without tactical understandings.

AK-12: Dummy doll's performance cannot be compare to me. I have to rely on myself of course!

AK-12: Don't need any deep computation for this kind of missions.

AK-12: Finally done. Whats up next.

AK-12: Starting automated operations.

AK-12: Time to get serious, mission start.

AK-12: Prepare for attack.

AK-12: Radar scan, start.

AK-12: Deep computating mode.

AK-12: Removing fire rate limit.

AK-12: Damage exceeds predicted levels.

AK-12: Mission failed, preparing to retreat.

AK-12: Saving mission results... Save complete.

AK-12: Verifying mission data.

AK-12: What is it? Ah, it's just candy. Ah, look over there! There's a shrine maiden!

AK-12: I love this season. The crimson red of blood on pure white snow. Ah, I was talking about Santa.

AK-12: Hatsumodo? I'll pass. I already went there.

AK-12: That damn AN-94 forcing me to receive this chocolate. Ah, Commander. Are you hungry? I got sweets.

AK-12: I don't remember any of my wish. Moreover let's go to the festival already.

AK-12: Girls' Frontline!
