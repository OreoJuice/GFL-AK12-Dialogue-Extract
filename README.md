# Girl's Frontline (GFL) AK-12 dialogue extract
Python code to extract dialogue spoken by the character AK-12 from the hit game Girl's Frontline

Just run extract.py

In theory this also works for other characters if you edit the code a bit

All event text copy pasted from https://gfl.amaryllisworks.pw/

To-Do:
- ~~read all dialogue text files from separate folder (Prob have to import os)~~ done
- ~~output specific character dialogue text files to separate folder~~ done... kinda
- ~~handle ascii characters or at least this thing: ï¿½~~ done
- figure out how to convert from text file to csv without errors
- dynamic character dialogue extracting, specify which character to extract dialogue for on program start
