# dialogueExtract
Personal python code to extract dialogue from a certain character given multiple text files

Messy but it works somehow

Just run extract.py

To-Do:
- read all dialogue text files from separate folder (Prob have to import os)
- output specific character dialogue text files to separate folder
- handle ascii characters or at least this thing: ï¿½
